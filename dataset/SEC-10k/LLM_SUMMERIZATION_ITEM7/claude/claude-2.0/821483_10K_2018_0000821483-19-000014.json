MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented company based in Houston, Texas, that owns and operates market-leading energy and infrastructure businesses. For more information, please read Part I -Item 1. - Business-Overview\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRecent Events Affecting Comparability of Periods\nHawaii Refinery Expansion\nOn December 19, 2018, we completed the Hawaii Refinery Expansion for approximately $66.9 million, net of a $4.3 million receivable related to net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consisted of $47.6 million in cash and approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $19.3 million. The results of operations of the newly acquired assets are included in our refining segment commencing December 19, 2018.\nNorthwest Retail Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CHS, Inc. to acquire 33 retail outlets at various locations in Washington and Idaho. On March 23, 2018, we completed the Northwest Retail Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $74.5 million. As part of the Northwest Retail Acquisition, Par and CHS, Inc. entered into a multi-year branded petroleum marketing agreement for the continued supply of Cenex\u00ae-branded refined products to the 33 acquired Cenex\u00ae Zip Trip retail outlets.The results of operations of Northwest Retail are included in our retail segment commencing March 23, 2018. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nAmended and Restated J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements\nOn June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. Prior to June 27, 2018, we had the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $125 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Effective June 27, 2018, we have the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $165 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. On December 5, 2018, we amended and restated the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Prior Periods\nWe completed the WRC Acquisition on July 14, 2016, for cash consideration of $209.4 million, including a deposit of $5.0 million paid in June 2016 and assumed debt consisting of term loans of $58.0 million and revolving loans of $10.1 million. The results of operations of WRC are included in our segments effective July 14, 2016. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 11, 2019, we completed the Washington Refinery Acquisition for total consideration of $326.7 million, including acquired working capital, consisting of cash consideration of $289.7 million and approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock issued to the seller of U.S. Oil. The Washington refinery's results of operations will be included in our refining and logistics segments commencing January 11, 2019. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Income (Loss). Our net income decreased from $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to net income of $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in our net income was primarily driven by lower refining margins, a $10.5 million charge related to the Tesoro earn-out settlement, higher acquisition and integration costs, and a decrease in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment. Other factors impacting our results period over period include increased interest expense and financing fees, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization ( DD&A\u201d).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $132.1 million compared to $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to lower refining margins driven by unfavorable crude differentials, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment and an increase in refined product sales volumes and crack spreads.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was approximately $49.3 million compared to approximately $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to the same factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, increased interest expense and financing fees, and DD&A.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Income (Loss). During 2017, our financial performance was primarily driven by improved crack spreads, which was reflected in a change in our net income (loss) from a net loss of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to net income of $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other factors impacting our results period over period include the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC, partially offset by debt extinguishment and commitment costs and the change in value of the contingent consideration obligation during 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $140.8 million compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads and the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was income of approximately $63.3 million compared to a loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads, the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy excluding our share of Laramie's unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense and financing costs, net.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands).

These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), DD&A, RINs loss in excess of net obligation (see definition below), and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINs obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes certain direct operating expenses related to our logistics segment, unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nBeginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes RINs losses recorded in excess of our net RINs obligation ( RINs loss in excess of net obligation\u201d). Our RINs obligations to comply with RFS are recorded as liabilities and measured at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our RINs assets, which include RINS purchased in on the open market and RINs generated by blending biofuels as part of our refining process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (\"NRV\") as of the end of the reporting period. During periods of rising RINs market prices, we recognize unrealized losses associated with the increase in the fair value of our RINs liabilities. We do not adjust the carrying value of our RINs assets because such assets are stated at the lower of cost or NRV under GAAP. This adjustment represents the income statement effect of reflecting our RINs liability on a net basis, as the settlement of any open obligation would first be offset by RINs assets rather than purchasing such RINs obligations at market prices. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation.\nManagement believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing\nagreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\nAdjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,835\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RINs loss in excess of net obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment and commitment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Release of tax valuation allowance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of common stock warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,962\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and financing costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, LLC, excluding Par's share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________________________\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense or (gain) loss on sale of assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscussion of Operating Income by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $12.7 million compared to operating income of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. Another contributing factor was a decrease in RINs expense of approximately $18.5 million due primarily to our refineries obtaining a small refinery exemption for 2017 during the first quarter of 2018.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is relatively consistent with operating income of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $12.5 million compared to operating income of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 14% and an increase in sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $96.9 million compared to an operating loss of $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $28.8 million to the refining segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.6 million compared to operating income of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and higher transportation and logistics services revenue. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $6.0 million to the logistics segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.5 million compared to operating income of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 12% and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs and higher operating expenses.\nDiscussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $238.2 million, a decrease of $16.6 million compared to $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $48.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million compared to $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in barge revenues as a result of lower throughput volume and average prices per throughput barrel, partially offset by an increase in trucking volumes.\nRetail. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $107.4 million, an increase of $30.4 million compared to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in sales prices and higher sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $254.8 million, an increase of $115.7 million compared to $139.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $81.8 million and $23.7 million of Adjusted Gross Margin to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLogistics. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $55.2 million, an increase of $17.9 million compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $77.0 million, an increase of $7.1 million compared to $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 12% in sales prices and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues were $3.4 billion, a $1.0 billion increase compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and volumes. Brent crude oil prices averaged $71.55 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Refined product sales volumes increased 11% from 90.7 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 100.3 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues in our retail segment increased $114.9 million primarily driven by the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nCost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation).

The increase was primarily due to interest expense of $24.4 million related to the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes issued in December 2017 and increased financing costs of $2.4 million associated with J. Aron deferred payments, partially offset by lower interest expense of $17.4 million related to the debt and credit agreements terminated in December 2017 and a net increase on gains on interest rate derivatives of $0.9 million. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a gain of approximately $1.8 million, a change of $3.5 million compared to a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our stock price decreased from $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 to $14.18 per share as of December 31, 2018 which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share on December 31, 2017, which resulted in an increase in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration.

Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEquity Losses From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $9.5 million, a change of $8.9 million compared to equity earnings of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to Laramie Energy's loss on derivative instruments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $35.5 million for the same period in 2017. The loss on derivative instruments was partially offset by a 42% increase in Laramie Energy's sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In addition, our ownership percentage decreased from 42.3% to 39.1% on February 28, 2018 due to an investment made by a third party and increased to 46.0% on October 18, 2018 due to Laramie Energy's repurchase of units from certain unitholders.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily due to deferred tax expense of $0.7 million offset by current federal income tax benefit of $0.3 million. Deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a benefit of $0.7 million related to the release of valuation allowance due to the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation on the interest deduction limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $2.4 billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. Brent crude oil prices averaged $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $45.14 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2016, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices.

The increase is primarily due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs driven by increased headcount and severance costs incurred during the first quarter of 2017.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition and integration costs were approximately $0.4 million, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the WRC Acquisition in July 2016 compared to minor costs incurred in 2017 for the WRC integration and the pending Northwest Retail Acquisition.\nInterest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $31.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense and financing costs of $4.6 million related to the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities and Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the WRC Acquisition, higher interest expense of $5.0 million associated with our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued during the second quarter of 2016, and a $2.0 million reduction in the gain on interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense of $6.1 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and lower interest expense and financing costs of approximately $3.0 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Bridge Notes in the third quarter of 2016. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a loss of approximately $1.7 million, a change of $4.7 million when compared to a gain of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share as of December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our stock price decreased from $23.54 per share on December 31, 2015 to $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was no change in value of our contingent consideration liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the change in the value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in a gain of $10.8 million due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to PHR for 2016 as a result of lower crack spreads. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nDebt extinguishment and commitment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our debt extinguishment and commitment costs were approximately $8.6 million and represent early termination fees and the acceleration of deferred amortization costs in connection with the termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and the termination and repayment of our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017. No such costs were incurred in 2016.\nGain on curtailment of pension obligation. During December 2016, the benefit plan acquired as part of the WRC Acquisition was amended to freeze all future benefit accruals for salaried plan participants, resulting in a reduction of the projected benefit obligation of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. No amendments were made to the plan in 2017.\nEquity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2017, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $18.4 million, a change of $40.8 million compared to equity losses of $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to an increase in production volumes, natural gas prices, and an increase in our share of Laramie Energy's gain (loss) on derivative instruments of $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7.9 million primarily due to the release of $8.6 million of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with the reversal of the deferred tax liability recognized upon issuance of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes.\nConsolidating Condensed Financial Information\nOn December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC (the Issuer and Subsidiaries\u201d), issued its 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act.

Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements, fixed capacity payments and contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs, and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements, and access to capital markets.\nOur liquidity position as of December 31, 2018 was $138.8 million and consisted of $109.4 million at Par Petroleum, LLC and subsidiaries, $29.1 million at Par Pacific Holdings, and $0.3 million at all our other subsidiaries. Our consolidated liquidity position as of February 27, 2019 was approximately $144.1 million. The change in our liquidity position from December 31, 2018 to February 27, 2019 was primarily attributable to the funding for and purchase of the Washington Refinery Acquisition, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the Washington Refinery Acquisition and the funding secured through a $250 million term loan facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (the \"GS Term Loan\") and a $45 million term loan with Bank of Hawaii (the \"Par Pacific Term Loan\").\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total liquidity of $138.8 million was comprised of a deferred payment arrangement with J. Aron, availability under or available borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and cash on hand of $75.1 million. In addition, we utilize the Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron to finance the majority of the inventory at our co-located Hawaii refinery and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, utilize an intermediation agreement with Merrill Lynch to procure feedstocks for our Washington refinery. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining and retail segments, payments related to acquisitions, to repay or refinance indebtedness, and cash capital contributions to Laramie Energy.\nWe believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. Additionally, we may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes or our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, our GS Term Loan and our Par Pacific Term Loan through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nRights Offering\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued approximately 4 million shares of our common stock to certain investors at a purchase price of $12.25 per share (the Rights Offering\u201d). The gross proceeds from the Rights Offering were approximately $49.9 million, before deducting expenses of approximately $0.9 million, for net proceeds of approximately $49.0 million. The net proceeds from the Rights Offering were used to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on our Bridge Notes.\nDebt Activity\nWe had the following significant debt issuances and amendments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion.

Our capital expenditure budget for 2019 ranges from $100 to $110 million and primarily relates to the second phase of our diesel hydrotreater project to increase ultra-low sulfur distillate production capacity in our Hawaii refinery, the first phase of a project to allow for processing and storage of renewable fuels at our Washington refinery, equipment purchases and pre-engineering work in preparation for the 2020 turnarounds at our refineries, construction of the Tie-In connecting our SPM to the IES crude oil pipeline for Hawaii logistics, and scheduled maintenance and other expansion projects.\nWe also continue to seek strategic investments in business opportunities, but the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly related to our operating activities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.

Capital leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, vehicles, and information technology systems.\nPurchase Commitments. Purchase commitments primarily consist of contracts executed as of December 31, 2018 for the purchase of crude oil for use at our refineries that are scheduled for delivery in 2019.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nSupply and Offtake Agreements. On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron to support the operations of our Hawaii refinery (the Supply and Offtake Agreements\u201d). On May 8, 2017, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements and extended the term through May 31, 2021 with a one-year extension option upon mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply and Offtake Agreements were amended and restated on December 21, 2017 in connection with the issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the entry into the ABL Credit Facility. On June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Matters. Our operations and the third-party oil and gas exploration and production operations in which we have a working interest are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in the future as regulations and other conditions change.\nPeriodically, we receive communications from various federal, state, and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRegulation of Greenhouse Gases\nThe EPA has begun regulating GHG under the CAA. New construction or material expansions that meet certain GHG emissions thresholds will likely require that, among other things, a GHG permit be issued in accordance with the federal CAA regulations and we will be required in connection with such permitting to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce GHG emissions.\nFurthermore, the EPA is developing refinery-specific GHG regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose GHG emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations. Any such controls could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOn September 29, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule updating standards that control toxic air emissions from petroleum refineries, addressing, among other things, flaring operations, fenceline air quality monitoring, and additional emission reductions from storage tanks and delayed coking units. Compliance with this rule has not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows to date.\nIn 2007, the State of Hawaii passed Act 234, which required that GHG emissions be rolled back on a statewide basis to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although delayed, the Hawaii Department of Health has issued regulations that would require each major facility to reduce CO2 emissions by 16% by 2020 relative to a calendar year 2010 baseline (the first year in which GHG emissions were reported to the EPA under 40 CFR Part 98). Those rules are pending final approval by the Hawaii State Government. The capacity of our co-located refinery in Hawaii to reduce fuel use and GHG emissions is limited. However, the state's pending regulation allows, and we anticipate our co-located Hawaii refinery will be able to demonstrate, that additional reductions are not cost-effective or necessary in light of the state's current GHG inventory and future year projections. The pending regulation allows for partnering\u201d with other facilities (principally power plants) which have already dramatically reduced greenhouse emissions or are on schedule to reduce CO2 emissions in order to comply with the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards.\nFuel Standards\nIn 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act ( EISA\u201d) which, among other things, set a target fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contained an expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (the RFS2\u201d). In August 2012, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") jointly adopted regulations that establish an average industry fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025. On August 8, 2018, the EPA and NHTSA jointly proposed to revise existing fuel economy standards for model years 2021-2025 and to set standards for 2026 for the first time. The agencies have not yet issued a final rule, but they are expected to do so in 2019. Although the revised fuel economy standards are expected to be less stringent than the initial standards for model years 2021-2025, it is uncertain whether the revised standards will increase year over year. Higher fuel economy standards have the potential to reduce demand for our refined transportation fuel products.\nUnder EISA, the RFS2 requires an increasing amount of renewable fuel to be blended into the nation's transportation fuel supply, up to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. We, and other refiners subject to the RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers ( RINs\u201d), to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable fuels, we generate our own RINs for which we have the option of retaining the RINs for current or future RFS compliance or selling those RINs on the open market. The RFS2 may present production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels.\nIn October 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the federal CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10% ( E10\u201d) to 15% ( E15\u201d) for 2007 and newer light duty motor vehicles. In January 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model years 2001-2006. In 2019, EPA is expected\nto conduct a rulemaking to allow year-round sales of E15. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed on a large scale for use in traditional gasoline engines; however, increased renewable fuel in the nation's transportation fuel supply could reduce demand for our refined products.\nIn March 2014, the EPA published a final Tier 3 gasoline standard that requires, among other things, that gasoline contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) sulfur on an annual average basis and no more than 80 ppm sulfur on a per-gallon basis. The standard also lowers the allowable sulfur level in gasoline to 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) and also lowers the allowable benzene, aromatics, and olefins content of gasoline. The effective date for the new standard is January 1, 2017, however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020 to meet the standard. Our Hawaii refinery is required to comply with Tier 3 gasoline standards within 30 months of June 21, 2016, the date our Hawaii refinery was disqualified from small volume refinery status. On March 19, 2015, the EPA confirmed the small refinery status of our Wyoming refinery. The Par East facility of our Hawaii refinery, our Wyoming refinery, and our Washington refinery were all granted small refinery status by the EPA for 2017. The EPA is expected to make small refinery status determinations for 2018 in the first quarter of 2019.\nBeginning on June 30, 2014, new sulfur standards for fuel oil used by marine vessels operating within 200 miles of the U.S. coastline (which includes the entire Hawaiian Island chain) was lowered from 10,000 ppm (1%) to 1,000 ppm (0.1%). The sulfur standards began at the Hawaii refinery and were phased in so that by January 1, 2015, they were to be fully aligned with the International Marine Organization ( IMO\u201d) standards and deadline. The more stringent standards apply universally to both U.S. and foreign flagged ships. Although the marine fuel regulations provided vessel operators with a few compliance options such as installation of on-board pollution controls and demonstration unavailability, many vessel operators will be forced to switch to a distillate fuel while operating within the Emission Control Area ( ECA\u201d). Beyond the 200 mile ECA, large ocean vessels are still allowed to burn marine fuel with up to 3.5% sulfur. Our Hawaii refinery is capable of producing the 1% sulfur residual fuel oil that was previously required within the ECA. Although our Hawaii refinery remains in a position to supply vessels traveling to and through Hawaii, the market for 0.1% sulfur distillate fuel and 3.5% sulfur residual fuel is much more competitive.\nIn addition to U.S. fuels requirements, the IMO has also adopted newer standards that further reduce the global limit on sulfur content in maritime fuels to 0.5% beginning in 2020 (\"IMO 2020\"). Like the rest of the refining industry, we are focused on meeting these standards and may incur costs in producing lower-sulfur fuels.\nThere will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in the EISA, IMO 2020, and other fuel-related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.\nWyoming Refinery; Recent Acquisitions\nOur Wyoming refinery is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders, and settlement agreements involving the EPA and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. Our recent acquisition of Par East in Hawaii and the Washington refinery acquisition will also subject us to additional environmental compliance costs. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Agreement\nOn September 25, 2013, Par Petroleum, LLC, Tesoro, and PHR entered into an Environmental Agreement ( Environmental Agreement\u201d), which allocated responsibility for known and contingent environmental liabilities related to the acquisition of PHR, including the Consent Decree. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 and Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nTesoro Earn-out Dispute. On June 17, 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of Par entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Tesoro, pursuant to which it purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in PHR. The PHR acquisition was subject to an earn-out provision during the years 2014-2016, subject to, among other things, an annual earn-out cap of $20 million. On March 22, 2018, Tesoro agreed to settle the earn-out dispute and release and discharge any related claims in exchange for our payment of $10.5 million. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nBankruptcy Matters. We emerged from the reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation ( Delta\u201d) on August 31, 2012 ( Emergence Date\u201d) when the plan of reorganization ( Plan\u201d) was consummated. Please read Item 1. - Business - Bankruptcy and Plan of Reorganization\u201d of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperating Leases. We have various cancelable and noncancelable operating leases related to land, vehicles, office, and retail facilities and other facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. The majority of\nthe future lease payments relate to retail stations and facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. We have operating leases for most of our retail stations with an average term of 8 years remaining and generally containing renewal options and escalation clauses. Leases for facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products have various expiration dates extending to 2044.\nIn addition, within our corporate and other and logistics segments, we have various agreements to lease storage facilities, towboats, barges, and other equipment. These leasing agreements have been classified as operating leases for financial reporting purposes and the related rental fees are charged to expense over the lease term as they become payable. The leases generally range in duration of five years or less and contain lease renewal options at fair value.\nMinimum annual lease payments extending to 2044 for operating leases to which we are legally obligated and having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>62,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>39,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>38,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>38,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>191,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum rental payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Leases. We have capital lease obligations related primarily to the leases of 17 retail stations. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 15 years or more. Certain leases include escalation clauses and/or purchase options. Minimum annual lease payments including interest, for capital leases are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>2,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>1,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum lease payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount representing interest\n</td> <td>1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum rental payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than our operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. We analyze our estimates on a periodic basis, including those related to fair value, impairments, natural gas and crude oil reserves, bad debts, natural gas and oil properties, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies, and litigation and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out accounting method. We value merchandise along with spare parts, materials, and supplies at average cost. Estimating the net realizable value of our inventory requires management to make assumptions about the timing of sales and the expected proceeds that will be realized for the sales.\nOur refining segment acquires all of its crude oil utilized at the Hawaii refinery from J. Aron under procurement contracts. The crude oil remains in the legal title of J. Aron and is stored in our storage tanks governed by a storage agreement. Legal title to the crude oil passes to us at the tank outlet. After processing, J. Aron takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until they are sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by J. Aron on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it. The valuation of our repurchase obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices and differentials assuming settlement at the end of the reporting period. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In estimating fair value, we use discounted cash flow projections, recent comparable market transactions, if available, or quoted prices. We consider assumptions that third parties would make in estimating fair value, including the highest and best use of the asset. The assumptions used by another party could differ significantly from our assumptions.\nWe classify fair value balances based on the classification of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of a transaction. The inputs used to measure fair value have been placed in a hierarchy based on priority. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted, readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Please read Note 14-Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. We obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. These valuation methods require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding characteristics of the acquired property and future revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would result in different amounts allocated to the related assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets\nWe assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. Under the quantitative test, we compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies within our industry. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\nWe review property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying value. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined using the income approach.\nDerivatives and Other Financial instruments\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to crude oil and refined products. We manage this exposure through the use of various derivative commodity instruments. These instruments include exchange traded futures and over-the-counter swaps,\nforwards, and options.\nFor our forward contracts that are derivatives, we have elected the normal purchase normal sale exclusion, as it is our policy to fulfill or accept the physical delivery of the product and we will not net settle. Therefore, we did not recognize the unrealized gains or losses related to these contracts in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the accrual method of accounting to contracts qualifying for the normal purchase and sale exemption.\nAll derivative instruments not designated as normal purchases or sales are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. We have not designated any derivative instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges and, therefore, do not apply hedge accounting treatment.\nIn addition, we may have other financial instruments, such as warrants or embedded debt features, that may be classified as liabilities when either (a) the holders possess rights to net cash settlement, (b) physical or net equity settlement is not in our control, or (c) the instruments contain other provisions that cause us to conclude that they are not indexed to our equity. We have accounted for our obligation to repurchase crude oil and refined products from J.Aron at the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements as an embedded derivative. Additionally, we have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium on our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes represent an embedded derivative. These liabilities were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through earnings.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record asset retirement obligations ( AROs\u201d) at fair value in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by government action or contractual arrangement, to incur these costs and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. Our AROs arise from our refining, retail, and logistics operations, as well as plugging and abandonment of wells within our natural gas and crude oil operations. AROs are calculated based on the present value of the estimated removal and other closure costs using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Both expenses are recorded in Depreciation, depletion, and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the settlement amount and the recorded liability is recorded as a gain or loss on asset disposals in our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate settlement dates by considering our past practice, industry practice, management's intent, and estimated economic lives.\nWe cannot currently estimate the fair value for certain AROs primarily because we cannot estimate settlement dates (or ranges of dates) associated with these assets. These AROs include hazardous materials disposal (such as petroleum manufacturing by-products, chemical catalysts, and sealed insulation material containing asbestos) and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of our refining facilities, terminal facilities, or pipelines, including the demolition or removal of certain major processing units, buildings, tanks, pipelines, or other equipment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carry forwards. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly based on a more likely than not\u201d standard and, to the extent this threshold is not met, a valuation allowance is recorded. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future results of operations, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nBased upon the level of historical taxable income, significant book losses during the prior periods, and projections for future results of operations over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, among other factors, management concluded that we did not meet the more likely than not\u201d requirement in order to recognize deferred tax assets and therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life or increase the capacity of facilities as well as expenditures that prevent environmental contamination. We expense costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that\ndo not contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Cost estimates are based on the expected timing and extent of remedial actions required by governing agencies, experience gained from similar sites for which environmental assessments or remediation have been completed, and the amount of our anticipated liability considering the proportional liability and financial abilities of other responsible parties. Usually, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. Estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value and are presented within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Environmental expenses are recorded in Operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The results of operations of the newly acquired assets are included in our refining segment commencing December 19, 2018.\nNorthwest Retail Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CHS, Inc. to acquire 33 retail outlets at various locations in Washington and Idaho. On March 23, 2018, we completed the Northwest Retail Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $74.5 million. As part of the Northwest Retail Acquisition, Par and CHS, Inc. entered into a multi-year branded petroleum marketing agreement for the continued supply of Cenex\u00ae-branded refined products to the 33 acquired Cenex\u00ae Zip Trip retail outlets.The results of operations of Northwest Retail are included in our retail segment commencing March 23, 2018. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nAmended and Restated J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements\nOn June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. Prior to June 27, 2018, we had the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $125 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Effective June 27, 2018, we have the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $165 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. On December 5, 2018, we amended and restated the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Prior Periods\nWe completed the WRC Acquisition on July 14, 2016, for cash consideration of $209.4 million, including a deposit of $5.0 million paid in June 2016 and assumed debt consisting of term loans of $58.0 million and revolving loans of $10.1 million. The results of operations of WRC are included in our segments effective July 14, 2016. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 11, 2019, we completed the Washington Refinery Acquisition for total consideration of $326.7 million, including acquired working capital, consisting of cash consideration of $289.7 million and approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock issued to the seller of U.S. Oil. The Washington refinery's results of operations will be included in our refining and logistics segments commencing January 11, 2019. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Income (Loss). Our net income decreased from $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to net income of $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in our net income was primarily driven by lower refining margins, a $10.5 million charge related to the Tesoro earn-out settlement, higher acquisition and integration costs, and a decrease in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment. Other factors impacting our results period over period include increased interest expense and financing fees, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization ( DD&A\u201d).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $132.1 million compared to $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to lower refining margins driven by unfavorable crude differentials, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment and an increase in refined product sales volumes and crack spreads.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was approximately $49.3 million compared to approximately $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to the same factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, increased interest expense and financing fees, and DD&A.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Income (Loss). During 2017, our financial performance was primarily driven by improved crack spreads, which was reflected in a change in our net income (loss) from a net loss of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to net income of $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other factors impacting our results period over period include the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC, partially offset by debt extinguishment and commitment costs and the change in value of the contingent consideration obligation during 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $140.8 million compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads and the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was income of approximately $63.3 million compared to a loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads, the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy excluding our share of Laramie's unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense and financing costs, net.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands).

</tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Feedstocks throughput and sales volumes per day for the Wyoming refinery for 2016 are calculated based on the 171 day period for which we owned Wyoming Refining in 2016. As such, the amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the year plus the Wyoming refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the period from July 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The 2017 and 2018 amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming refineries' throughput or sales volumes averaged over the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. \n (2) The profitability of our Hawaii business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in the Singapore market. This market reflects the closest liquid market alternative to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the 4-1-2-1 Singapore crack spread (or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel), and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflects a market indicator for our Hawaii refinery operations. The previously reported 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread was calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indexes. We have revised key operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we have also excluded the Mid Pacific Crude Oil Differential from our key operating statistics as we believe this metric no longer provides a consistent and reasonable market indicator for crude purchases differentials given the unique geographical locations of our Hawaii business and the variability of our crude slate. \n (3) Please see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput. \n (4) Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations. \n (5) The profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the best market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillate (ULSD) as created from three barrels of WTI. Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota, and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado. \n (6) Operating income per bbl and Production costs per bbl for the Wyoming refinery for the year ended December 31, 2016 were retrospectively recast to reflect the reclassification of the curtailment gain of $3.1 million related to an amendment of our defined benefit pension plan from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to a newly-defined line within Total other income (expense), net, Gain on curtailment of pension obligation.

The 2017 and 2018 amounts for the total logistics segment represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming pipelines' throughput averaged over the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. \nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), DD&A, RINs loss in excess of net obligation (see definition below), and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINs obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes certain direct operating expenses related to our logistics segment, unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nBeginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes RINs losses recorded in excess of our net RINs obligation ( RINs loss in excess of net obligation\u201d). Our RINs obligations to comply with RFS are recorded as liabilities and measured at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our RINs assets, which include RINS purchased in on the open market and RINs generated by blending biofuels as part of our refining process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (\"NRV\") as of the end of the reporting period. During periods of rising RINs market prices, we recognize unrealized losses associated with the increase in the fair value of our RINs liabilities. We do not adjust the carrying value of our RINs assets because such assets are stated at the lower of cost or NRV under GAAP. This adjustment represents the income statement effect of reflecting our RINs liability on a net basis, as the settlement of any open obligation would first be offset by RINs assets rather than purchasing such RINs obligations at market prices. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation.\nManagement believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing\nagreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\nAdjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>Refining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense (excluding depreciation)\n</td> <td>146,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization\n</td> <td>32,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>(16,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RINs loss on excess of net obligation\n</td> <td>4,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on derivatives\n</td> <td>(1,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>Refining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense (excluding depreciation)\n</td> <td>141,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization\n</td> <td>29,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>(1,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain on derivatives\n</td> <td>(623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>254,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>Refining\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,934\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense (excluding depreciation)\n</td> <td>115,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization\n</td> <td>17,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>29,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss on derivatives\n</td> <td>(12,438\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense. For the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, there was no RINs loss in excess of net obligation. \n (2) Operating income (loss) and Operating expense (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2016 were retrospectively recast to reflect the reclassification of the curtailment gain of $3.1 million from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to a newly defined line within Total other income (expense), net, Gain on curtailment of pension obligation. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other immaterial non-service-cost-related components of the net periodic benefit cost related to our defined benefit pension plan were reclassified from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to Other income (expense), net. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. \nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, acquisition and integration costs, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, debt extinguishment and commitment costs, release of tax valuation allowance, inventory valuation adjustment, severance costs, impairment expense, and (gain) loss on sale of assets. Beginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also excludes Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives and RINs loss in excess of net obligation (as defined in the Adjusted Gross Margin section above). The exclusion of Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives from Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is consistent with our treatment of Par's unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, which are also excluded from Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\nAdjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding interest expense and financing costs, taxes, DD&A, and, beginning in 2018, equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, excluding Par's share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform with the current period presentation.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:\n \u2022 The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and \n \u2022 Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,835\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RINs loss in excess of net obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,497\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,034\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt extinguishment and commitment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Release of tax valuation allowance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of common stock warrants\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,801\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,962\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,770\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation, depletion, and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and financing costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, LLC, excluding Par's share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,622\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (2) Included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense or (gain) loss on sale of assets. \nDiscussion of Operating Income by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $12.7 million compared to operating income of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. Another contributing factor was a decrease in RINs expense of approximately $18.5 million due primarily to our refineries obtaining a small refinery exemption for 2017 during the first quarter of 2018.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is relatively consistent with operating income of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $12.5 million compared to operating income of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 14% and an increase in sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $96.9 million compared to an operating loss of $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $28.8 million to the refining segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.6 million compared to operating income of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and higher transportation and logistics services revenue. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $6.0 million to the logistics segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.5 million compared to operating income of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 12% and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs and higher operating expenses.\nDiscussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $238.2 million, a decrease of $16.6 million compared to $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. Another contributing factor was a decrease in RINs expense of approximately $18.5 million due primarily to our refineries obtaining a small refinery exemption for 2017 during the first quarter of 2018.\nLogistics. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $48.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million compared to $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in barge revenues as a result of lower throughput volume and average prices per throughput barrel, partially offset by an increase in trucking volumes.\nRetail. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $107.4 million, an increase of $30.4 million compared to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in sales prices and higher sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $254.8 million, an increase of $115.7 million compared to $139.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $81.8 million and $23.7 million of Adjusted Gross Margin to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLogistics. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $55.2 million, an increase of $17.9 million compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and lower maintenance project costs at our Hawaii refinery. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $17.3 million and $5.1 million of Adjusted Gross Margin to the logistics segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRetail. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $77.0 million, an increase of $7.1 million compared to $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 12% in sales prices and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues were $3.4 billion, a $1.0 billion increase compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and volumes. Brent crude oil prices averaged $71.55 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Refined product sales volumes increased 11% from 90.7 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 100.3 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues in our retail segment increased $114.9 million primarily driven by the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nCost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation), was $3.0 billion, a $0.9 billion increase compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher crude oil prices and volumes as stated above. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) in our retail segment increased $84.6 million primarily driven by the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nOperating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $215.3 million, an increase of $13.3 million compared to $202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to operating expenses related to the Northwest Retail assets, which we acquired on March 23, 2018.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2018, DD&A expense was approximately $52.6 million, an increase of $6.6 million compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail on March 23, 2018 and approximately $4.1 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from changes in the estimated useful lives of certain refinery equipment, storage tanks, and leasehold improvements. Northwest Retail contributed $1.9 million of DD&A for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $47.4 million, which is relatively consistent with expense of $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $10.3 million of expenses primarily related to acquisition and integration costs for the Northwest Retail Acquisition, the Hawaii Refinery Expansion, and the Washington Refinery Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $0.4 million of integration costs related to the WRC Acquisition completed in July 2016. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nInterest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $39.8 million, an increase of $8.2 million compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to interest expense of $24.4 million related to the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes issued in December 2017 and increased financing costs of $2.4 million associated with J. Aron deferred payments, partially offset by lower interest expense of $17.4 million related to the debt and credit agreements terminated in December 2017 and a net increase on gains on interest rate derivatives of $0.9 million. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a gain of approximately $1.8 million, a change of $3.5 million compared to a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our stock price decreased from $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 to $14.18 per share as of December 31, 2018 which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share on December 31, 2017, which resulted in an increase in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the change in value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in a loss of $10.5 million as a result of the settlement agreement reached with Tesoro.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, there was no change in the value of our contingent consideration liability. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nDebt extinguishment and commitment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our debt extinguishment and commitment costs were approximately $4.2 million and represents the commitment and other fees associated with the financing of the Washington Refinery Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our debt extinguishment and commitment costs were approximately $8.6 million and represent early termination fees and the acceleration of deferred amortization costs in connection with the termination of the Delayed Draw Term Loan and Bridge Loan Credit Agreement ( Term Loan\u201d) during the second quarter of 2017 and the termination and repayment of our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEquity Losses From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $9.5 million, a change of $8.9 million compared to equity earnings of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to Laramie Energy's loss on derivative instruments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $35.5 million for the same period in 2017. The loss on derivative instruments was partially offset by a 42% increase in Laramie Energy's sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In addition, our ownership percentage decreased from 42.3% to 39.1% on February 28, 2018 due to an investment made by a third party and increased to 46.0% on October 18, 2018 due to Laramie Energy's repurchase of units from certain unitholders.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily due to deferred tax expense of $0.7 million offset by current federal income tax benefit of $0.3 million. Deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a benefit of $0.7 million related to the release of valuation allowance due to the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation on the interest deduction limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $2.4 billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. Brent crude oil prices averaged $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $45.14 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2016, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Wyoming Refining contributed revenues of $408.4 million and $168.6 million to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues in our retail segment increased $35.7 million primarily driven by an increase of 12% in sales prices.\nCost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation), was $2.1 billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.5 billion in third-party cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) at our refining segment which was primarily the result of the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and higher crude oil prices as discussed above. Wyoming Refining contributed cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) of $326.6 million and $145.9 million to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) in our retail segment increased $28.6 million primarily driven by 11% increase in fuel costs.\nOperating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $202.0 million, an increase of $32.6 million compared to $169.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining, which contributed $48.9 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2017, DD&A expense was approximately $46.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to DD&A related to assets acquired as part of the Wyoming Refining acquisition on July 14, 2016. Wyoming Refining contributed $15.5 million and $6.8 million of DD&A expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, amortization of deferred turnaround expenditures increased $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $46.1 million, an increase of $4.0 million compared to\n$42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs driven by increased headcount and severance costs incurred during the first quarter of 2017.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition and integration costs were approximately $0.4 million, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the WRC Acquisition in July 2016 compared to minor costs incurred in 2017 for the WRC integration and the pending Northwest Retail Acquisition.\nInterest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $31.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense and financing costs of $4.6 million related to the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities and Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the WRC Acquisition, higher interest expense of $5.0 million associated with our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued during the second quarter of 2016, and a $2.0 million reduction in the gain on interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense of $6.1 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and lower interest expense and financing costs of approximately $3.0 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Bridge Notes in the third quarter of 2016. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a loss of approximately $1.7 million, a change of $4.7 million when compared to a gain of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share as of December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our stock price decreased from $23.54 per share on December 31, 2015 to $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was no change in value of our contingent consideration liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the change in the value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in a gain of $10.8 million due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to PHR for 2016 as a result of lower crack spreads. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nDebt extinguishment and commitment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our debt extinguishment and commitment costs were approximately $8.6 million and represent early termination fees and the acceleration of deferred amortization costs in connection with the termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and the termination and repayment of our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017. No such costs were incurred in 2016.\nGain on curtailment of pension obligation. During December 2016, the benefit plan acquired as part of the WRC Acquisition was amended to freeze all future benefit accruals for salaried plan participants, resulting in a reduction of the projected benefit obligation of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. No amendments were made to the plan in 2017.\nEquity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2017, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $18.4 million, a change of $40.8 million compared to equity losses of $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to an increase in production volumes, natural gas prices, and an increase in our share of Laramie Energy's gain (loss) on derivative instruments of $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7.9 million primarily due to the release of $8.6 million of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with the reversal of the deferred tax liability recognized upon issuance of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes.\nConsolidating Condensed Financial Information\nOn December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC (the Issuer and Subsidiaries\u201d), issued its 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act.

Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs, and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements, and access to capital markets.\nOur liquidity position as of December 31, 2018 was $138.8 million and consisted of $109.4 million at Par Petroleum, LLC and subsidiaries, $29.1 million at Par Pacific Holdings, and $0.3 million at all our other subsidiaries. Our consolidated liquidity position as of February 27, 2019 was approximately $144.1 million. The change in our liquidity position from December 31, 2018 to February 27, 2019 was primarily attributable to the funding for and purchase of the Washington Refinery Acquisition, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the Washington Refinery Acquisition and the funding secured through a $250 million term loan facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (the \"GS Term Loan\") and a $45 million term loan with Bank of Hawaii (the \"Par Pacific Term Loan\").\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total liquidity of $138.8 million was comprised of a deferred payment arrangement with J. Aron, availability under or available borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and cash on hand of $75.1 million. In addition, we utilize the Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron to finance the majority of the inventory at our co-located Hawaii refinery and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, utilize an intermediation agreement with Merrill Lynch to procure feedstocks for our Washington refinery. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining and retail segments, payments related to acquisitions, to repay or refinance indebtedness, and cash capital contributions to Laramie Energy.\nWe believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. Additionally, we may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes or our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, our GS Term Loan and our Par Pacific Term Loan through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nRights Offering\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued approximately 4 million shares of our common stock to certain investors at a purchase price of $12.25 per share (the Rights Offering\u201d). The gross proceeds from the Rights Offering were approximately $49.9 million, before deducting expenses of approximately $0.9 million, for net proceeds of approximately $49.0 million. The net proceeds from the Rights Offering were used to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on our Bridge Notes.\nDebt Activity\nWe had the following significant debt issuances and amendments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n \u2022 On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. The December 5, 2018 amendment to the Supply and Offtake Agreements also (i) requires us to increase our margin requirements by an aggregate $2.5 million by making certain additional margin payments on December 19, 2018, March 1, 2019, and June 3, 2019, and (ii) only allows dividends, payments, or other distributions with respect to any equity interests in Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (\"PHR\") in limited and restricted circumstances. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2018, Mid Pac Petroleum, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Mid Pac Term Loan with American Savings Bank, FSB, which provided a term loan of up to approximately $1.5 million, the proceeds of which were received on and used for the October 18, 2018 purchase of retail property. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC and Par Petroleum Finance Corp., both our wholly owned subsidiaries, completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The net proceeds of $289.2 million (net of financing costs and original issue discount of 1%) from the sale were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2017, in connection with the issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Borrowers entered into the ABL Credit Facility dated as of December 21, 2017, with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility that provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit (the ABL Revolver\u201d). On July 24, 2018, we amended the ABL Credit Facility to increase the maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of the ABL Revolver by $10 million to $85 million, subject to a borrowing base. The ABL Revolver had no outstanding balance and had a borrowing base of approximately $54.7 million at December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 On June 30, 2017, we fully repaid and terminated the Term Loan. We recorded debt extinguishment costs of approximately $1.8 million related to unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan in the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, Par Wyoming Holdings, LLC, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement with certain lenders and Chambers Energy Management, LP, as agent, which provided for a single advance secured term loan to our subsidiary in the amount of $65.0 million (the Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan\u201d) at the closing of the WRC Acquisition. The proceeds of the Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the WRC Acquisition, to pay certain fees and closing costs, and for general corporate purposes. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, we assumed debt consisting of term loans of $58.0 million and revolving loans of $10.1 million under a Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of April 30, 2015 (as amended, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities\u201d), with Bank of America, N.A. The Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities also provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of $30.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, which provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, we issued approximately $52.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Notes in a private offering pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) entered into among the purchasers of the Bridge Notes and us. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes of $50.0 million were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the WRC Acquisition. On September 22, 2016, we used the net proceeds from the Rights Offering to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on the Bridge Notes. The remaining $3.1 million aggregate principal amount and $0.3 million unpaid interest of the Bridge Notes was mandatorily converted into 272,733 shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of $12.25 per share. \n \u2022 On June 21, 2016 and June 27, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes in a private placement under Rule 144A (the Convertible Notes Offering\u201d). The Convertible Notes Offering included the exercise in full of an option to purchase an additional $15 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes granted to the initial purchasers. The net proceeds of $111.6 million (net of original issue discount of 3%) from the sale of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes were used to finance a portion of the WRC Acquisition, to repay $5 million in principal amount of the Term Loan, and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 On December 17, 2015, HIE Retail, LLC (\"HIE Retail\") and Mid Pac entered into the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities in the form of a revolving credit facility up to $5.0 million ( Hawaii Retail Revolving Credit Facilities\u201d), which provided for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit and term loans ( Hawaii Retail Term Loans\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $110 million. The proceeds of the Hawaii Retail Term Loans were used to repay existing indebtedness under HIE Retail and Mid Pac's then existing credit agreements, to pay transaction fees and expenses, and to facilitate a cash distribution to us. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Hawaii Retail Revolving Credit Facilities. \n \u2022 As part of the May 8, 2017 amendment to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we also entered into a $30 million forward sale of certain monthly volumes of jet fuel to be delivered to J. Aron over the remaining amended term ( J. Aron Forward \nSale\u201d). The proceeds from the J. Aron Forward Sale were used to pay a portion of the outstanding balance on the Term Loan. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the J. Aron Forward Sale.\nPlease read Note 12-Debt and Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our debt agreements and the financing activities associated with the Washington Refinery Acquisition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(175,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286,243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>41,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which resulted from net income of approximately $39.4 million and non-cash charges to operations of approximately $61.7 million, offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $10.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $106.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which resulted from net income of approximately $72.6 million and non-cash charges to operations of approximately $50.1 million, offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $16.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted from a net loss of approximately $45.8 million and net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $19.2 million, offset by non-cash charges to operations of approximately $41.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $175.8 million and primarily related to $74.3 million for the Northwest Retail Acquisition, $53.9 million for the Hawaii Refinery Expansion, and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $48.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily related to additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $31.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily related to $209.2 million for the WRC Acquisition, an investment in Laramie Energy of $55.0 million, and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $24.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $41.9 million and consisted primarily of proceeds from net repayments of borrowings and net borrowings on our deferred payment arrangement of $27.3 million and the issuance of common stock totaling approximately $19.3 million, offset by the payment of $3.4 million in commitment and other fees related to the funding for the Washington Refinery Acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $4.8 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings and net payments on our deferred payment arrangement of $10.7 million, offset by deferred loan costs of $10.1 million and payments for early termination of financing agreements of $4.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $190.1 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings and net borrowings on our deferred payment arrangement of $160.5 million and the sale of common stock totaling approximately $49.0 million, offset by a contingent consideration settlement of $12.0 million and deferred loan costs of $6.9 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled approximately $48.4 million and were primarily related to the first phase of our diesel hydrotreater project at our Hawaii refinery and other capital projects and scheduled maintenance across our operating segments. Our capital expenditure budget for 2019 ranges from $100 to $110 million and primarily relates to the second phase of our diesel hydrotreater project to increase ultra-low sulfur distillate production capacity in our Hawaii refinery, the first phase of a project to allow for processing and storage of renewable fuels at our Washington refinery, equipment purchases and pre-engineering work in preparation for the 2020 turnarounds at our refineries, construction of the Tie-In connecting our SPM to the IES crude oil pipeline for Hawaii logistics, and scheduled maintenance and other expansion projects.\nWe also continue to seek strategic investments in business opportunities, but the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly related to our operating activities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Cash obligations reflected in the table below are not discounted.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (including current portion)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>538,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>537,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt (including Current Portion). Long-term debt includes the scheduled principal payments related to our outstanding debt obligations and letters of credit. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nInterest Payments on Debt. Interest payments on debt represent estimated periodic interest payment obligations associated with our outstanding debt obligations using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOperating Leases. Operating leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, office space, and office equipment leases. Also included in operating leases are terminal and charter agreements associated with our logistics operations.\nCapital Leases. Capital leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, vehicles, and information technology systems.\nPurchase Commitments. Purchase commitments primarily consist of contracts executed as of December 31, 2018 for the purchase of crude oil for use at our refineries that are scheduled for delivery in 2019.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nSupply and Offtake Agreements. On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron to support the operations of our Hawaii refinery (the Supply and Offtake Agreements\u201d). On May 8, 2017, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements and extended the term through May 31, 2021 with a one-year extension option upon mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply and Offtake Agreements were amended and restated on December 21, 2017 in connection with the issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the entry into the ABL Credit Facility. On June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Matters. Our operations and the third-party oil and gas exploration and production operations in which we have a working interest are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in the future as regulations and other conditions change.\nPeriodically, we receive communications from various federal, state, and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRegulation of Greenhouse Gases\nThe EPA has begun regulating GHG under the CAA. New construction or material expansions that meet certain GHG emissions thresholds will likely require that, among other things, a GHG permit be issued in accordance with the federal CAA regulations and we will be required in connection with such permitting to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce GHG emissions.\nFurthermore, the EPA is developing refinery-specific GHG regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose GHG emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations. Any such controls could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOn September 29, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule updating standards that control toxic air emissions from petroleum refineries, addressing, among other things, flaring operations, fenceline air quality monitoring, and additional emission reductions from storage tanks and delayed coking units. Compliance with this rule has not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows to date.\nIn 2007, the State of Hawaii passed Act 234, which required that GHG emissions be rolled back on a statewide basis to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although delayed, the Hawaii Department of Health has issued regulations that would require each major facility to reduce CO2 emissions by 16% by 2020 relative to a calendar year 2010 baseline (the first year in which GHG emissions were reported to the EPA under 40 CFR Part 98). Those rules are pending final approval by the Hawaii State Government. The capacity of our co-located refinery in Hawaii to reduce fuel use and GHG emissions is limited. However, the state's pending regulation allows, and we anticipate our co-located Hawaii refinery will be able to demonstrate, that additional reductions are not cost-effective or necessary in light of the state's current GHG inventory and future year projections. The pending regulation allows for partnering\u201d with other facilities (principally power plants) which have already dramatically reduced greenhouse emissions or are on schedule to reduce CO2 emissions in order to comply with the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards.\nFuel Standards\nIn 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act ( EISA\u201d) which, among other things, set a target fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contained an expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (the RFS2\u201d). In August 2012, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") jointly adopted regulations that establish an average industry fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025. On August 8, 2018, the EPA and NHTSA jointly proposed to revise existing fuel economy standards for model years 2021-2025 and to set standards for 2026 for the first time. The agencies have not yet issued a final rule, but they are expected to do so in 2019. Although the revised fuel economy standards are expected to be less stringent than the initial standards for model years 2021-2025, it is uncertain whether the revised standards will increase year over year. Higher fuel economy standards have the potential to reduce demand for our refined transportation fuel products.\nUnder EISA, the RFS2 requires an increasing amount of renewable fuel to be blended into the nation's transportation fuel supply, up to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. We, and other refiners subject to the RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers ( RINs\u201d), to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable fuels, we generate our own RINs for which we have the option of retaining the RINs for current or future RFS compliance or selling those RINs on the open market. The RFS2 may present production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels.\nIn October 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the federal CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10% ( E10\u201d) to 15% ( E15\u201d) for 2007 and newer light duty motor vehicles. In January 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model years 2001-2006. In 2019, EPA is expected\nto conduct a rulemaking to allow year-round sales of E15. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed on a large scale for use in traditional gasoline engines; however, increased renewable fuel in the nation's transportation fuel supply could reduce demand for our refined products.\nIn March 2014, the EPA published a final Tier 3 gasoline standard that requires, among other things, that gasoline contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) sulfur on an annual average basis and no more than 80 ppm sulfur on a per-gallon basis. The standard also lowers the allowable sulfur level in gasoline to 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) and also lowers the allowable benzene, aromatics, and olefins content of gasoline. The effective date for the new standard is January 1, 2017, however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020 to meet the standard. Our Hawaii refinery is required to comply with Tier 3 gasoline standards within 30 months of June 21, 2016, the date our Hawaii refinery was disqualified from small volume refinery status. On March 19, 2015, the EPA confirmed the small refinery status of our Wyoming refinery. The Par East facility of our Hawaii refinery, our Wyoming refinery, and our Washington refinery were all granted small refinery status by the EPA for 2017. The EPA is expected to make small refinery status determinations for 2018 in the first quarter of 2019.\nBeginning on June 30, 2014, new sulfur standards for fuel oil used by marine vessels operating within 200 miles of the U.S. coastline (which includes the entire Hawaiian Island chain) was lowered from 10,000 ppm (1%) to 1,000 ppm (0.1%). The sulfur standards began at the Hawaii refinery and were phased in so that by January 1, 2015, they were to be fully aligned with the International Marine Organization ( IMO\u201d) standards and deadline. The more stringent standards apply universally to both U.S. and foreign flagged ships. Although the marine fuel regulations provided vessel operators with a few compliance options such as installation of on-board pollution controls and demonstration unavailability, many vessel operators will be forced to switch to a distillate fuel while operating within the Emission Control Area ( ECA\u201d). Beyond the 200 mile ECA, large ocean vessels are still allowed to burn marine fuel with up to 3.5% sulfur. Our Hawaii refinery is capable of producing the 1% sulfur residual fuel oil that was previously required within the ECA. Although our Hawaii refinery remains in a position to supply vessels traveling to and through Hawaii, the market for 0.1% sulfur distillate fuel and 3.5% sulfur residual fuel is much more competitive.\nIn addition to U.S. fuels requirements, the IMO has also adopted newer standards that further reduce the global limit on sulfur content in maritime fuels to 0.5% beginning in 2020 (\"IMO 2020\"). Like the rest of the refining industry, we are focused on meeting these standards and may incur costs in producing lower-sulfur fuels.\nThere will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in the EISA, IMO 2020, and other fuel-related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.\nWyoming Refinery; Recent Acquisitions\nOur Wyoming refinery is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders, and settlement agreements involving the EPA and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. Our recent acquisition of Par East in Hawaii and the Washington refinery acquisition will also subject us to additional environmental compliance costs. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Agreement\nOn September 25, 2013, Par Petroleum, LLC, Tesoro, and PHR entered into an Environmental Agreement ( Environmental Agreement\u201d), which allocated responsibility for known and contingent environmental liabilities related to the acquisition of PHR, including the Consent Decree.

On June 17, 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of Par entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Tesoro, pursuant to which it purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in PHR. The PHR acquisition was subject to an earn-out provision during the years 2014-2016, subject to, among other things, an annual earn-out cap of $20 million. On March 22, 2018, Tesoro agreed to settle the earn-out dispute and release and discharge any related claims in exchange for our payment of $10.5 million.

We emerged from the reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation ( Delta\u201d) on August 31, 2012 ( Emergence Date\u201d) when the plan of reorganization ( Plan\u201d) was consummated. Please read Item 1. - Business - Bankruptcy and Plan of Reorganization\u201d of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperating Leases. We have various cancelable and noncancelable operating leases related to land, vehicles, office, and retail facilities and other facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. The majority of\nthe future lease payments relate to retail stations and facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. We have operating leases for most of our retail stations with an average term of 8 years remaining and generally containing renewal options and escalation clauses. Leases for facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products have various expiration dates extending to 2044.\nIn addition, within our corporate and other and logistics segments, we have various agreements to lease storage facilities, towboats, barges, and other equipment. These leasing agreements have been classified as operating leases for financial reporting purposes and the related rental fees are charged to expense over the lease term as they become payable. The leases generally range in duration of five years or less and contain lease renewal options at fair value.\nMinimum annual lease payments extending to 2044 for operating leases to which we are legally obligated and having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>62,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>39,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>38,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>38,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>191,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum rental payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>433,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Leases. We have capital lease obligations related primarily to the leases of 17 retail stations. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 15 years or more. Certain leases include escalation clauses and/or purchase options. Minimum annual lease payments including interest, for capital leases are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>2,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023\n</td> <td>1,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>2,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum lease payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less amount representing interest\n</td> <td>1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum rental payments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than our operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. We analyze our estimates on a periodic basis, including those related to fair value, impairments, natural gas and crude oil reserves, bad debts, natural gas and oil properties, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies, and litigation and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out accounting method. We value merchandise along with spare parts, materials, and supplies at average cost. Estimating the net realizable value of our inventory requires management to make assumptions about the timing of sales and the expected proceeds that will be realized for the sales.\nOur refining segment acquires all of its crude oil utilized at the Hawaii refinery from J. Aron under procurement contracts. The crude oil remains in the legal title of J. Aron and is stored in our storage tanks governed by a storage agreement. Legal title to the crude oil passes to us at the tank outlet. After processing, J. Aron takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until they are sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by J. Aron on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it. The valuation of our repurchase obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices and differentials assuming settlement at the end of the reporting period. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In estimating fair value, we use discounted cash flow projections, recent comparable market transactions, if available, or quoted prices. We consider assumptions that third parties would make in estimating fair value, including the highest and best use of the asset. The assumptions used by another party could differ significantly from our assumptions.\nWe classify fair value balances based on the classification of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of a transaction. The inputs used to measure fair value have been placed in a hierarchy based on priority. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted, readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Please read Note 14-Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. We obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. These valuation methods require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding characteristics of the acquired property and future revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would result in different amounts allocated to the related assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets\nWe assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. Under the quantitative test, we compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies within our industry. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\nWe review property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying value. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined using the income approach.\nDerivatives and Other Financial instruments\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to crude oil and refined products. We manage this exposure through the use of various derivative commodity instruments. These instruments include exchange traded futures and over-the-counter swaps,\nforwards, and options.\nFor our forward contracts that are derivatives, we have elected the normal purchase normal sale exclusion, as it is our policy to fulfill or accept the physical delivery of the product and we will not net settle. Therefore, we did not recognize the unrealized gains or losses related to these contracts in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the accrual method of accounting to contracts qualifying for the normal purchase and sale exemption.\nAll derivative instruments not designated as normal purchases or sales are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. We have not designated any derivative instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges and, therefore, do not apply hedge accounting treatment.\nIn addition, we may have other financial instruments, such as warrants or embedded debt features, that may be classified as liabilities when either (a) the holders possess rights to net cash settlement, (b) physical or net equity settlement is not in our control, or (c) the instruments contain other provisions that cause us to conclude that they are not indexed to our equity. We have accounted for our obligation to repurchase crude oil and refined products from J.Aron at the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements as an embedded derivative. Additionally, we have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium on our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes represent an embedded derivative. These liabilities were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through earnings.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record asset retirement obligations ( AROs\u201d) at fair value in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by government action or contractual arrangement, to incur these costs and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. Our AROs arise from our refining, retail, and logistics operations, as well as plugging and abandonment of wells within our natural gas and crude oil operations. AROs are calculated based on the present value of the estimated removal and other closure costs using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Both expenses are recorded in Depreciation, depletion, and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the settlement amount and the recorded liability is recorded as a gain or loss on asset disposals in our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate settlement dates by considering our past practice, industry practice, management's intent, and estimated economic lives.\nWe cannot currently estimate the fair value for certain AROs primarily because we cannot estimate settlement dates (or ranges of dates) associated with these assets. These AROs include hazardous materials disposal (such as petroleum manufacturing by-products, chemical catalysts, and sealed insulation material containing asbestos) and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of our refining facilities, terminal facilities, or pipelines, including the demolition or removal of certain major processing units, buildings, tanks, pipelines, or other equipment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carry forwards. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly based on a more likely than not\u201d standard and, to the extent this threshold is not met, a valuation allowance is recorded. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future results of operations, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nBased upon the level of historical taxable income, significant book losses during the prior periods, and projections for future results of operations over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, among other factors, management concluded that we did not meet the more likely than not\u201d requirement in order to recognize deferred tax assets and therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life or increase the capacity of facilities as well as expenditures that prevent environmental contamination. We expense costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that\ndo not contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Cost estimates are based on the expected timing and extent of remedial actions required by governing agencies, experience gained from similar sites for which environmental assessments or remediation have been completed, and the amount of our anticipated liability considering the proportional liability and financial abilities of other responsible parties. Usually, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. Estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value and are presented within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Environmental expenses are recorded in Operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nWe are a growth-oriented company based in Houston, Texas, that owns and operates market-leading energy and infrastructure businesses. For more information, please read Part I -Item 1. - Business-Overview\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRecent Events Affecting Comparability of Periods\nHawaii Refinery Expansion\nOn December 19, 2018, we completed the Hawaii Refinery Expansion for approximately $66.9 million, net of a $4.3 million receivable related to net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consisted of $47.6 million in cash and approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $19.3 million. The results of operations of the newly acquired assets are included in our refining segment commencing December 19, 2018.\nNorthwest Retail Acquisition\nOn January 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CHS, Inc. to acquire 33 retail outlets at various locations in Washington and Idaho. On March 23, 2018, we completed the Northwest Retail Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $74.5 million. As part of the Northwest Retail Acquisition, Par and CHS, Inc. entered into a multi-year branded petroleum marketing agreement for the continued supply of Cenex\u00ae-branded refined products to the 33 acquired Cenex\u00ae Zip Trip retail outlets.The results of operations of Northwest Retail are included in our retail segment commencing March 23, 2018. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nAmended and Restated J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements\nOn June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. Prior to June 27, 2018, we had the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $125 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Effective June 27, 2018, we have the right to defer payments owed to J. Aron up to the lesser of $165 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. On December 5, 2018, we amended and restated the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Prior Periods\nWe completed the WRC Acquisition on July 14, 2016, for cash consideration of $209.4 million, including a deposit of $5.0 million paid in June 2016 and assumed debt consisting of term loans of $58.0 million and revolving loans of $10.1 million. The results of operations of WRC are included in our segments effective July 14, 2016. Please read Note 4-Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 11, 2019, we completed the Washington Refinery Acquisition for total consideration of $326.7 million, including acquired working capital, consisting of cash consideration of $289.7 million and approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock issued to the seller of U.S. Oil. The Washington refinery's results of operations will be included in our refining and logistics segments commencing January 11, 2019. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Income (Loss). Our net income decreased from $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to net income of $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in our net income was primarily driven by lower refining margins, a $10.5 million charge related to the Tesoro earn-out settlement, higher acquisition and integration costs, and a decrease in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment. Other factors impacting our results period over period include increased interest expense and financing fees, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization ( DD&A\u201d).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $132.1 million compared to $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to lower refining margins driven by unfavorable crude differentials, partially offset by improved margins in our retail segment and an increase in refined product sales volumes and crack spreads.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was approximately $49.3 million compared to approximately $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily related to the same factors described above for the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, increased interest expense and financing fees, and DD&A.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet Income (Loss). During 2017, our financial performance was primarily driven by improved crack spreads, which was reflected in a change in our net income (loss) from a net loss of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to net income of $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other factors impacting our results period over period include the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC, partially offset by debt extinguishment and commitment costs and the change in value of the contingent consideration obligation during 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $140.8 million compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads and the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was income of approximately $63.3 million compared to a loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads, the full-year contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, and an improvement in our Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy excluding our share of Laramie's unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by an increase in Interest expense and financing costs, net.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands). The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following tables summarize our operating income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands). The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Our logistics operations consist primarily of intercompany transactions which eliminate on a consolidated basis. \n (2) Includes eliminations of intersegment Revenues and Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) of $365.5 million, $325.2 million, and $271.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. \nBelow is a summary of key operating statistics for the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Feedstocks throughput and sales volumes per day for the Wyoming refinery for 2016 are calculated based on the 171 day period for which we owned Wyoming Refining in 2016. As such, the amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the year plus the Wyoming refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the period from July 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The 2017 and 2018 amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming refineries' throughput or sales volumes averaged over the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. \n (2) The profitability of our Hawaii business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in the Singapore market. This market reflects the closest liquid market alternative to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the 4-1-2-1 Singapore crack spread (or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel), and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflects a market indicator for our Hawaii refinery operations. The previously reported 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread was calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indexes. We have revised key operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we have also excluded the Mid Pacific Crude Oil Differential from our key operating statistics as we believe this metric no longer provides a consistent and reasonable market indicator for crude purchases differentials given the unique geographical locations of our Hawaii business and the variability of our crude slate. \n (3) Please see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput. \n (4) Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations. \n (5) The profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the best market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillate (ULSD) as created from three barrels of WTI. Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota, and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado. \n (6) Operating income per bbl and Production costs per bbl for the Wyoming refinery for the year ended December 31, 2016 were retrospectively recast to reflect the reclassification of the curtailment gain of $3.1 million related to an amendment of our defined benefit pension plan from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to a newly-defined line within Total other income (expense), net, Gain on curtailment of pension obligation. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting \nPolicies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nBelow is a summary of key operating statistics for the retail and logistics segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Retail sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes 284 days of retail sales volumes from Northwest Retail since its acquisition on March 23, 2018. \n (2) The 2016 amounts for the total logistics segment represent the sum of the pipeline throughput in Hawaii averaged over the year plus the pipeline throughput in Wyoming averaged over the period from July 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The 2017 and 2018 amounts for the total logistics segment represent the sum of the Hawaii and Wyoming pipelines' throughput averaged over the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. \nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), DD&A, RINs loss in excess of net obligation (see definition below), and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) plus inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized losses (gains) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINs obligations, and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes certain direct operating expenses related to our logistics segment, unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nBeginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes RINs losses recorded in excess of our net RINs obligation ( RINs loss in excess of net obligation\u201d). Our RINs obligations to comply with RFS are recorded as liabilities and measured at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our RINs assets, which include RINS purchased in on the open market and RINs generated by blending biofuels as part of our refining process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (\"NRV\") as of the end of the reporting period. During periods of rising RINs market prices, we recognize unrealized losses associated with the increase in the fair value of our RINs liabilities. We do not adjust the carrying value of our RINs assets because such assets are stated at the lower of cost or NRV under GAAP. This adjustment represents the income statement effect of reflecting our RINs liability on a net basis, as the settlement of any open obligation would first be offset by RINs assets rather than purchasing such RINs obligations at market prices. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform to the current period presentation.\nManagement believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing\nagreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.\nAdjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n\n\n________________________________________\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense. For the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, there was no RINs loss in excess of net obligation. \n (2) Operating income (loss) and Operating expense (excluding depreciation) for the year ended December 31, 2016 were retrospectively recast to reflect the reclassification of the curtailment gain of $3.1 million from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to a newly defined line within Total other income (expense), net, Gain on curtailment of pension obligation. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other immaterial non-service-cost-related components of the net periodic benefit cost related to our defined benefit pension plan were reclassified from Operating expense (excluding depreciation) to Other income (expense), net. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. \nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, acquisition and integration costs, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, debt extinguishment and commitment costs, release of tax valuation allowance, inventory valuation adjustment, severance costs, impairment expense, and (gain) loss on sale of assets. Beginning in 2018, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also excludes Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives and RINs loss in excess of net obligation (as defined in the Adjusted Gross Margin section above). The exclusion of Par's share of Laramie Energy's unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives from Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is consistent with our treatment of Par's unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, which are also excluded from Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\nAdjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding interest expense and financing costs, taxes, DD&A, and, beginning in 2018, equity losses (earnings) from Laramie Energy, excluding Par's share of unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives. We have recast the non-GAAP information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to conform with the current period presentation.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:\n \u2022 The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; \n \u2022 The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and \n \u2022 Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (2) Included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense or (gain) loss on sale of assets. \nDiscussion of Operating Income by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $12.7 million compared to operating income of $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. Another contributing factor was a decrease in RINs expense of approximately $18.5 million due primarily to our refineries obtaining a small refinery exemption for 2017 during the first quarter of 2018.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is relatively consistent with operating income of $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $12.5 million compared to operating income of $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 14% and an increase in sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. Operating income for our refining segment was $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $96.9 million compared to an operating loss of $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $28.8 million to the refining segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLogistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.6 million compared to operating income of $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and higher transportation and logistics services revenue. Wyoming Refining contributed operating income of approximately $6.0 million to the logistics segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRetail. Operating income for our retail segment was $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.5 million compared to operating income of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in sales prices of 12% and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs and higher operating expenses.\nDiscussion of Adjusted Gross Margin by Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $238.2 million, a decrease of $16.6 million compared to $254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii partially offset by improved crack spreads. Feedstock costs at the Hawaii refinery increased approximately 29% due to unfavorable crude differentials and increased refined product purchases to meet higher on-island demand and contractual obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a 12% increase in Hawaii refinery sales volumes and improved crack spreads in Hawaii and Wyoming. The Singapore crack spread increased 1% from $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.22 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Wyoming Index increased 4% from $21.80 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $22.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $48.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million compared to $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in barge revenues as a result of lower throughput volume and average prices per throughput barrel, partially offset by an increase in trucking volumes.\nRetail. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $107.4 million, an increase of $30.4 million compared to $77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in sales prices and higher sales volumes of 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRefining. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $254.8 million, an increase of $115.7 million compared to $139.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher crack spreads and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. The Singapore crack spread increased 92% from $3.74 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.18 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $81.8 million and $23.7 million of Adjusted Gross Margin to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLogistics. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $55.2 million, an increase of $17.9 million compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining and lower maintenance project costs at our Hawaii refinery.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $77.0 million, an increase of $7.1 million compared to $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 12% in sales prices and an increase in sales volumes of 2%, partially offset by a 11% increase in fuel costs.\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues were $3.4 billion, a $1.0 billion increase compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and volumes. Brent crude oil prices averaged $71.55 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Refined product sales volumes increased 11% from 90.7 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 100.3 Mbpd in the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues in our retail segment increased $114.9 million primarily driven by the acquisition of Northwest Retail.\nCost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation), was $3.0 billion, a $0.9 billion increase compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $215.3 million, an increase of $13.3 million compared to $202.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to operating expenses related to the Northwest Retail assets, which we acquired on March 23, 2018.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2018, DD&A expense was approximately $52.6 million, an increase of $6.6 million compared to $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Northwest Retail on March 23, 2018 and approximately $4.1 million of accelerated depreciation resulting from changes in the estimated useful lives of certain refinery equipment, storage tanks, and leasehold improvements. Northwest Retail contributed $1.9 million of DD&A for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $47.4 million, which is relatively consistent with expense of $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs.

The increase was primarily due to interest expense of $24.4 million related to the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes issued in December 2017 and increased financing costs of $2.4 million associated with J. Aron deferred payments, partially offset by lower interest expense of $17.4 million related to the debt and credit agreements terminated in December 2017 and a net increase on gains on interest rate derivatives of $0.9 million. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a gain of approximately $1.8 million, a change of $3.5 million compared to a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our stock price decreased from $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 to $14.18 per share as of December 31, 2018 which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share on December 31, 2017, which resulted in an increase in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration.

Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEquity Losses From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $9.5 million, a change of $8.9 million compared to equity earnings of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to Laramie Energy's loss on derivative instruments of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $35.5 million for the same period in 2017. The loss on derivative instruments was partially offset by a 42% increase in Laramie Energy's sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In addition, our ownership percentage decreased from 42.3% to 39.1% on February 28, 2018 due to an investment made by a third party and increased to 46.0% on October 18, 2018 due to Laramie Energy's repurchase of units from certain unitholders.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily due to deferred tax expense of $0.7 million offset by current federal income tax benefit of $0.3 million. Deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a benefit of $0.7 million related to the release of valuation allowance due to the impact of the U.S. tax reform legislation on the interest deduction limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $2.4 billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 billion in third-party revenues at our refining segment, which was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices and the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining. Brent crude oil prices averaged $54.82 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $45.14 per barrel in the year ended December 31, 2016, with similar increases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Wyoming Refining contributed revenues of $408.4 million and $168.6 million to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues in our retail segment increased $35.7 million primarily driven by an increase of 12% in sales prices.\nCost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation), was $2.1 billion, a $0.5 billion increase compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Wyoming Refining contributed cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) of $326.6 million and $145.9 million to the refining segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) in our retail segment increased $28.6 million primarily driven by 11% increase in fuel costs.\nOperating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately $202.0 million, an increase of $32.6 million compared to $169.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the full year contribution of Wyoming Refining, which contributed $48.9 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDepreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2017, DD&A expense was approximately $46.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to DD&A related to assets acquired as part of the Wyoming Refining acquisition on July 14, 2016. Wyoming Refining contributed $15.5 million and $6.8 million of DD&A expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The increase is primarily due to higher payroll and employee benefit costs driven by increased headcount and severance costs incurred during the first quarter of 2017.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, acquisition and integration costs were approximately $0.4 million, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the WRC Acquisition in July 2016 compared to minor costs incurred in 2017 for the WRC integration and the pending Northwest Retail Acquisition.\nInterest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $31.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense and financing costs of $4.6 million related to the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities and Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the WRC Acquisition, higher interest expense of $5.0 million associated with our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued during the second quarter of 2016, and a $2.0 million reduction in the gain on interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense of $6.1 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and lower interest expense and financing costs of approximately $3.0 million due to the full repayment and termination of the Bridge Notes in the third quarter of 2016. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our indebtedness.\nChange in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a loss of approximately $1.7 million, a change of $4.7 million when compared to a gain of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price increased from $14.54 per share as of December 31, 2016 to $19.28 per share as of December 31, 2017 which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our stock price decreased from $23.54 per share on December 31, 2015 to $14.54 per share on December 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in the value of the common stock warrants.\nChange in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was no change in value of our contingent consideration liability. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the change in the value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in a gain of $10.8 million due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to PHR for 2016 as a result of lower crack spreads. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nDebt extinguishment and commitment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our debt extinguishment and commitment costs were approximately $8.6 million and represent early termination fees and the acceleration of deferred amortization costs in connection with the termination of the Term Loan during the second quarter of 2017 and the termination and repayment of our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale in the fourth quarter of 2017. No such costs were incurred in 2016.\nGain on curtailment of pension obligation. During December 2016, the benefit plan acquired as part of the WRC Acquisition was amended to freeze all future benefit accruals for salaried plan participants, resulting in a reduction of the projected benefit obligation of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Please read Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17-Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. No amendments were made to the plan in 2017.\nEquity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2017, equity earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $18.4 million, a change of $40.8 million compared to equity losses of $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to an increase in production volumes, natural gas prices, and an increase in our share of Laramie Energy's gain (loss) on derivative instruments of $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nIncome Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million primarily due to the release of $0.8 million of valuation allowance associated with the U.S. tax reform legislation that converted the Alternative Minimum Tax Credit Carryovers to refundable credits. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7.9 million primarily due to the release of $8.6 million of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with the reversal of the deferred tax liability recognized upon issuance of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes.\nConsolidating Condensed Financial Information\nOn December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC (the Issuer and Subsidiaries\u201d), issued its 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The notes were co-issued by Par Petroleum Finance Corp., which has no independent assets or operations. The notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis only as to payment of principal and interest by Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (the Parent\u201d) and are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of the subsidiaries of Par Petroleum, LLC (other than Par Petroleum Finance Corp.).\nThe following supplemental condensed consolidating financial information reflects (i) the Parent's separate accounts, (ii) Par Petroleum, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries' accounts (which are all guarantors of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes), (iii) the accounts of subsidiaries of the Parent that are not guarantors of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and consolidating adjustments and eliminations, and (iv) the Parent's consolidated accounts for the dates and periods indicated. For purposes of the following condensed consolidating information, the Parent's investment in its subsidiaries is accounted for under the equity method of accounting (dollar amounts in thousands).\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA for the supplemental consolidating condensed financial information, which is segregated at the Parent Guarantor,\u201d Issuer and Subsidiaries,\u201d and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and Eliminations\u201d levels, is calculated in the same manner as for the Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. Adjusted EBITDA calculations. See Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Performance Measures - Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d above.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), on a historical basis for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________\n (1) Included in Income tax benefit on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (2) Included in Equity earnings (losses) from Laramie Energy, LLC on our consolidated statements of operations. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there was no impairment expense or (gain) loss on sale of assets. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements, fixed capacity payments and contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs, and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements, and access to capital markets.\nOur liquidity position as of December 31, 2018 was $138.8 million and consisted of $109.4 million at Par Petroleum, LLC and subsidiaries, $29.1 million at Par Pacific Holdings, and $0.3 million at all our other subsidiaries. Our consolidated liquidity position as of February 27, 2019 was approximately $144.1 million. The change in our liquidity position from December 31, 2018 to February 27, 2019 was primarily attributable to the funding for and purchase of the Washington Refinery Acquisition, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. Please read Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the Washington Refinery Acquisition and the funding secured through a $250 million term loan facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (the \"GS Term Loan\") and a $45 million term loan with Bank of Hawaii (the \"Par Pacific Term Loan\").\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total liquidity of $138.8 million was comprised of a deferred payment arrangement with J. Aron, availability under or available borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and cash on hand of $75.1 million. In addition, we utilize the Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron to finance the majority of the inventory at our co-located Hawaii refinery and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, utilize an intermediation agreement with Merrill Lynch to procure feedstocks for our Washington refinery. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining and retail segments, payments related to acquisitions, to repay or refinance indebtedness, and cash capital contributions to Laramie Energy.\nWe believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. Additionally, we may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes or our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and, following the Washington Refinery Acquisition in January 2019, our GS Term Loan and our Par Pacific Term Loan through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nRights Offering\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued approximately 4 million shares of our common stock to certain investors at a purchase price of $12.25 per share (the Rights Offering\u201d). The gross proceeds from the Rights Offering were approximately $49.9 million, before deducting expenses of approximately $0.9 million, for net proceeds of approximately $49.0 million. The net proceeds from the Rights Offering were used to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on our Bridge Notes.\nDebt Activity\nWe had the following significant debt issuances and amendments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n \u2022 On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. The December 5, 2018 amendment to the Supply and Offtake Agreements also (i) requires us to increase our margin requirements by an aggregate $2.5 million by making certain additional margin payments on December 19, 2018, March 1, 2019, and June 3, 2019, and (ii) only allows dividends, payments, or other distributions with respect to any equity interests in Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (\"PHR\") in limited and restricted circumstances. \n \u2022 On September 27, 2018, Mid Pac Petroleum, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Mid Pac Term Loan with American Savings Bank, FSB, which provided a term loan of up to approximately $1.5 million, the proceeds of which were received on and used for the October 18, 2018 purchase of retail property. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2017, Par Petroleum, LLC and Par Petroleum Finance Corp., both our wholly owned subsidiaries, completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act. The net proceeds of $289.2 million (net of financing costs and original issue discount of 1%) from the sale were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities, the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement, and the J. Aron Forward Sale and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 On December 21, 2017, in connection with the issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Borrowers entered into the ABL Credit Facility dated as of December 21, 2017, with certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility that provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit (the ABL Revolver\u201d). On July 24, 2018, we amended the ABL Credit Facility to increase the maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of the ABL Revolver by $10 million to $85 million, subject to a borrowing base. The ABL Revolver had no outstanding balance and had a borrowing base of approximately $54.7 million at December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 On June 30, 2017, we fully repaid and terminated the Term Loan. We recorded debt extinguishment costs of approximately $1.8 million related to unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Term Loan in the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, Par Wyoming Holdings, LLC, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement with certain lenders and Chambers Energy Management, LP, as agent, which provided for a single advance secured term loan to our subsidiary in the amount of $65.0 million (the Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan\u201d) at the closing of the WRC Acquisition. The proceeds of the Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the WRC Acquisition, to pay certain fees and closing costs, and for general corporate purposes. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, in connection with the WRC Acquisition, we assumed debt consisting of term loans of $58.0 million and revolving loans of $10.1 million under a Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of April 30, 2015 (as amended, the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities\u201d), with Bank of America, N.A. The Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities also provided for a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of $30.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, which provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities. \n \u2022 On July 14, 2016, we issued approximately $52.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Notes in a private offering pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) entered into among the purchasers of the Bridge Notes and us. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes of $50.0 million were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the WRC Acquisition. On September 22, 2016, we used the net proceeds from the Rights Offering to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on the Bridge Notes. The remaining $3.1 million aggregate principal amount and $0.3 million unpaid interest of the Bridge Notes was mandatorily converted into 272,733 shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of $12.25 per share. \n \u2022 On June 21, 2016 and June 27, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes in a private placement under Rule 144A (the Convertible Notes Offering\u201d). The Convertible Notes Offering included the exercise in full of an option to purchase an additional $15 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes granted to the initial purchasers. The net proceeds of $111.6 million (net of original issue discount of 3%) from the sale of the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes were used to finance a portion of the WRC Acquisition, to repay $5 million in principal amount of the Term Loan, and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 On December 17, 2015, HIE Retail, LLC (\"HIE Retail\") and Mid Pac entered into the Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities in the form of a revolving credit facility up to $5.0 million ( Hawaii Retail Revolving Credit Facilities\u201d), which provided for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit and term loans ( Hawaii Retail Term Loans\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $110 million. The proceeds of the Hawaii Retail Term Loans were used to repay existing indebtedness under HIE Retail and Mid Pac's then existing credit agreements, to pay transaction fees and expenses, and to facilitate a cash distribution to us. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the Hawaii Retail Revolving Credit Facilities. \n \u2022 As part of the May 8, 2017 amendment to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we also entered into a $30 million forward sale of certain monthly volumes of jet fuel to be delivered to J. Aron over the remaining amended term ( J. Aron Forward \nSale\u201d). The proceeds from the J. Aron Forward Sale were used to pay a portion of the outstanding balance on the Term Loan. Upon issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes on December 21, 2017, we repaid in full and terminated the J. Aron Forward Sale.\nPlease read Note 12-Debt and Note 22-Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our debt agreements and the financing activities associated with the Washington Refinery Acquisition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $90.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which resulted from net income of approximately $39.4 million and non-cash charges to operations of approximately $61.7 million, offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $10.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $106.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which resulted from net income of approximately $72.6 million and non-cash charges to operations of approximately $50.1 million, offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $16.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted from a net loss of approximately $45.8 million and net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $19.2 million, offset by non-cash charges to operations of approximately $41.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $175.8 million and primarily related to $74.3 million for the Northwest Retail Acquisition, $53.9 million for the Hawaii Refinery Expansion, and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $48.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and was primarily related to additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $31.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily related to $209.2 million for the WRC Acquisition, an investment in Laramie Energy of $55.0 million, and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $24.8 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $41.9 million and consisted primarily of proceeds from net repayments of borrowings and net borrowings on our deferred payment arrangement of $27.3 million and the issuance of common stock totaling approximately $19.3 million, offset by the payment of $3.4 million in commitment and other fees related to the funding for the Washington Refinery Acquisition. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $4.8 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings and net payments on our deferred payment arrangement of $10.7 million, offset by deferred loan costs of $10.1 million and payments for early termination of financing agreements of $4.4 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately $190.1 million consisted primarily of proceeds from net borrowings and net borrowings on our deferred payment arrangement of $160.5 million and the sale of common stock totaling approximately $49.0 million, offset by a contingent consideration settlement of $12.0 million and deferred loan costs of $6.9 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled approximately $48.4 million and were primarily related to the first phase of our diesel hydrotreater project at our Hawaii refinery and other capital projects and scheduled maintenance across our operating segments. Our capital expenditure budget for 2019 ranges from $100 to $110 million and primarily relates to the second phase of our diesel hydrotreater project to increase ultra-low sulfur distillate production capacity in our Hawaii refinery, the first phase of a project to allow for processing and storage of renewable fuels at our Washington refinery, equipment purchases and pre-engineering work in preparation for the 2020 turnarounds at our refineries, construction of the Tie-In connecting our SPM to the IES crude oil pipeline for Hawaii logistics, and scheduled maintenance and other expansion projects.\nWe also continue to seek strategic investments in business opportunities, but the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly related to our operating activities. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Cash obligations reflected in the table below are not discounted.\n\nLong-Term Debt (including Current Portion). Long-term debt includes the scheduled principal payments related to our outstanding debt obligations and letters of credit. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nInterest Payments on Debt. Interest payments on debt represent estimated periodic interest payment obligations associated with our outstanding debt obligations using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. Please read Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nOperating Leases. Operating leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, office space, and office equipment leases. Also included in operating leases are terminal and charter agreements associated with our logistics operations.\nCapital Leases. Capital leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, vehicles, and information technology systems.\nPurchase Commitments. Purchase commitments primarily consist of contracts executed as of December 31, 2018 for the purchase of crude oil for use at our refineries that are scheduled for delivery in 2019.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nSupply and Offtake Agreements. On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron to support the operations of our Hawaii refinery (the Supply and Offtake Agreements\u201d). On May 8, 2017, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements and extended the term through May 31, 2021 with a one-year extension option upon mutual agreement of the parties. The Supply and Offtake Agreements were amended and restated on December 21, 2017 in connection with the issuance of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the entry into the ABL Credit Facility. On June 27, 2018, we and J. Aron amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to increase the amount that we may defer under the deferred payment arrangement. On December 5, 2018, we amended the Supply and Offtake Agreements to account for additional processing capacity expected to be provided through the Hawaii Refinery Expansion. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Matters. Our operations and the third-party oil and gas exploration and production operations in which we have a working interest are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in the future as regulations and other conditions change.\nPeriodically, we receive communications from various federal, state, and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRegulation of Greenhouse Gases\nThe EPA has begun regulating GHG under the CAA. New construction or material expansions that meet certain GHG emissions thresholds will likely require that, among other things, a GHG permit be issued in accordance with the federal CAA regulations and we will be required in connection with such permitting to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce GHG emissions.\nFurthermore, the EPA is developing refinery-specific GHG regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose GHG emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations. Any such controls could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOn September 29, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule updating standards that control toxic air emissions from petroleum refineries, addressing, among other things, flaring operations, fenceline air quality monitoring, and additional emission reductions from storage tanks and delayed coking units. Compliance with this rule has not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows to date.\nIn 2007, the State of Hawaii passed Act 234, which required that GHG emissions be rolled back on a statewide basis to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although delayed, the Hawaii Department of Health has issued regulations that would require each major facility to reduce CO2 emissions by 16% by 2020 relative to a calendar year 2010 baseline (the first year in which GHG emissions were reported to the EPA under 40 CFR Part 98). Those rules are pending final approval by the Hawaii State Government. The capacity of our co-located refinery in Hawaii to reduce fuel use and GHG emissions is limited. However, the state's pending regulation allows, and we anticipate our co-located Hawaii refinery will be able to demonstrate, that additional reductions are not cost-effective or necessary in light of the state's current GHG inventory and future year projections. The pending regulation allows for partnering\u201d with other facilities (principally power plants) which have already dramatically reduced greenhouse emissions or are on schedule to reduce CO2 emissions in order to comply with the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards.\nFuel Standards\nIn 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act ( EISA\u201d) which, among other things, set a target fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contained an expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (the RFS2\u201d). In August 2012, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") jointly adopted regulations that establish an average industry fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025. On August 8, 2018, the EPA and NHTSA jointly proposed to revise existing fuel economy standards for model years 2021-2025 and to set standards for 2026 for the first time. The agencies have not yet issued a final rule, but they are expected to do so in 2019. Although the revised fuel economy standards are expected to be less stringent than the initial standards for model years 2021-2025, it is uncertain whether the revised standards will increase year over year. Higher fuel economy standards have the potential to reduce demand for our refined transportation fuel products.\nUnder EISA, the RFS2 requires an increasing amount of renewable fuel to be blended into the nation's transportation fuel supply, up to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. We, and other refiners subject to the RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers ( RINs\u201d), to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable fuels, we generate our own RINs for which we have the option of retaining the RINs for current or future RFS compliance or selling those RINs on the open market. The RFS2 may present production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels.\nIn October 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the federal CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10% ( E10\u201d) to 15% ( E15\u201d) for 2007 and newer light duty motor vehicles. In January 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model years 2001-2006. In 2019, EPA is expected\nto conduct a rulemaking to allow year-round sales of E15. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed on a large scale for use in traditional gasoline engines; however, increased renewable fuel in the nation's transportation fuel supply could reduce demand for our refined products.\nIn March 2014, the EPA published a final Tier 3 gasoline standard that requires, among other things, that gasoline contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) sulfur on an annual average basis and no more than 80 ppm sulfur on a per-gallon basis. The standard also lowers the allowable sulfur level in gasoline to 10 parts per million ( ppm\u201d) and also lowers the allowable benzene, aromatics, and olefins content of gasoline. The effective date for the new standard is January 1, 2017, however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020 to meet the standard. Our Hawaii refinery is required to comply with Tier 3 gasoline standards within 30 months of June 21, 2016, the date our Hawaii refinery was disqualified from small volume refinery status. On March 19, 2015, the EPA confirmed the small refinery status of our Wyoming refinery. The Par East facility of our Hawaii refinery, our Wyoming refinery, and our Washington refinery were all granted small refinery status by the EPA for 2017. The EPA is expected to make small refinery status determinations for 2018 in the first quarter of 2019.\nBeginning on June 30, 2014, new sulfur standards for fuel oil used by marine vessels operating within 200 miles of the U.S. coastline (which includes the entire Hawaiian Island chain) was lowered from 10,000 ppm (1%) to 1,000 ppm (0.1%). The sulfur standards began at the Hawaii refinery and were phased in so that by January 1, 2015, they were to be fully aligned with the International Marine Organization ( IMO\u201d) standards and deadline. The more stringent standards apply universally to both U.S. and foreign flagged ships. Although the marine fuel regulations provided vessel operators with a few compliance options such as installation of on-board pollution controls and demonstration unavailability, many vessel operators will be forced to switch to a distillate fuel while operating within the Emission Control Area ( ECA\u201d). Beyond the 200 mile ECA, large ocean vessels are still allowed to burn marine fuel with up to 3.5% sulfur. Our Hawaii refinery is capable of producing the 1% sulfur residual fuel oil that was previously required within the ECA. Although our Hawaii refinery remains in a position to supply vessels traveling to and through Hawaii, the market for 0.1% sulfur distillate fuel and 3.5% sulfur residual fuel is much more competitive.\nIn addition to U.S. fuels requirements, the IMO has also adopted newer standards that further reduce the global limit on sulfur content in maritime fuels to 0.5% beginning in 2020 (\"IMO 2020\"). Like the rest of the refining industry, we are focused on meeting these standards and may incur costs in producing lower-sulfur fuels.\nThere will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in the EISA, IMO 2020, and other fuel-related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.\nWyoming Refinery; Recent Acquisitions\nOur Wyoming refinery is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders, and settlement agreements involving the EPA and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. Our recent acquisition of Par East in Hawaii and the Washington refinery acquisition will also subject us to additional environmental compliance costs. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nEnvironmental Agreement\nOn September 25, 2013, Par Petroleum, LLC, Tesoro, and PHR entered into an Environmental Agreement ( Environmental Agreement\u201d), which allocated responsibility for known and contingent environmental liabilities related to the acquisition of PHR, including the Consent Decree. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 and Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nTesoro Earn-out Dispute. On June 17, 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of Par entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Tesoro, pursuant to which it purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in PHR. The PHR acquisition was subject to an earn-out provision during the years 2014-2016, subject to, among other things, an annual earn-out cap of $20 million. On March 22, 2018, Tesoro agreed to settle the earn-out dispute and release and discharge any related claims in exchange for our payment of $10.5 million. Please read Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nBankruptcy Matters. We emerged from the reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation ( Delta\u201d) on August 31, 2012 ( Emergence Date\u201d) when the plan of reorganization ( Plan\u201d) was consummated. Please read Item 1. - Business - Bankruptcy and Plan of Reorganization\u201d of this Form 10-K for more information.\nOperating Leases. We have various cancelable and noncancelable operating leases related to land, vehicles, office, and retail facilities and other facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. The majority of\nthe future lease payments relate to retail stations and facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products. We have operating leases for most of our retail stations with an average term of 8 years remaining and generally containing renewal options and escalation clauses. Leases for facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil and refined products have various expiration dates extending to 2044.\nIn addition, within our corporate and other and logistics segments, we have various agreements to lease storage facilities, towboats, barges, and other equipment. These leasing agreements have been classified as operating leases for financial reporting purposes and the related rental fees are charged to expense over the lease term as they become payable. The leases generally range in duration of five years or less and contain lease renewal options at fair value.\nMinimum annual lease payments extending to 2044 for operating leases to which we are legally obligated and having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):\n\nCapital Leases. We have capital lease obligations related primarily to the leases of 17 retail stations. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 15 years or more. Certain leases include escalation clauses and/or purchase options. Minimum annual lease payments including interest, for capital leases are as follows (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than our operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material affect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. We analyze our estimates on a periodic basis, including those related to fair value, impairments, natural gas and crude oil reserves, bad debts, natural gas and oil properties, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies, and litigation and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out accounting method. We value merchandise along with spare parts, materials, and supplies at average cost. Estimating the net realizable value of our inventory requires management to make assumptions about the timing of sales and the expected proceeds that will be realized for the sales.\nOur refining segment acquires all of its crude oil utilized at the Hawaii refinery from J. Aron under procurement contracts. The crude oil remains in the legal title of J. Aron and is stored in our storage tanks governed by a storage agreement. Legal title to the crude oil passes to us at the tank outlet. After processing, J. Aron takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until they are sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by J. Aron on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it. The valuation of our repurchase obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices and differentials assuming settlement at the end of the reporting period. Please read Note 11-Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In estimating fair value, we use discounted cash flow projections, recent comparable market transactions, if available, or quoted prices. We consider assumptions that third parties would make in estimating fair value, including the highest and best use of the asset. The assumptions used by another party could differ significantly from our assumptions.\nWe classify fair value balances based on the classification of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of a transaction. The inputs used to measure fair value have been placed in a hierarchy based on priority. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted, readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). Please read Note 14-Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. We obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. These valuation methods require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding characteristics of the acquired property and future revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would result in different amounts allocated to the related assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-lived Assets\nWe assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. Under the quantitative test, we compare the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the present value of expected future cash flows using a market participant discount rate. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value using observable multiples for comparable companies within our industry. These valuation methods require us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, capital projects, commodity prices, long-term growth rates, and discount rates.\nWe review property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying value. If this occurs, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined using the income approach.\nDerivatives and Other Financial instruments\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to crude oil and refined products. We manage this exposure through the use of various derivative commodity instruments. These instruments include exchange traded futures and over-the-counter swaps,\nforwards, and options.\nFor our forward contracts that are derivatives, we have elected the normal purchase normal sale exclusion, as it is our policy to fulfill or accept the physical delivery of the product and we will not net settle. Therefore, we did not recognize the unrealized gains or losses related to these contracts in our consolidated financial statements. We apply the accrual method of accounting to contracts qualifying for the normal purchase and sale exemption.\nAll derivative instruments not designated as normal purchases or sales are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. We have not designated any derivative instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges and, therefore, do not apply hedge accounting treatment.\nIn addition, we may have other financial instruments, such as warrants or embedded debt features, that may be classified as liabilities when either (a) the holders possess rights to net cash settlement, (b) physical or net equity settlement is not in our control, or (c) the instruments contain other provisions that cause us to conclude that they are not indexed to our equity. We have accounted for our obligation to repurchase crude oil and refined products from J.Aron at the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements as an embedded derivative. Additionally, we have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium on our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes represent an embedded derivative. These liabilities were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through earnings.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record asset retirement obligations ( AROs\u201d) at fair value in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by government action or contractual arrangement, to incur these costs and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. Our AROs arise from our refining, retail, and logistics operations, as well as plugging and abandonment of wells within our natural gas and crude oil operations. AROs are calculated based on the present value of the estimated removal and other closure costs using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Both expenses are recorded in Depreciation, depletion, and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the settlement amount and the recorded liability is recorded as a gain or loss on asset disposals in our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate settlement dates by considering our past practice, industry practice, management's intent, and estimated economic lives.\nWe cannot currently estimate the fair value for certain AROs primarily because we cannot estimate settlement dates (or ranges of dates) associated with these assets. These AROs include hazardous materials disposal (such as petroleum manufacturing by-products, chemical catalysts, and sealed insulation material containing asbestos) and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of our refining facilities, terminal facilities, or pipelines, including the demolition or removal of certain major processing units, buildings, tanks, pipelines, or other equipment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carry forwards. The realizability of deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly based on a more likely than not\u201d standard and, to the extent this threshold is not met, a valuation allowance is recorded. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future results of operations, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nBased upon the level of historical taxable income, significant book losses during the prior periods, and projections for future results of operations over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, among other factors, management concluded that we did not meet the more likely than not\u201d requirement in order to recognize deferred tax assets and therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life or increase the capacity of facilities as well as expenditures that prevent environmental contamination. We expense costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that\ndo not contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Cost estimates are based on the expected timing and extent of remedial actions required by governing agencies, experience gained from similar sites for which environmental assessments or remediation have been completed, and the amount of our anticipated liability considering the proportional liability and financial abilities of other responsible parties. Usually, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. Estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value and are presented within Other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Environmental expenses are recorded in Operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income decreased from $72.6M in 2017 to $39.4M in 2018, primarily due to lower refining margins, costs related to the Tesoro earn-out settlement, higher acquisition costs, and decreased equity earnings from Laramie Energy. This was partially offset by improved retail margins.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $132.1M in 2018 compared to $140.8M in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to lower refining margins from unfavorable crude differentials, partially offset by improved retail margins and higher refined product sales volumes. \n\n- Revenues increased from $2.4B in 2017 to $3.4B in 2018, largely driven by higher crude oil prices and sales volumes. Cost of revenues also increased accordingly.\n\n- Operating income for the refining segment decreased by $12.7M in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to lower refining margins in Hawaii. Retail operating income increased by $12.5M due to higher sales prices and volumes from the Northwest Retail acquisition.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $48.4M in 2018, mainly related to the diesel hydrotreater project and maintenance. The 2019 capital expenditure budget is $100-110M.\n\n- Net cash provided by operating activities was $90.6M in 2018 compared to $106.5M in 2017. Net cash used in investing activities was $175.8M in 2018 versus $31.7M in 2017, largely due to acquisition spending.\n\n- Long-term debt totaled $416.5M. The company believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flows to meet obligations over the next 12 months."}
