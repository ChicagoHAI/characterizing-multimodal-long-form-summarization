You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Any such statement speaks only as of the date of this report, and in the case of any documents that may be incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents.

The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations involving the Company's acquisition of equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company's ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. At December 31, 2015, the Company's reporting unit had positive equity and the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries. The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity's proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.\nTable 189: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the balance sheet method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company conducted an analysis to assess the need for a valuation allowance at December 31, 2015, and determined that no valuation allowance was required. As part of this assessment, all available evidence, including both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether based on the weight of such evidence, a valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets was needed. A valuation allowance is deemed to be needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The future realization of the deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carry forward periods.\nThe benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized. The election has been made to record interest expense related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable, and the exposure for penalties related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2015 of $5,268,000, an increase of $907,000 (20.8%) from $4,361,000 in 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.70 for 2015 and $0.54 for 2014. For 2015, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.03% and a return on average assets of 0.85%, as compared to 4.98% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2014.\nNet income for 2014 increased $1,304,000 (42.7%) from $3,057,000 in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $0.34. For 2013, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.38% and return on average assets of 0.52%.

At December 31, 2015, net loans totaled $289,102,000, up $31,045,000 (12.0%) from the ending balance of $258,057,000 at December 31, 2014. Deposits increased $19,997,000 or 3.9% from $510,693,000 at December 31, 2014 to $530,690,000 at December 31, 2015. Shareholders' equity decreased $3,572,000 or 4.0% from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014 to $86,075,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company ended 2015 with a leverage capital ratio of 11.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 20.6% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 11.6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 22.9% at the end of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.63% in 2015, 3.54% in 2014, and 3.45% in 2013. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,312,000 (6.9%), from $19,067,000 in 2014 to $20,379,000 in 2015. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,387,000 (7.8%), from $17,680,000 in 2013 to $19,067,000 in 2014.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,098,000 (5.4%) from $20,242,000 in 2014 to $21,340,000 in 2015. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is comprised of two components - rate (down $285,000) and volume (up $1,383,000). The rate decrease primarily occurred in the loan portfolio. While average loans increased by $25,830,000 (10.2%) from $253,898,000 during 2014 to $279,728,000 during 2015, due to the overall lower interest rate environment, the new loans added were at lower yields than the existing loans. Yield on loans decreased from 5.37% in 2014 to 5.01% in 2015 and contributed a decrease of $1,076,000 in loan interest income. The decrease of $1,076,000 in interest income created from the decrease in rates on the loan balances was partially offset by an increase in rates on the investment portfolio resulting in an increase of $790,000 related to the investments. This increase in investment income due to rates can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. The volume increase of $1,383,000 was primarily from the increase in average loans mentioned above ($1,466,000) and partially offset by a decrease in investments ($83,000). When compared to 2014, average investment securities decreased $3,092,000 (1.1%) from $284,436,000 in 2014 compared to $281,344,000 in 2015.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased from $19,170,000 in 2013 to $20,235,000 in 2014, representing a 5.6% increase. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is comprised of two components - rate (up $591,000) and volume (up $474,000). The rate increase primarily occurred in the investment portfolio which can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. Investment securities added $1,211,000 in additional interest income related to rate. The average yield on investments increased from 1.93% in 2013 to 2.32% in 2014. The increase in interest income created from the investment portfolio was partially offset by a decrease in rates on the loan balances. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.61% to 5.37% and was caused by principal reductions from normal payments and paydowns from loans being loaned out at lower market rates. The volume increase of $474,000 was also primarily related to the investments. Average investment balances were up $26,273,000 (10.2%) from $258,164,000 in 2013 to $284,436,000 in 2014. Funds received from the increase in deposit balances were primarily deployed in the investment portfolio.\nInterest expense was $207,000 (17.7%) lower in 2015 compared to 2014, decreasing from $1,168,000 to $961,000. The primary decrease in interest expense relates to lower rates (down $222,000). Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased 6 basis points from 0.33% to 0.27% in 2014 compared to 2015. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities were $356,052,000 (or $180,000 and 0.1% higher) in 2015 compared to $355,872,000 in 2014. The higher balances had only a slight impact on the overall interest expense.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was $322,000 (21.6%) lower in 2014 compared to 2013, decreasing from $1,490,000 to $1,168,000. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities was 1.9% higher in 2014 ($355,872,000) compared to 2013 ($349,329,000). The slightly higher balances, however, did not increase interest expense as the increases occurred in lower cost checking and savings accounts, which were slightly offset by decreases in higher cost time deposits and other borrowings. Despite the increase in average interest bearing balances the Company experienced a decrease in interest expense of $95,000 due to this increase in interest checking and money market balances offset by the decrease in time deposits and other borrowings. The overall decrease in interest expense was also due to lower rates, which accounted for a $227,000 decrease in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013. Rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 10 basis points from 0.43% in 2013 to 0.33% in 2014.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses. Table Two provides an analysis of net interest margin on earning assets setting forth average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity; interest income earned and interest expense paid and average rates earned and paid; and the net interest margin on earning assets.

As a result of the improving credit quality over the past several years and a reduction in historical loan loss rates the Company did not require any loan or lease loss provision in 2015. As a result of the recoveries in 2014, the Company reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses by recording a negative provision for loan and lease losses of $541,000. The level of non-performing loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to $1,643,000 at December 31, 2015. For additional information see the Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases.\u201d While the level of non-performing loans and leases has decreased, there remains a challenging economy in the Company's market areas and in the United States, in general. This may potentially negatively impact the Company's borrowers and as a result the Company has maintained the ALLL at a level that is higher than the long-term historical averages.

The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to lower fees from service charges on deposit accounts (down $64,000 or 11.4%) and no life insurance death benefits in 2015 as compared to $99,000 in 2014. The decrease in service charges is related to a decrease in insufficient funds income.\nNoninterest income increased $162,000 (8.0%) to $2,177,000 in 2014 from the 2013 level. The increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily related to income from security sales which increased from $36,000 in 2013 to $208,000 in 2014. In addition, rental income from OREO properties increased from $316,000 in 2013 to $365,000 in 2014.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $8,528,000 (down $248,000 or 2.8%) for 2015 as compared to $8,776,000 in 2014. The decrease in salary and benefits was due in part to lower incentive compensation expense and lower employee benefits. Incentive accruals decreased $182,000, from $672,000 in 2014 to $490,000 in 2015 and other employee benefits decreased $107,000 (7.0%) from $1,529,000 in 2014 to $1,422,000 in 2015. The decrease in incentive compensation was primarily due to the Company not reaching all of the incentive targets in 2015. The decrease in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to lower employee placement fees paid in 2015.\nSalaries and benefits were $8,776,000 (up $260,000 or 3.1%) for 2014 as compared to $8,516,000 in 2013. The increase in salary and benefits was due in part to increased incentive compensation expense and higher employee benefits partially offset by a decrease in core salaries. Incentive accruals increased $54,000, from $618,000 in 2013 to $672,000 in 2014 and other employee benefits increased $162,000 (11.9%) from $1,367,000 in 2013 to $1,529,000 in 2014. Salaries decreased $66,000 (1.1%) from $6,048,000 in 2013 to $5,982,000 in 2014. The increase in incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the Company's net income in relationship to incentive targeted net income goals. The increase in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to higher employee placement fees paid in 2014 to attract lending officers and a chief credit officer. The decrease in salaries is related to a lower number of employees. Average full-time equivalent employees decreased from 106 during 2013 to 102 during 2014.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2015 was $322,000 (down $42,000 or 11.5%) compared to $364,000 in 2014. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower property write-downs. In 2015, write-downs were $76,000 compared to $165,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2015 totaled $245,000 compared to $430,000 in 2014. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2015. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to a loss of $1,000 in 2015.\nThe total OREO expense in 2014 was $364,000 (down $572,000 or 61.1%) compared to $936,000 in 2013. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower write-downs due to updated property valuations. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2013. In 2014, write-downs were $165,000 compared to $293,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to $44,000 in 2013 and operating expenses on the properties held in 2014 totaled $430,000 compared to $686,000 in 2013.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $5,000 (0.4%) during 2015 to $1,183,000, compared to $1,188,000 in 2014. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.7%) during 2015 to $690,000 compared to $724,000 in 2014. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nOccupancy expense decreased $24,000 (2.0%) during 2014 to $1,188,000, compared to $1,212,000 in 2013. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.5%) during 2014 to $724,000 compared to $758,000 in 2013. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $39,000 (10.7%) during 2015 to $324,000, compared to $363,000 in 2014. The majority of this decrease relates to a lower assessment rate as a result of lower nonperforming assets. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2015 were $71,000 compared to $70,000 in 2014.\nFDIC assessments increased $51,000 (16.3%) during 2014 to $363,000, compared to $312,000 in 2013. The majority of this increase relates to an adjustment to the accrual based upon an updated analysis performed in 2013 revealing that the accrual should be reduced. This adjustment occurred in 2013 and did not reoccur in 2014. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2014 were $70,000, no change from 2013.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outsourced item processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors' expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>348 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telephone and postage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,087 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expenses were $2,962,000 (down $415,000 or 12.3%) for 2015 as compared to $3,377,000 for 2014. The decrease in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses, which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional services, decreased $319,000 (27.0%), from $1,182,000 in 2014 to $863,000 in 2015. Legal expenses decreased $255,000 (61.6%) from $414,000 in 2014 to $255,000 during 2015. This decrease is primarily related to a lower number of problem loan credits and OREO properties. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2015 was 62.9% as compared to 70.0% in 2014.\nOther expenses were $3,377,000 (up $290,000 or 9.4%) for 2014 as compared to $3,087,000 for 2013. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses increased $249,000 (26.7%), from $933,000 in 2013 to $1,182,000 in 2014. Legal expenses increased $182,000 (78.4%) from $232,000 in 2013 to $414,000 during 2014. This increase is primarily related to problem loan credits and the resolution of issues associated with a former OREO property. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2014 was 70.0% as compared to 75.6% in 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 33.7%, 34.5%, and 29.2% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $516,000, $419,000, and $197,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,412,000, $1,194,000, and $1,213,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher level of income taxes and effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted from the Company realizing significantly less benefits of Enterprise Zone credits on our State tax return as the program has been significantly reduced and an increase in taxable income in 2014. Taxable income increased from $4,315,000 in 2013 to $6,653,000 in 2014.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $634,640,000 at December 31, 2015 as compared to $617,754,000 at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $16,886,000 (2.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2015 were $623,049,000, up $17,802,000 or 2.9% from the 2014 total of $605,247,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement asset/liability management strategies as part of our contingency funding plan and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors. Table Six below summarizes the values of the Company's investment securities held on December 31 of the years indicated. The Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading in any of the years indicated below.\nTable Six: Investment Securities Composition\n(dollars in thousands)\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>Available-for-sale (at fair value) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>US Government Agencies and US Government-Sponsored Agencies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>244,160 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Obligations of states and political subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,903 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate debt securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,609 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total available-for-sale investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,819 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Held-to-maturity (at amortized cost) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>US Government Agencies and US Government-Sponsored Agencies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total held-to-maturity investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Table Fifteen, Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields,\u201d for a breakdown of the investment securities by maturity and the corresponding weighted average yields.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company concentrates its lending activities in the following principal areas: (1) commercial; (2) commercial real estate; (3) multi-family real estate; (4) real estate construction (both commercial and residential); (5) residential real estate; (6) lease financing receivable; (7) agriculture; and (8) consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, these categories accounted for approximately 12%, 68%, 8%, 5%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 1%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio. This mix was relatively unchanged compared to 10%, 73%, 5%, 3%, 5%, 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. Continuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $80 million in new loans in 2015. This production was partially offset by normal pay downs and payoffs, but still resulted in an overall net increase in net loans and leases of $31.0 million (12.0%) from December 31, 2014. The market in which the Company operates has begun to show demand for credit products as the continued low rate environment and expectations for economic expansion have increased refinancing as well as new loan activity. The Company reported net increases in balances for commercial loans ($11,009,000 or 43.7%), commercial real estate ($5,720,000 or 3.0%), multi-family real estate ($9,327,000 or 65.8%), real estate construction ($6,505,000 or 81.0%), and residential real estate ($891,000 or 6.7%), and decreases in lease financing receivable ($554,000 or 43.1), agriculture ($451,000 or 15.6%), and consumer loans ($1,794,000 or 36.5%). Table Seven below summarizes the composition of the loan and lease portfolio for the past five years as of December 31.\nTable Seven: Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Multi-family </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,580 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,695 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease financing receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,725 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agriculture </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>294,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred loan fees, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(221 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(287 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(313 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(230 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(302 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allowance for loan and lease losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,975 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,301 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,346 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,781 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,041 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net loans and leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>251,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,731 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA significant portion of the Company's loans and leases are direct loans and leases made to individuals and local businesses. The Company relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by American River Bank officers, directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions. The Company makes loans and leases to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose and a viable primary repayment source, generally supported by a secondary source of repayment.\nCommercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs and working capital and loans for equipment or vehicle purchases. Consumer loans include traditional consumer products such as secured and unsecured personal loans and loans to finance the purchase of autos, boats and recreational vehicles. Construction loans are generally comprised of commitments to customers within the Company's service area for construction of owner-occupied commercial properties. Other real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by first trust deeds on commercial or multi-family properties, typically with maturities from 3 to 10 years and original loan-to-value ratios generally from 65% to 75%. In general, except in the case of loans under SBA programs, the Company does not make long-term mortgage loans.\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubprime\u201d real estate loans generally refer to residential mortgages made to higher-risk borrowers with lower credit and/or income histories. Within the banking industry, many of these loans were originated with adjustable interest rates that reset upward after an introductory period. These subprime\u201d loans coupled with declines in housing prices led to an increase in default rates resulting in many instances of increased foreclosure rates as the adjustable interest rates reset to higher levels. The Company did not have any such subprime\u201d loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAverage loans and leases in 2015 were $279,728,000 which represents an increase of $25,830,000 (10.2%) compared to the average in 2014. Average loans and leases in 2014 were $253,898,000 which represents an increase of $1,091,000 (0.4%) compared to the average in 2013.\nRisk Elements\nThe Company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality, extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies. Additionally, the Company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio. Management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the Company's loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth. Management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process, through active credit administration and regular monitoring. With this in mind, management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.\nUltimately, underlying trends in economic and business cycles influence credit quality. American River Bank's business is concentrated in the Sacramento Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a diversified economy, but with a large State of California government presence and employment base; in Sonoma County, which is focused on businesses within the two communities in which the Bank has offices (Santa Rosa and Healdsburg); and in Amador County, in which the Bank is primarily focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices (Jackson, Pioneer, and Ione). The economy of Sonoma County is diversified with professional services, manufacturing, agriculture and real estate investment and construction, while the economy of Amador County is reliant upon government, services, retail trade, manufacturing industries and Indian gaming. The Company has recently entered the Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda County markets with loan productions offices in San Ramon and San Jose. The economies of Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties are diversified with professional services, manufacturing, technology related companies, real estate investment and construction.\nThe Company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate. The ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate. The Company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans. The more significant factors management considers involve the following: lease rates and terms, vacancy rates, absorption and sale rates and capitalization rates; real estate values, supply and demand factors, and rates of return; operating expenses; inflation and deflation; and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including, in some instances, personal guarantees.\nIn extending credit and commitments to borrowers, the Company generally requires collateral and/or guarantees as security. The repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. The Company's requirement for collateral and/or guarantees is determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with management's evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing properties, residences and other real property. The Company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets, obtaining deeds of trust, or outright possession among other means.\nIn management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately 86% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 87% at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the residential land portion of the Company's loan portfolio carries more than the normal credit risk, due primarily to curtailed demand for new and resale residential property, relative to pre-recession levels, a resulting oversupply of unsold residential land, and observed reductions in values throughout the Company's market area. Management has responded by evaluating loans that it considers to carry any significant risk above the normal risk of collectability by taking actions where possible to reduce credit risk exposure by methods that include, but are not limited to, seeking liquidation of the loan by the borrower, seeking additional tangible collateral or other repayment support, converting the property through judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, and other collection techniques. Management currently believes that it maintains its allowance for loan and lease losses at levels adequate to reflect the loss risk inherent in its total loan portfolio.\nTable 219: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA decline in the economy in general, or decline in real estate values in the Company's primary market areas, in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of real estate loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. This could adversely affect the Company's future prospects, results of operations, profitability and stock price. Management believes that its lending practices and underwriting standards are structured with the intent to minimize losses; however, there is no assurance that losses will not occur. The Company's loan practices and underwriting standards include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) maintaining a thorough understanding of the Company's service area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area, (2) maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers' knowledge, capacity, and market position in their field of expertise, (3) basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project, but also on the borrowers' capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations (whether sale or income performance), and (4) maintaining conforming and prudent loan-to-value and loan-to-cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the Company's lending officers or contracted third-party professionals.\nNonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases\nManagement places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or if a loss is expected, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases are partially or fully charged off when, in the opinion of management, collection of such amount appears unlikely.\nThe recorded investments in non-performing loans and leases, which includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases that were 90 days or more past due and on accrual, totaled $1,643,000 and $1,653,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $1,643,000 in non-performing loans and leases at December 31, 2015, there were four real estate loans totaling $1,493,000, four consumer loans totaling $120,000 and a single commercial loan totaling $30,000. At December 31, 2014, the $1,653,000 in non-performing loans consisted of three real estate loans totaling $845,000; two commercial loans totaling $666,000 and three consumer loans totaling $142,000.\nThe net interest due on nonaccrual loans and leases but excluded from interest income was approximately $145,000 during 2015, $116,000 during 2014, and $327,000 during 2013. Interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases was approximately $59,000 in 2015, $84,000 in 2014 and $161,000 in 2013. Table Eight below sets forth nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases past due 90 days or more and on accrual as of year-end for the past five years.\nTable Eight: Non-Performing Loans and Leases\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Past due 90 days or more and still accruing: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease financing receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonaccrual: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,775 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease financing receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>822 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing loans and leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no loan or lease concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans and leases not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases as of December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any potential problem loans, which were accruing and current at December 31, 2015, where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms and that would result in a significant loss to the Company apart from those loans identified in the Bank's impairment analysis.\nTable 222: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement monitors the Company's performance metrics including the ratios related to non-performing loans and leases. From 2008 to 2010, the Company experienced an increase in non-performing loans and leases. In 2011, the focused efforts of the previous years resulted in a decrease in these levels. In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the level of non-performing loans and leases continued to decrease to a level below the amount reported at December 31, 2008. However, the variations in the amount of non-performing loans and leases does not directly impact the level of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses as management monitors each of the loans and leases for loss potential or probability of loss on an individual basis using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nImpaired Loans and Leases\nThe Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. The measurement of impairment may be based on (i) the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or lease discounted at the loan's or lease's original effective interest rate, (ii) the observable market price of the impaired loan or lease, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral-dependent loan. The Company does not apply this definition to smaller-balance loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for credit risk. In assessing whether a loan or lease is impaired, the Company typically reviews loans or leases graded substandard or lower with outstanding principal balances in excess of $100,000, as well as loans considered troubled debt restructures with outstanding principal balances in excess of $25,000. The Company identifies troubled debt restructures by reviewing each renewal, modification, or extension of a loan with a screening document. This document is designed to identify any characteristics of such a loan that would qualify it as a troubled debt restructure. If the characteristics are not present that would qualify a loan as a troubled debt restructure, it is deemed to be a modification.\nThe recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $21,365,000 at December 31, 2015 and had a related valuation allowance of $899,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2015 was approximately $20,818,000. As of December 31, 2014, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $25,120,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,603,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2014 was approximately $24,127,000. As of December 31, 2013, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $27,034,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,598,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2013 was approximately $27,975,000.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, which is based upon management's estimate of those losses. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge-offs. Actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process. The model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management's judgment after consideration of numerous factors including, but not limited to: (i) local and regional economic conditions, (ii) the financial condition of the borrowers, (iii) loan impairment and the related level of expected charge-offs, (iv) evaluation of industry trends, (v) industry and other concentrations, (vi) loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management, (vii) continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio, (viii) ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential, (ix) quarterly review by the Board of Directors, and (x) assessments by banking regulators and other third parties. Management and the Board of Directors evaluate the ALLL and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures, such as knowledge of the borrowers' business, valuation of collateral, the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ALLL totaled $4,975,000 or 1.69% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2015, $5,301,000 or 2.01% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2014, and $5,346,000 or 2.08% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses from $5,346,000 at December 31, 2013 to $4,975,000 at December 31, 2015, was mainly due to a decrease in historical losses impacting the loss factor used in calculating the reserve on loans collectively valued for impairment. The Company establishes general and specific reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The ALLL is composed of categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating; however, the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses. While management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on changes in economic conditions and other matters. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's ALLL. Such agencies may require the Company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases was 302.8% at December 31, 2015 and 320.7% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of impaired loans and leases was 23.3% at December 31, 2015 and 21.1% at December 31, 2014. Of the total non-performing and impaired loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2015, there were $4,757,000 in loans or leases that had been reduced by partial charge-offs of $816,000.\nAt December 31, 2015, there was $12,607,000 in impaired loans or leases that did not carry a specific reserve. Of this amount, $3,900,000 were loans or leases that had previous partial charge-offs and $8,707,000 in loans or leases that were analyzed and determined not to require a specific reserve or charge-off because the collateral value or discounted cash flow value exceeded the loan or lease balance. Prior to 2013, the Company had been operating in a market that had experienced significant decreases in real estate values of commercial, residential, land, and construction properties. As such, the Company continues to focus on monitoring collateral values for those loans considered collateral dependent. The collateral evaluations performed by the Company are updated as necessary, which is generally once every twelve months, and are reviewed by a qualified credit officer.\nThe Company's policy with regard to loan or lease charge-offs continues to be that a loan or lease is charged off against the ALLL when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. As previously discussed in the Impaired Loans and Leases\u201d section, certain loans are evaluated for impairment. Generally, if a loan is collateralized by real estate, and considered collateral dependent, the impaired portion will be charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses unless it is in the process of collection, in which case a specific reserve may be warranted. If the collateral is other than real estate and considered impaired, a specific reserve may be warranted.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Formula allocations are calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Historical loss factors are based upon the Company's loss experience. These historical loss factors are adjusted for changes in the business cycle and for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. The discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is prudent and adequate. However, no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company made a specific enhancement to its methodology for determining the general reserve component of the ALLL. The enhancement related specifically to the methodology used to calculate the qualitative factors with respect to non-impaired loans graded watch, special mention and substandard by eliminating the use of multipliers. The ALLL methodology was also revised to add an additional qualitative factor, by loan grade, in calculating the general reserve component of the ALLL. Management believes that the allocation of the ALLL to each loan risk grade, within each loan type has become more precise under the methodology enhancement. The implementation of the ALLL model revision did not have a material impact on the calculation of the required allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 226: <table><tr><td>47 </td>

Estate Owned\nThe balance in OREO at December 31, 2015 consisted of three properties acquired through foreclosure. The balance in OREO at December 31, 2014 consisted of seven properties. During 2015, the Company received $1,153,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of four OREO properties with net losses of $1,000 in the aggregate recognized on these sales and, prior to sale, there was a write-down of $156,000 to the OREO allowance and $76,000 to expense on two of the four properties. Furthermore, there were capitalized costs of $126,000 on a single existing property. There was $3,551,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 with no valuation allowance and $4,803,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2014 with a valuation allowance of $156,000.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2015, total deposits were $530,690,000 representing an increase of $19,997,000 (3.9%) from the December 31, 2014 balance of $510,693,000. The Company's deposit growth plan for 2015 was to concentrate its efforts on increasing noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing money market and interest-bearing checking, and savings accounts, while continuing to focus on reducing overall interest expense. Due to these efforts, the Company experienced increases during 2015 in noninterest-bearing demand ($34,850,000 or 22.4%), interest-bearing checking ($462,000 or 0.8%), and savings ($241,000 or 0.4%) and decreases in money market ($12,439,000 or 8.4%) and time deposit ($3,117,000 or 3.6%) accounts. The decrease in money market accounts is related to the plan to reduce interest expense as the Company evaluated the rate structure on some of the higher cost money market accounts and reduced the interest rates on some relationships.\nTable 232: <table><tr><td>49 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Borrowed Funds\n\tOther borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB\u201d).

The 2015 Program authorized the repurchase during 2015 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, on July 15, 2015, the Company approved and authorized an additional amount of 5% to be purchased under the 2015 Program. During 2015, the Company repurchased 790,989 shares of its common stock at an average price of $9.92 per share. On January 20, 2016, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2016 (the 2016 Program\u201d). The 2016 Program authorized the repurchase during 2016 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, or approximately 367,182 shares based on the 7,343,649 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Any repurchases under the 2016 Program will be made from time to time by the Company in the open market as conditions allow. All such transactions will be structured to comply with Commission Rule 10b-18 and all shares repurchased under the 2016 Program will be retired. The number, price and timing of the repurchases will be at the Company's sole discretion and the 2016 Program may be re-evaluated depending on market conditions, capital and liquidity needs or other factors. Based on such re-evaluation, the Board of Directors may suspend, terminate, modify or cancel the 2016 Program at any time without notice.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares in 2011 or 2010 and repurchased 575,389 shares in 2012 and 849,404 shares in 2013. Share amounts have been adjusted for stock dividends and/or splits. See Part II, Item 5, Stock Repurchases\u201d for more information regarding stock repurchases.\nThe Company and American River Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and American River Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the most recent regulatory notification categorized American River Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action plan. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's categories.\nTable 236: <table><tr><td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, shareholders' equity was $86,075,000, representing a decrease of $3,572,000 (5.1%) from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014. The decrease resulted from a decrease in other comprehensive income of $1,268,000 as a result of the decrease in the unrealized gain on securities due to an increase in interest rates, additions from net income of $5,269,000 for the period and the stock based compensation of $271,000, offset by repurchases of common stock of $7,843,000. In 2014, shareholders' equity increased $2,627,000 (3.0%) from $87,020,000 at December 31, 2013.

The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules included an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components and the calculation of risk-weighted assets.\nEffective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 Billion or more and banks like American River Bank were required to comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which would consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets ( leverage\u201d) ratio of 4%.\nIn addition, a capital conservation buffer,\u201d is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td>51 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Risk Management\nOverview. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan, investment and deposit functions. The goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the Company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the Company to undue interest rate risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies. The Company has an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, made up of Company management that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates.\nAsset/Liability Management. Activities involved in asset/liability management include but are not limited to lending, accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset/liability management. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates. The asset/liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments. The Company uses simulation models to forecast earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity.\nSimulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes. Using computer-modeling techniques, with specialized software built for this specific purpose for financial institutions, the Company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity. A balance sheet is prepared using detailed inputs of actual loans, securities and interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. deposits/borrowings). The balance sheet is processed using multiple interest rate scenarios. The scenarios include a rising rate forecast, a flat rate forecast and a falling rate forecast which take place within a one-year time frame. The net interest income is measured over a one and a two year periods assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve-month horizon. The simulation modeling attempts to estimate changes in the Company's net interest income utilizing a detailed current balance sheet.\nAfter a review of the model results as of December 31, 2015, the Company does not consider the fluctuations from the base case, to have a material impact on the Company's projected results and are within the tolerance levels outlined in the Company's interest rate risk polices. The simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions, which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations. Therefore, they do not reflect likely actual results, but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing or maturity. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons. The differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps. A positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position. An asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to expand. This results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time. Conversely, a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect. A negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position. A liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to contract, while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing, or other commercial concerns, primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary. In general, inflation primarily affects the Company through its effect on market rates of interest, which affects the Company's ability to attract loan customers. Inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand, and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future. In addition to its effects on interest rates, inflation increases overall operating expenses. Inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nTable 241: <table><tr><td>52 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients. Both assets and liabilities contribute to the Company's liquidity position. Federal funds lines, short-term investments and securities, and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity, along with deposit increases, while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity. The Company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns, current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs. Commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were approximately $26,730,000 and $238,000, respectively. Such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe Company's sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks, overnight funds sold to correspondent banks, unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale. On December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets totaled $229.7 million or 36.2% of total assets compared to $234.7 million or 38.0% of total assets on December 31, 2014. In addition to liquid assets, the Company maintains short-term lines of credit in the amount of $17,000,000 with two of its correspondent banks. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $17,000,000 available under these credit lines. Additionally, American River Bank is a member of the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, American River Bank could have arranged for up to $89,326,000 in secured borrowings from the FHLB. These borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $78,326,000 available under these secured borrowing arrangements. American River Bank also has a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank. The borrowing can be secured by pledging selected loans and investment securities. Based on the amount of assets pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2015, the Company's borrowing capacity was $11,371,000.\nThe Company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and, as such, its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations. Accordingly, management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits.\nLiquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities. The Company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available-for-sale category to meet liquidity needs. These securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise. American River Bank can also pledge additional securities to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB.\nThe maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in Table Thirteen below for the period presented. These deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and, therefore, are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>Table Thirteen: Certificates of Deposit Maturities </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than $250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over $250,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three months through six months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over six months through twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan and lease demand also affects the Company's liquidity position.

The yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis. Yields may not represent actual future income to be recorded. Timing of principal prepayments on mortgage-backed securities may increase or decrease depending on market factors and the borrowers' ability to make unscheduled principal payments. Fast prepayments on bonds that were purchased with a premium will result in a lower yield and slower prepayments on premium bonds will result in a higher yield, the opposite would be true for bonds purchased at a discount. Table Fifteen does not include FHLB Stock, which does not have stated maturity dates or readily available market values.

These financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2015, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options or similar instruments. At origination, real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% to 75%. In addition, the majority of the Company's commitments have variable interest rates. The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commitments to extend credit (dollars in thousands): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residences </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate, construction and land development commitments secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other unused commitments, principally commercial loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles ( SPV\u201d) to dispose of problem assets. The SPV is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent corporation goes bankrupt. Under certain circumstances, these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and non-performing assets. The Company does not use those vehicles or any other structures to dispose of problem assets.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company leases certain facilities at which it conducts its operations. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are noted in Table Sixteen below. Table Sixteen below presents certain of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Included in the table are amounts payable under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, Deferred Fees Plan and salary continuation agreements listed in the Other Long-Term Liabilities\u2026\u201d category. At December 31, 2015, these amounts represented $4,089,000 most of which is anticipated to be primarily payable at least five years in the future.\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>Table Sixteen: Contractual Obligations </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of Deposit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company's Balance Sheet under GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,633 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td>55 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued FASB Accounting Standards Update (the Update\u201d) 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure. Under this Update, FASB amended existing guidance to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. These amendments clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either:\n(1)\t the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or\n(2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.\nThe amendments in this Update were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effects of adopting this Update did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This Update requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments within this update are effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update, but does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Update 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10). Under this Update, FASB enhanced the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This Update contains several provisions, including but not limited to 1) require equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) eliminated the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value; and 4) require separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable 254: <table><tr><td>56 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\t Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including, but not limited to, matters described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may contain words related to future projections including, but not limited to, words such as believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d and variations of those words and similar words that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the legislation promulgated by the United States Congress and actions taken by governmental agencies, including the United States Department of the Treasury, to deal with challenges to the U.S. financial system; (2) the risks presented by economic volatility and recession, which could adversely affect credit quality, collateral values, including real estate collateral, investment values, liquidity and loan originations and loan portfolio delinquency rates; (3) variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets and return on assets; (4) potential loan and lease losses; (5) potential expenses associated with resolving non-performing assets as well as regulatory changes; (6) changes in the interest rate environment including interest rates charged on loans, earned on securities investments and paid on deposits and other borrowed funds; (7) competitive effects; (8) potential declines in fee and other noninterest income earned associated with economic factors as well as regulatory changes; (9) general economic conditions nationally, regionally, and within our operating markets could be less favorable than expected or could have a more direct and pronounced effect on us than expected and adversely affect our ability to continue internal growth at historical rates and maintain the quality of our earning assets; (10) changes in the regulatory environment including increased capital and regulatory compliance requirements and further government intervention in the U.S. financial system; (11) changes in business conditions and inflation; (12) changes in securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets; (13) potential data processing, cybersecurity and other operational systems failures, breach or fraud; (14) potential decline in real estate values in our operating markets; (15) the effects of uncontrollable events such as terrorism, the threat of terrorism or the impact of military conflicts in connection with the conduct of the war on terrorism by the United States and its allies, negative financial and economic conditions, natural disasters, and disruption of power supplies and communications; (16) changes in accounting standards, tax laws or regulations and interpretations of such standards, laws or regulations; (17) projected business increases following any future strategic expansion could be lower than expected; (18) the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our earnings; (19) the reputation of the financial services industry could experience further deterioration, which could adversely affect our ability to access markets for funding and to acquire and retain customers; and (20) the efficiencies we may expect to receive from any investments in personnel and infrastructure may not be realized.\nThe factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in this report and other cautionary statements and information set forth in this report should be carefully considered and understood as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements contained in this report, when evaluating the business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. By their nature, they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future results and shareholder values may differ significantly from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Any such statement speaks only as of the date of this report, and in the case of any documents that may be incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents. We do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report any new information, future event or other circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. However, your attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K.\n 33 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations involving the Company's acquisition of equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company's ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. At December 31, 2015, the Company's reporting unit had positive equity and the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries. The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity's proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.\n 34 \n \nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the balance sheet method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company conducted an analysis to assess the need for a valuation allowance at December 31, 2015, and determined that no valuation allowance was required. As part of this assessment, all available evidence, including both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether based on the weight of such evidence, a valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets was needed. A valuation allowance is deemed to be needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The future realization of the deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carry forward periods.\nThe benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized. The election has been made to record interest expense related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable, and the exposure for penalties related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2015 of $5,268,000, an increase of $907,000 (20.8%) from $4,361,000 in 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.70 for 2015 and $0.54 for 2014. For 2015, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.03% and a return on average assets of 0.85%, as compared to 4.98% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2014.\nNet income for 2014 increased $1,304,000 (42.7%) from $3,057,000 in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $0.34. For 2013, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.38% and return on average assets of 0.52%.

At December 31, 2015, net loans totaled $289,102,000, up $31,045,000 (12.0%) from the ending balance of $258,057,000 at December 31, 2014. Deposits increased $19,997,000 or 3.9% from $510,693,000 at December 31, 2014 to $530,690,000 at December 31, 2015. Shareholders' equity decreased $3,572,000 or 4.0% from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014 to $86,075,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company ended 2015 with a leverage capital ratio of 11.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 20.6% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 11.6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 22.9% at the end of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.63% in 2015, 3.54% in 2014, and 3.45% in 2013. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,312,000 (6.9%), from $19,067,000 in 2014 to $20,379,000 in 2015. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,387,000 (7.8%), from $17,680,000 in 2013 to $19,067,000 in 2014.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,098,000 (5.4%) from $20,242,000 in 2014 to $21,340,000 in 2015. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is comprised of two components - rate (down $285,000) and volume (up $1,383,000). The rate decrease primarily occurred in the loan portfolio. While average loans increased by $25,830,000 (10.2%) from $253,898,000 during 2014 to $279,728,000 during 2015, due to the overall lower interest rate environment, the new loans added were at lower yields than the existing loans. Yield on loans decreased from 5.37% in 2014 to 5.01% in 2015 and contributed a decrease of $1,076,000 in loan interest income. The decrease of $1,076,000 in interest income created from the decrease in rates on the loan balances was partially offset by an increase in rates on the investment portfolio resulting in an increase of $790,000 related to the investments. This increase in investment income due to rates can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. The volume increase of $1,383,000 was primarily from the increase in average loans mentioned above ($1,466,000) and partially offset by a decrease in investments ($83,000). When compared to 2014, average investment securities decreased $3,092,000 (1.1%) from $284,436,000 in 2014 compared to $281,344,000 in 2015.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased from $19,170,000 in 2013 to $20,235,000 in 2014, representing a 5.6% increase. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is comprised of two components - rate (up $591,000) and volume (up $474,000). The rate increase primarily occurred in the investment portfolio which can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. Investment securities added $1,211,000 in additional interest income related to rate. The average yield on investments increased from 1.93% in 2013 to 2.32% in 2014. The increase in interest income created from the investment portfolio was partially offset by a decrease in rates on the loan balances. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.61% to 5.37% and was caused by principal reductions from normal payments and paydowns from loans being loaned out at lower market rates. The volume increase of $474,000 was also primarily related to the investments. Average investment balances were up $26,273,000 (10.2%) from $258,164,000 in 2013 to $284,436,000 in 2014. Funds received from the increase in deposit balances were primarily deployed in the investment portfolio.\nInterest expense was $207,000 (17.7%) lower in 2015 compared to 2014, decreasing from $1,168,000 to $961,000. The primary decrease in interest expense relates to lower rates (down $222,000). Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased 6 basis points from 0.33% to 0.27% in 2014 compared to 2015. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities were $356,052,000 (or $180,000 and 0.1% higher) in 2015 compared to $355,872,000 in 2014. The higher balances had only a slight impact on the overall interest expense.\n 36 \n \nInterest expense was $322,000 (21.6%) lower in 2014 compared to 2013, decreasing from $1,490,000 to $1,168,000. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities was 1.9% higher in 2014 ($355,872,000) compared to 2013 ($349,329,000). The slightly higher balances, however, did not increase interest expense as the increases occurred in lower cost checking and savings accounts, which were slightly offset by decreases in higher cost time deposits and other borrowings. Despite the increase in average interest bearing balances the Company experienced a decrease in interest expense of $95,000 due to this increase in interest checking and money market balances offset by the decrease in time deposits and other borrowings. The overall decrease in interest expense was also due to lower rates, which accounted for a $227,000 decrease in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013. Rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 10 basis points from 0.43% in 2013 to 0.33% in 2014.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses.

As a result of the improving credit quality over the past several years and a reduction in historical loan loss rates the Company did not require any loan or lease loss provision in 2015. As a result of the recoveries in 2014, the Company reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses by recording a negative provision for loan and lease losses of $541,000. The level of non-performing loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to $1,643,000 at December 31, 2015. For additional information see the Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases.\u201d While the level of non-performing loans and leases has decreased, there remains a challenging economy in the Company's market areas and in the United States, in general. This may potentially negatively impact the Company's borrowers and as a result the Company has maintained the ALLL at a level that is higher than the long-term historical averages.

The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to lower fees from service charges on deposit accounts (down $64,000 or 11.4%) and no life insurance death benefits in 2015 as compared to $99,000 in 2014. The decrease in service charges is related to a decrease in insufficient funds income.\nNoninterest income increased $162,000 (8.0%) to $2,177,000 in 2014 from the 2013 level. The increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily related to income from security sales which increased from $36,000 in 2013 to $208,000 in 2014. In addition, rental income from OREO properties increased from $316,000 in 2013 to $365,000 in 2014.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $8,528,000 (down $248,000 or 2.8%) for 2015 as compared to $8,776,000 in 2014. The decrease in salary and benefits was due in part to lower incentive compensation expense and lower employee benefits. Incentive accruals decreased $182,000, from $672,000 in 2014 to $490,000 in 2015 and other employee benefits decreased $107,000 (7.0%) from $1,529,000 in 2014 to $1,422,000 in 2015. The decrease in incentive compensation was primarily due to the Company not reaching all of the incentive targets in 2015. The decrease in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to lower employee placement fees paid in 2015.\nSalaries and benefits were $8,776,000 (up $260,000 or 3.1%) for 2014 as compared to $8,516,000 in 2013. The increase in salary and benefits was due in part to increased incentive compensation expense and higher employee benefits partially offset by a decrease in core salaries. Incentive accruals increased $54,000, from $618,000 in 2013 to $672,000 in 2014 and other employee benefits increased $162,000 (11.9%) from $1,367,000 in 2013 to $1,529,000 in 2014. Salaries decreased $66,000 (1.1%) from $6,048,000 in 2013 to $5,982,000 in 2014. The increase in incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the Company's net income in relationship to incentive targeted net income goals. The increase in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to higher employee placement fees paid in 2014 to attract lending officers and a chief credit officer. The decrease in salaries is related to a lower number of employees. Average full-time equivalent employees decreased from 106 during 2013 to 102 during 2014.\n 40 \n \nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2015 was $322,000 (down $42,000 or 11.5%) compared to $364,000 in 2014. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower property write-downs. In 2015, write-downs were $76,000 compared to $165,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2015 totaled $245,000 compared to $430,000 in 2014. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2015. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to a loss of $1,000 in 2015.\nThe total OREO expense in 2014 was $364,000 (down $572,000 or 61.1%) compared to $936,000 in 2013. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower write-downs due to updated property valuations. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2013. In 2014, write-downs were $165,000 compared to $293,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to $44,000 in 2013 and operating expenses on the properties held in 2014 totaled $430,000 compared to $686,000 in 2013.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $5,000 (0.4%) during 2015 to $1,183,000, compared to $1,188,000 in 2014. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.7%) during 2015 to $690,000 compared to $724,000 in 2014. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nOccupancy expense decreased $24,000 (2.0%) during 2014 to $1,188,000, compared to $1,212,000 in 2013. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.5%) during 2014 to $724,000 compared to $758,000 in 2013. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $39,000 (10.7%) during 2015 to $324,000, compared to $363,000 in 2014. The majority of this decrease relates to a lower assessment rate as a result of lower nonperforming assets. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2015 were $71,000 compared to $70,000 in 2014.\nFDIC assessments increased $51,000 (16.3%) during 2014 to $363,000, compared to $312,000 in 2013. The majority of this increase relates to an adjustment to the accrual based upon an updated analysis performed in 2013 revealing that the accrual should be reduced. This adjustment occurred in 2013 and did not reoccur in 2014. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2014 were $70,000, no change from 2013.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>933 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outsourced item processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors' expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>348 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Telephone and postage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>329 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stationery and supplies </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising and promotion </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,087 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 41 \n \nOther expenses were $2,962,000 (down $415,000 or 12.3%) for 2015 as compared to $3,377,000 for 2014. The decrease in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses, which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional services, decreased $319,000 (27.0%), from $1,182,000 in 2014 to $863,000 in 2015. Legal expenses decreased $255,000 (61.6%) from $414,000 in 2014 to $255,000 during 2015. This decrease is primarily related to a lower number of problem loan credits and OREO properties. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2015 was 62.9% as compared to 70.0% in 2014.\nOther expenses were $3,377,000 (up $290,000 or 9.4%) for 2014 as compared to $3,087,000 for 2013. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses increased $249,000 (26.7%), from $933,000 in 2013 to $1,182,000 in 2014. Legal expenses increased $182,000 (78.4%) from $232,000 in 2013 to $414,000 during 2014. This increase is primarily related to problem loan credits and the resolution of issues associated with a former OREO property. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2014 was 70.0% as compared to 75.6% in 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 33.7%, 34.5%, and 29.2% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $516,000, $419,000, and $197,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,412,000, $1,194,000, and $1,213,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher level of income taxes and effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted from the Company realizing significantly less benefits of Enterprise Zone credits on our State tax return as the program has been significantly reduced and an increase in taxable income in 2014. Taxable income increased from $4,315,000 in 2013 to $6,653,000 in 2014.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $634,640,000 at December 31, 2015 as compared to $617,754,000 at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $16,886,000 (2.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2015 were $623,049,000, up $17,802,000 or 2.9% from the 2014 total of $605,247,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so.

At December 31, 2015, these categories accounted for approximately 12%, 68%, 8%, 5%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 1%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio. This mix was relatively unchanged compared to 10%, 73%, 5%, 3%, 5%, 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. Continuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $80 million in new loans in 2015. This production was partially offset by normal pay downs and payoffs, but still resulted in an overall net increase in net loans and leases of $31.0 million (12.0%) from December 31, 2014. The market in which the Company operates has begun to show demand for credit products as the continued low rate environment and expectations for economic expansion have increased refinancing as well as new loan activity. The Company reported net increases in balances for commercial loans ($11,009,000 or 43.7%), commercial real estate ($5,720,000 or 3.0%), multi-family real estate ($9,327,000 or 65.8%), real estate construction ($6,505,000 or 81.0%), and residential real estate ($891,000 or 6.7%), and decreases in lease financing receivable ($554,000 or 43.1), agriculture ($451,000 or 15.6%), and consumer loans ($1,794,000 or 36.5%).

The Company relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by American River Bank officers, directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions. The Company makes loans and leases to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose and a viable primary repayment source, generally supported by a secondary source of repayment.\nCommercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs and working capital and loans for equipment or vehicle purchases. Consumer loans include traditional consumer products such as secured and unsecured personal loans and loans to finance the purchase of autos, boats and recreational vehicles. Construction loans are generally comprised of commitments to customers within the Company's service area for construction of owner-occupied commercial properties. Other real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by first trust deeds on commercial or multi-family properties, typically with maturities from 3 to 10 years and original loan-to-value ratios generally from 65% to 75%. In general, except in the case of loans under SBA programs, the Company does not make long-term mortgage loans.\n 43 \n \nSubprime\u201d real estate loans generally refer to residential mortgages made to higher-risk borrowers with lower credit and/or income histories. Within the banking industry, many of these loans were originated with adjustable interest rates that reset upward after an introductory period. These subprime\u201d loans coupled with declines in housing prices led to an increase in default rates resulting in many instances of increased foreclosure rates as the adjustable interest rates reset to higher levels. The Company did not have any such subprime\u201d loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAverage loans and leases in 2015 were $279,728,000 which represents an increase of $25,830,000 (10.2%) compared to the average in 2014. Average loans and leases in 2014 were $253,898,000 which represents an increase of $1,091,000 (0.4%) compared to the average in 2013.\nRisk Elements\nThe Company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality, extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies. Additionally, the Company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio. Management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the Company's loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth. Management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process, through active credit administration and regular monitoring. With this in mind, management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.\nUltimately, underlying trends in economic and business cycles influence credit quality. American River Bank's business is concentrated in the Sacramento Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a diversified economy, but with a large State of California government presence and employment base; in Sonoma County, which is focused on businesses within the two communities in which the Bank has offices (Santa Rosa and Healdsburg); and in Amador County, in which the Bank is primarily focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices (Jackson, Pioneer, and Ione). The economy of Sonoma County is diversified with professional services, manufacturing, agriculture and real estate investment and construction, while the economy of Amador County is reliant upon government, services, retail trade, manufacturing industries and Indian gaming. The Company has recently entered the Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda County markets with loan productions offices in San Ramon and San Jose. The economies of Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties are diversified with professional services, manufacturing, technology related companies, real estate investment and construction.\nThe Company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate. The ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate. The Company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans. The more significant factors management considers involve the following: lease rates and terms, vacancy rates, absorption and sale rates and capitalization rates; real estate values, supply and demand factors, and rates of return; operating expenses; inflation and deflation; and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including, in some instances, personal guarantees.\nIn extending credit and commitments to borrowers, the Company generally requires collateral and/or guarantees as security. The repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. The Company's requirement for collateral and/or guarantees is determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with management's evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing properties, residences and other real property. The Company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets, obtaining deeds of trust, or outright possession among other means.\nIn management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately 86% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 87% at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the residential land portion of the Company's loan portfolio carries more than the normal credit risk, due primarily to curtailed demand for new and resale residential property, relative to pre-recession levels, a resulting oversupply of unsold residential land, and observed reductions in values throughout the Company's market area. Management has responded by evaluating loans that it considers to carry any significant risk above the normal risk of collectability by taking actions where possible to reduce credit risk exposure by methods that include, but are not limited to, seeking liquidation of the loan by the borrower, seeking additional tangible collateral or other repayment support, converting the property through judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, and other collection techniques. Management currently believes that it maintains its allowance for loan and lease losses at levels adequate to reflect the loss risk inherent in its total loan portfolio.\n 44 \n \nA decline in the economy in general, or decline in real estate values in the Company's primary market areas, in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of real estate loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. This could adversely affect the Company's future prospects, results of operations, profitability and stock price. Management believes that its lending practices and underwriting standards are structured with the intent to minimize losses; however, there is no assurance that losses will not occur. The Company's loan practices and underwriting standards include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) maintaining a thorough understanding of the Company's service area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area, (2) maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers' knowledge, capacity, and market position in their field of expertise, (3) basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project, but also on the borrowers' capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations (whether sale or income performance), and (4) maintaining conforming and prudent loan-to-value and loan-to-cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the Company's lending officers or contracted third-party professionals.\nNonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases\nManagement places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or if a loss is expected, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases are partially or fully charged off when, in the opinion of management, collection of such amount appears unlikely.\nThe recorded investments in non-performing loans and leases, which includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases that were 90 days or more past due and on accrual, totaled $1,643,000 and $1,653,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $1,643,000 in non-performing loans and leases at December 31, 2015, there were four real estate loans totaling $1,493,000, four consumer loans totaling $120,000 and a single commercial loan totaling $30,000. At December 31, 2014, the $1,653,000 in non-performing loans consisted of three real estate loans totaling $845,000; two commercial loans totaling $666,000 and three consumer loans totaling $142,000.\nThe net interest due on nonaccrual loans and leases but excluded from interest income was approximately $145,000 during 2015, $116,000 during 2014, and $327,000 during 2013. Interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases was approximately $59,000 in 2015, $84,000 in 2014 and $161,000 in 2013. Table Eight below sets forth nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases past due 90 days or more and on accrual as of year-end for the past five years.\nTable Eight: Non-Performing Loans and Leases\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Past due 90 days or more and still accruing: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease financing receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nonaccrual: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,775 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease financing receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>822 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing loans and leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere were no loan or lease concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans and leases not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases as of December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any potential problem loans, which were accruing and current at December 31, 2015, where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms and that would result in a significant loss to the Company apart from those loans identified in the Bank's impairment analysis.\n 45 \n \nManagement monitors the Company's performance metrics including the ratios related to non-performing loans and leases. From 2008 to 2010, the Company experienced an increase in non-performing loans and leases. In 2011, the focused efforts of the previous years resulted in a decrease in these levels. In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the level of non-performing loans and leases continued to decrease to a level below the amount reported at December 31, 2008. However, the variations in the amount of non-performing loans and leases does not directly impact the level of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses as management monitors each of the loans and leases for loss potential or probability of loss on an individual basis using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nImpaired Loans and Leases\nThe Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. The measurement of impairment may be based on (i) the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or lease discounted at the loan's or lease's original effective interest rate, (ii) the observable market price of the impaired loan or lease, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral-dependent loan. The Company does not apply this definition to smaller-balance loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for credit risk. In assessing whether a loan or lease is impaired, the Company typically reviews loans or leases graded substandard or lower with outstanding principal balances in excess of $100,000, as well as loans considered troubled debt restructures with outstanding principal balances in excess of $25,000. The Company identifies troubled debt restructures by reviewing each renewal, modification, or extension of a loan with a screening document. This document is designed to identify any characteristics of such a loan that would qualify it as a troubled debt restructure. If the characteristics are not present that would qualify a loan as a troubled debt restructure, it is deemed to be a modification.\nThe recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $21,365,000 at December 31, 2015 and had a related valuation allowance of $899,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2015 was approximately $20,818,000. As of December 31, 2014, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $25,120,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,603,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2014 was approximately $24,127,000. As of December 31, 2013, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $27,034,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,598,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2013 was approximately $27,975,000.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, which is based upon management's estimate of those losses. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge-offs. Actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process. The model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management's judgment after consideration of numerous factors including, but not limited to: (i) local and regional economic conditions, (ii) the financial condition of the borrowers, (iii) loan impairment and the related level of expected charge-offs, (iv) evaluation of industry trends, (v) industry and other concentrations, (vi) loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management, (vii) continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio, (viii) ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential, (ix) quarterly review by the Board of Directors, and (x) assessments by banking regulators and other third parties. Management and the Board of Directors evaluate the ALLL and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures, such as knowledge of the borrowers' business, valuation of collateral, the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses.\n 46 \n \nThe ALLL totaled $4,975,000 or 1.69% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2015, $5,301,000 or 2.01% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2014, and $5,346,000 or 2.08% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses from $5,346,000 at December 31, 2013 to $4,975,000 at December 31, 2015, was mainly due to a decrease in historical losses impacting the loss factor used in calculating the reserve on loans collectively valued for impairment. The Company establishes general and specific reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The ALLL is composed of categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating; however, the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses. While management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on changes in economic conditions and other matters. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's ALLL. Such agencies may require the Company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases was 302.8% at December 31, 2015 and 320.7% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of impaired loans and leases was 23.3% at December 31, 2015 and 21.1% at December 31, 2014. Of the total non-performing and impaired loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2015, there were $4,757,000 in loans or leases that had been reduced by partial charge-offs of $816,000.\nAt December 31, 2015, there was $12,607,000 in impaired loans or leases that did not carry a specific reserve. Of this amount, $3,900,000 were loans or leases that had previous partial charge-offs and $8,707,000 in loans or leases that were analyzed and determined not to require a specific reserve or charge-off because the collateral value or discounted cash flow value exceeded the loan or lease balance. Prior to 2013, the Company had been operating in a market that had experienced significant decreases in real estate values of commercial, residential, land, and construction properties. As such, the Company continues to focus on monitoring collateral values for those loans considered collateral dependent. The collateral evaluations performed by the Company are updated as necessary, which is generally once every twelve months, and are reviewed by a qualified credit officer.\nThe Company's policy with regard to loan or lease charge-offs continues to be that a loan or lease is charged off against the ALLL when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. As previously discussed in the Impaired Loans and Leases\u201d section, certain loans are evaluated for impairment. Generally, if a loan is collateralized by real estate, and considered collateral dependent, the impaired portion will be charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses unless it is in the process of collection, in which case a specific reserve may be warranted. If the collateral is other than real estate and considered impaired, a specific reserve may be warranted.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Formula allocations are calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Historical loss factors are based upon the Company's loss experience. These historical loss factors are adjusted for changes in the business cycle and for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. The discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is prudent and adequate. However, no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company made a specific enhancement to its methodology for determining the general reserve component of the ALLL. The enhancement related specifically to the methodology used to calculate the qualitative factors with respect to non-impaired loans graded watch, special mention and substandard by eliminating the use of multipliers. The ALLL methodology was also revised to add an additional qualitative factor, by loan grade, in calculating the general reserve component of the ALLL. Management believes that the allocation of the ALLL to each loan risk grade, within each loan type has become more precise under the methodology enhancement. The implementation of the ALLL model revision did not have a material impact on the calculation of the required allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015.\n 47 \n \nTable Nine below

allocated to each loan and lease category represents the total amounts available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance in OREO at December 31, 2015 consisted of three properties acquired through foreclosure. The balance in OREO at December 31, 2014 consisted of seven properties. During 2015, the Company received $1,153,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of four OREO properties with net losses of $1,000 in the aggregate recognized on these sales and, prior to sale, there was a write-down of $156,000 to the OREO allowance and $76,000 to expense on two of the four properties. Furthermore, there were capitalized costs of $126,000 on a single existing property. There was $3,551,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 with no valuation allowance and $4,803,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2014 with a valuation allowance of $156,000.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2015, total deposits were $530,690,000 representing an increase of $19,997,000 (3.9%) from the December 31, 2014 balance of $510,693,000. The Company's deposit growth plan for 2015 was to concentrate its efforts on increasing noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing money market and interest-bearing checking, and savings accounts, while continuing to focus on reducing overall interest expense. Due to these efforts, the Company experienced increases during 2015 in noninterest-bearing demand ($34,850,000 or 22.4%), interest-bearing checking ($462,000 or 0.8%), and savings ($241,000 or 0.4%) and decreases in money market ($12,439,000 or 8.4%) and time deposit ($3,117,000 or 3.6%) accounts. The decrease in money market accounts is related to the plan to reduce interest expense as the Company evaluated the rate structure on some of the higher cost money market accounts and reduced the interest rates on some relationships.\n 49 \n \nOther Borrowed Funds\n\tOther borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB\u201d). The following table summarizes these borrowings (dollars in thousands):\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Short-term borrowings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FHLB advances </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term borrowings: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FHLB advances </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe maximum amount of short-term borrowings at any month-end during 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $11,500,000, $3.500,000, and $8,000,000, respectively. The FHLB advances are collateralized by loans and securities pledged to the FHLB. The following is a breakdown of rates and maturities on FHLB advances (dollars in thousands):\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Short-term </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Long-term </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 to 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has the ability to enter into letters of credit with the FHLB. There were no letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2015 or 2014. There were no draws upon any letter of credit in 2015 or 2014 and management does not expect to draw upon these sources of liquidity in the foreseeable future.\nCapital Resources\nThe current and projected capital position of the Company and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company's capital position represents the level of capital available to support continuing operations and expansion.\nOn January 17, 2014, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2014 (the 2014 Program\u201d). The 2014 Program authorized the repurchase during 2014 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. During 2014, the Company repurchased 424,462 shares of its common stock at an average price of $9.77 per share. On January 21, 2015, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2015 (the 2015 Program\u201d). The 2015 Program authorized the repurchase during 2015 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, on July 15, 2015, the Company approved and authorized an additional amount of 5% to be purchased under the 2015 Program. During 2015, the Company repurchased 790,989 shares of its common stock at an average price of $9.92 per share. On January 20, 2016, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2016 (the 2016 Program\u201d). The 2016 Program authorized the repurchase during 2016 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, or approximately 367,182 shares based on the 7,343,649 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Any repurchases under the 2016 Program will be made from time to time by the Company in the open market as conditions allow. All such transactions will be structured to comply with Commission Rule 10b-18 and all shares repurchased under the 2016 Program will be retired. The number, price and timing of the repurchases will be at the Company's sole discretion and the 2016 Program may be re-evaluated depending on market conditions, capital and liquidity needs or other factors. Based on such re-evaluation, the Board of Directors may suspend, terminate, modify or cancel the 2016 Program at any time without notice.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares in 2011 or 2010 and repurchased 575,389 shares in 2012 and 849,404 shares in 2013. Share amounts have been adjusted for stock dividends and/or splits. See Part II, Item 5, Stock Repurchases\u201d for more information regarding stock repurchases.\nThe Company and American River Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and American River Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the most recent regulatory notification categorized American River Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action plan. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's categories.\n 50 \n \nAt December 31, 2015, shareholders' equity was $86,075,000, representing a decrease of $3,572,000 (5.1%) from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014. The decrease resulted from a decrease in other comprehensive income of $1,268,000 as a result of the decrease in the unrealized gain on securities due to an increase in interest rates, additions from net income of $5,269,000 for the period and the stock based compensation of $271,000, offset by repurchases of common stock of $7,843,000. In 2014, shareholders' equity increased $2,627,000 (3.0%) from $87,020,000 at December 31, 2013. The increase resulted from the additions from net income for the period, an increase in other comprehensive income, and an increase in stock based compensation exceeding the repurchases of common stock.\nTable Eleven below lists the Company's actual capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as well as the minimum capital ratios for capital adequacy.\nTable Eleven: Capital Ratios\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Regulatory </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital to Risk-Adjusted Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital Requirements </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leverage ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Risk-Based Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet future needs. At December 31, 2015, American River Bank's ratios were in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized.\u201d \tManagement believes that the Company's capital is adequate to support current operations and anticipated growth and currently foreseeable future capital requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revised and replaced the then current risk-based capital requirements in order to implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules included an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components and the calculation of risk-weighted assets.\nEffective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 Billion or more and banks like American River Bank were required to comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which would consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets ( leverage\u201d) ratio of 4%.\nIn addition, a capital conservation buffer,\u201d is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.\n 51 \n \nMarket Risk Management\nOverview. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan, investment and deposit functions. The goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the Company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the Company to undue interest rate risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies. The Company has an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, made up of Company management that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates.\nAsset/Liability Management. Activities involved in asset/liability management include but are not limited to lending, accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset/liability management. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates. The asset/liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments. The Company uses simulation models to forecast earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity.\nSimulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes. Using computer-modeling techniques, with specialized software built for this specific purpose for financial institutions, the Company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity. A balance sheet is prepared using detailed inputs of actual loans, securities and interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. deposits/borrowings). The balance sheet is processed using multiple interest rate scenarios. The scenarios include a rising rate forecast, a flat rate forecast and a falling rate forecast which take place within a one-year time frame. The net interest income is measured over a one and a two year periods assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve-month horizon. The simulation modeling attempts to estimate changes in the Company's net interest income utilizing a detailed current balance sheet.\nAfter a review of the model results as of December 31, 2015, the Company does not consider the fluctuations from the base case, to have a material impact on the Company's projected results and are within the tolerance levels outlined in the Company's interest rate risk polices. The simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions, which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations. Therefore, they do not reflect likely actual results, but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing or maturity. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons. The differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps. A positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position. An asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to expand. This results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time. Conversely, a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect. A negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position. A liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to contract, while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing, or other commercial concerns, primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary. In general, inflation primarily affects the Company through its effect on market rates of interest, which affects the Company's ability to attract loan customers. Inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand, and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future. In addition to its effects on interest rates, inflation increases overall operating expenses. Inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n 52 \n \nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients. Both assets and liabilities contribute to the Company's liquidity position. Federal funds lines, short-term investments and securities, and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity, along with deposit increases, while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity. The Company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns, current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs. Commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were approximately $26,730,000 and $238,000, respectively. Such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe Company's sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks, overnight funds sold to correspondent banks, unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale. On December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets totaled $229.7 million or 36.2% of total assets compared to $234.7 million or 38.0% of total assets on December 31, 2014. In addition to liquid assets, the Company maintains short-term lines of credit in the amount of $17,000,000 with two of its correspondent banks. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $17,000,000 available under these credit lines. Additionally, American River Bank is a member of the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, American River Bank could have arranged for up to $89,326,000 in secured borrowings from the FHLB. These borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $78,326,000 available under these secured borrowing arrangements. American River Bank also has a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank. The borrowing can be secured by pledging selected loans and investment securities. Based on the amount of assets pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2015, the Company's borrowing capacity was $11,371,000.\nThe Company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and, as such, its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations. Accordingly, management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits.\nLiquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities. The Company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available-for-sale category to meet liquidity needs. These securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise. American River Bank can also pledge additional securities to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB.\nThe maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in Table Thirteen below for the period presented. These deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and, therefore, are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>Table Thirteen: Certificates of Deposit Maturities </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than $250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over $250,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three months through six months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,312 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over six months through twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over twelve months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,744 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan and lease demand also affects the Company's liquidity position.

The yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis. Yields may not represent actual future income to be recorded. Timing of principal prepayments on mortgage-backed securities may increase or decrease depending on market factors and the borrowers' ability to make unscheduled principal payments. Fast prepayments on bonds that were purchased with a premium will result in a lower yield and slower prepayments on premium bonds will result in a higher yield, the opposite would be true for bonds purchased at a discount. Table Fifteen does not include FHLB Stock, which does not have stated maturity dates or readily available market values. The balance in FHLB Stock at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $3,779,000, $3,686,000 and $3,248,000, respectively.\nTable Fifteen: Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\nTable 247:

at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The carrying values of held-to-maturity securities do not include unrealized gains or losses; however, the net unrecognized gains at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $46,000, $60,000 and $78,000, respectively.\n 54 \n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2015, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options or similar instruments. At origination, real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% to 75%. In addition, the majority of the Company's commitments have variable interest rates. The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commitments to extend credit (dollars in thousands): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residences </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial real estate, construction and land development commitments secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other unused commitments, principally commercial loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,986 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles ( SPV\u201d) to dispose of problem assets. The SPV is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent corporation goes bankrupt. Under certain circumstances, these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and non-performing assets. The Company does not use those vehicles or any other structures to dispose of problem assets.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company leases certain facilities at which it conducts its operations. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are noted in Table Sixteen below. Table Sixteen below presents certain of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Included in the table are amounts payable under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, Deferred Fees Plan and salary continuation agreements listed in the Other Long-Term Liabilities...\u201d category. At December 31, 2015, these amounts represented $4,089,000 most of which is anticipated to be primarily payable at least five years in the future.\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>Table Sixteen: Contractual Obligations </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-Term Debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of Deposit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company's Balance Sheet under GAAP </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,633 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 55 \n \nAccounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued FASB Accounting Standards Update (the Update\u201d) 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure. Under this Update, FASB amended existing guidance to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. These amendments clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either:\n(1)\t the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or\n(2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.\nThe amendments in this Update were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effects of adopting this Update did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This Update requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments within this update are effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update, but does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Update 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10). Under this Update, FASB enhanced the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This Update contains several provisions, including but not limited to 1) require equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) eliminated the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value; and 4) require separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n 56 \n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\t Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including, but not limited to, matters described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may contain words related to future projections including, but not limited to, words such as believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d would,\u201d and variations of those words and similar words that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the legislation promulgated by the United States Congress and actions taken by governmental agencies, including the United States Department of the Treasury, to deal with challenges to the U.S. financial system; (2) the risks presented by economic volatility and recession, which could adversely affect credit quality, collateral values, including real estate collateral, investment values, liquidity and loan originations and loan portfolio delinquency rates; (3) variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets and return on assets; (4) potential loan and lease losses; (5) potential expenses associated with resolving non-performing assets as well as regulatory changes; (6) changes in the interest rate environment including interest rates charged on loans, earned on securities investments and paid on deposits and other borrowed funds; (7) competitive effects; (8) potential declines in fee and other noninterest income earned associated with economic factors as well as regulatory changes; (9) general economic conditions nationally, regionally, and within our operating markets could be less favorable than expected or could have a more direct and pronounced effect on us than expected and adversely affect our ability to continue internal growth at historical rates and maintain the quality of our earning assets; (10) changes in the regulatory environment including increased capital and regulatory compliance requirements and further government intervention in the U.S. financial system; (11) changes in business conditions and inflation; (12) changes in securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets; (13) potential data processing, cybersecurity and other operational systems failures, breach or fraud; (14) potential decline in real estate values in our operating markets; (15) the effects of uncontrollable events such as terrorism, the threat of terrorism or the impact of military conflicts in connection with the conduct of the war on terrorism by the United States and its allies, negative financial and economic conditions, natural disasters, and disruption of power supplies and communications; (16) changes in accounting standards, tax laws or regulations and interpretations of such standards, laws or regulations; (17) projected business increases following any future strategic expansion could be lower than expected; (18) the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions could become impaired, which may have an adverse impact on our earnings; (19) the reputation of the financial services industry could experience further deterioration, which could adversely affect our ability to access markets for funding and to acquire and retain customers; and (20) the efficiencies we may expect to receive from any investments in personnel and infrastructure may not be realized.\nThe factors set forth under Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d in this report and other cautionary statements and information set forth in this report should be carefully considered and understood as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements contained in this report, when evaluating the business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. By their nature, they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future results and shareholder values may differ significantly from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Any such statement speaks only as of the date of this report, and in the case of any documents that may be incorporated by reference, as of the date of those documents. We do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report any new information, future event or other circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. However, your attention is directed to any further disclosures made on related subjects in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K.\n 33 \n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. We use historical loss data and the economic environment as factors, among others, in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Company's credit portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (1) Accounting for Contingencies,\u201d which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that a loss has occurred at the balance sheet date and such loss can be reasonably estimated; and (2) the Receivables\u201d topic, which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk, loss events, or changes in other factors, occur. The analysis of the allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the actual losses incurred in the future. If the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below that deemed adequate (by reason of loan and lease growth, actual losses, the effect of changes in risk factors, or some combination of these), the Company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses, over the short-term. For further information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense over the service period in an amount equal to the fair value of all share-based payments which consist of stock options and restricted stock awarded to directors and employees. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant and amortized over the service period using a Black-Scholes-Merton based option valuation model that requires the use of assumptions. Critical assumptions that affect the estimated fair value of each award include expected stock price volatility, dividend yields, option life and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each restricted award is estimated on the date of award and amortized over the service period.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations involving the Company's acquisition of equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company's ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. At December 31, 2015, the Company's reporting unit had positive equity and the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries. The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity's proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.\n 34 \n \nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the balance sheet method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. On the consolidated balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company conducted an analysis to assess the need for a valuation allowance at December 31, 2015, and determined that no valuation allowance was required. As part of this assessment, all available evidence, including both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether based on the weight of such evidence, a valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets was needed. A valuation allowance is deemed to be needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The future realization of the deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carry forward periods.\nThe benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized. The election has been made to record interest expense related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable, and the exposure for penalties related to tax exposures in tax expense, if applicable.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income in 2015 of $5,268,000, an increase of $907,000 (20.8%) from $4,361,000 in 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.70 for 2015 and $0.54 for 2014. For 2015, the Company realized a return on average equity of 6.03% and a return on average assets of 0.85%, as compared to 4.98% and 0.72%, respectively, in 2014.\nNet income for 2014 increased $1,304,000 (42.7%) from $3,057,000 in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $0.34. For 2013, the Company realized a return on average equity of 3.38% and return on average assets of 0.52%. Table One below provides a summary of the components of net income for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable One: Components of Net Income\n\n* Fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE)\n\tUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America all share and per share data is adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits. There were no stock dividends or stock splits in 2015, 2014 or 2013.\n 35 \n \nDuring 2015, total assets of the Company increased $16,886,000 (2.7%) from $617,754,000 at December 31, 2014 to $634,640,000 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, net loans totaled $289,102,000, up $31,045,000 (12.0%) from the ending balance of $258,057,000 at December 31, 2014. Deposits increased $19,997,000 or 3.9% from $510,693,000 at December 31, 2014 to $530,690,000 at December 31, 2015. Shareholders' equity decreased $3,572,000 or 4.0% from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014 to $86,075,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company ended 2015 with a leverage capital ratio of 11.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 20.6% compared to a leverage capital ratio of 11.6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 22.9% at the end of 2014.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets (loans, securities, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in other banks) over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets.\nThe Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.63% in 2015, 3.54% in 2014, and 3.45% in 2013. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,312,000 (6.9%), from $19,067,000 in 2014 to $20,379,000 in 2015. The fully taxable equivalent net interest income was up $1,387,000 (7.8%), from $17,680,000 in 2013 to $19,067,000 in 2014.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased $1,098,000 (5.4%) from $20,242,000 in 2014 to $21,340,000 in 2015. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is comprised of two components - rate (down $285,000) and volume (up $1,383,000). The rate decrease primarily occurred in the loan portfolio. While average loans increased by $25,830,000 (10.2%) from $253,898,000 during 2014 to $279,728,000 during 2015, due to the overall lower interest rate environment, the new loans added were at lower yields than the existing loans. Yield on loans decreased from 5.37% in 2014 to 5.01% in 2015 and contributed a decrease of $1,076,000 in loan interest income. The decrease of $1,076,000 in interest income created from the decrease in rates on the loan balances was partially offset by an increase in rates on the investment portfolio resulting in an increase of $790,000 related to the investments. This increase in investment income due to rates can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. The volume increase of $1,383,000 was primarily from the increase in average loans mentioned above ($1,466,000) and partially offset by a decrease in investments ($83,000). When compared to 2014, average investment securities decreased $3,092,000 (1.1%) from $284,436,000 in 2014 compared to $281,344,000 in 2015.\nThe fully taxable equivalent interest income component increased from $19,170,000 in 2013 to $20,235,000 in 2014, representing a 5.6% increase. The increase in the fully taxable equivalent interest income for 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is comprised of two components - rate (up $591,000) and volume (up $474,000). The rate increase primarily occurred in the investment portfolio which can be attributed to a slowdown in the mortgage refinance market. As mortgage refinancing slows it also reduces the principal prepayments that the Company receives on the mortgage backed securities, which reduces the premium amounts amortized on the bonds. A lower amount of amortized premium results in higher interest income. Investment securities added $1,211,000 in additional interest income related to rate. The average yield on investments increased from 1.93% in 2013 to 2.32% in 2014. The increase in interest income created from the investment portfolio was partially offset by a decrease in rates on the loan balances. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.61% to 5.37% and was caused by principal reductions from normal payments and paydowns from loans being loaned out at lower market rates. The volume increase of $474,000 was also primarily related to the investments. Average investment balances were up $26,273,000 (10.2%) from $258,164,000 in 2013 to $284,436,000 in 2014. Funds received from the increase in deposit balances were primarily deployed in the investment portfolio.\nInterest expense was $207,000 (17.7%) lower in 2015 compared to 2014, decreasing from $1,168,000 to $961,000. The primary decrease in interest expense relates to lower rates (down $222,000). Rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased 6 basis points from 0.33% to 0.27% in 2014 compared to 2015. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities were $356,052,000 (or $180,000 and 0.1% higher) in 2015 compared to $355,872,000 in 2014. The higher balances had only a slight impact on the overall interest expense.\n 36 \n \nInterest expense was $322,000 (21.6%) lower in 2014 compared to 2013, decreasing from $1,490,000 to $1,168,000. The average balances on interest bearing liabilities was 1.9% higher in 2014 ($355,872,000) compared to 2013 ($349,329,000). The slightly higher balances, however, did not increase interest expense as the increases occurred in lower cost checking and savings accounts, which were slightly offset by decreases in higher cost time deposits and other borrowings. Despite the increase in average interest bearing balances the Company experienced a decrease in interest expense of $95,000 due to this increase in interest checking and money market balances offset by the decrease in time deposits and other borrowings. The overall decrease in interest expense was also due to lower rates, which accounted for a $227,000 decrease in interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013. Rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 10 basis points from 0.43% in 2013 to 0.33% in 2014.\nTable Two, Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets, and Table Three, Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses, are provided to enable the reader to understand the components and past trends of the Company's interest income and expenses. Table Two provides an analysis of net interest margin on earning assets setting forth average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity; interest income earned and interest expense paid and average rates earned and paid; and the net interest margin on earning assets. Table Three sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense from changes in average asset and liability balances (volume), computed on a daily average basis, and changes in average interest rates.\n 37 \n \nTable Two: Analysis of Net Interest Margin on Earning Assets\n\n (1) Loan and lease interest includes loan and lease fees of $322,000, $307,000 and $119,000 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (2) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments that primarily relate to income on certain loans and securities that is exempt from federal income taxes. The effective federal statutory tax rate was 34% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. (3) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets. \n 38 \n \nTable Three: Analysis of Volume and Rate Changes on Net Interest Income and Expenses\nYear ended December 31, 2015 over 2014 (dollars in thousands)\nIncrease (decrease) in interest income and expense\ndue to change in:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 over 2013 (dollars in thousands)\nIncrease (decrease) in interest income and expense\ndue to change in:\n\n\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Company experienced net loan and lease losses of $326,000 or 0.12% of average loans and leases during 2015 compared to net loan and lease recoveries of $496,000 or 0.20% of average loans and leases during 2014. As a result of the improving credit quality over the past several years and a reduction in historical loan loss rates the Company did not require any loan or lease loss provision in 2015. As a result of the recoveries in 2014, the Company reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses by recording a negative provision for loan and lease losses of $541,000. The level of non-performing loans and leases, which began to increase during the economic cycle of 2007 through 2010, reached a high of $22,571,000 at December 31, 2010, but has decreased to $1,643,000 at December 31, 2015. For additional information see the Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases.\u201d While the level of non-performing loans and leases has decreased, there remains a challenging economy in the Company's market areas and in the United States, in general. This may potentially negatively impact the Company's borrowers and as a result the Company has maintained the ALLL at a level that is higher than the long-term historical averages. For additional information see the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity.\u201d\n 39 \n \nService Charges and Fees and Other Income\nTable Four below provides a summary of the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable Four: Components of Noninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income decreased $162,000 (7.4%) to $2,015,000 in 2015 from the 2014 level. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily related to lower fees from service charges on deposit accounts (down $64,000 or 11.4%) and no life insurance death benefits in 2015 as compared to $99,000 in 2014. The decrease in service charges is related to a decrease in insufficient funds income.\nNoninterest income increased $162,000 (8.0%) to $2,177,000 in 2014 from the 2013 level. The increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily related to income from security sales which increased from $36,000 in 2013 to $208,000 in 2014. In addition, rental income from OREO properties increased from $316,000 in 2013 to $365,000 in 2014.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $8,528,000 (down $248,000 or 2.8%) for 2015 as compared to $8,776,000 in 2014. The decrease in salary and benefits was due in part to lower incentive compensation expense and lower employee benefits. Incentive accruals decreased $182,000, from $672,000 in 2014 to $490,000 in 2015 and other employee benefits decreased $107,000 (7.0%) from $1,529,000 in 2014 to $1,422,000 in 2015. The decrease in incentive compensation was primarily due to the Company not reaching all of the incentive targets in 2015. The decrease in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to lower employee placement fees paid in 2015.\nSalaries and benefits were $8,776,000 (up $260,000 or 3.1%) for 2014 as compared to $8,516,000 in 2013. The increase in salary and benefits was due in part to increased incentive compensation expense and higher employee benefits partially offset by a decrease in core salaries. Incentive accruals increased $54,000, from $618,000 in 2013 to $672,000 in 2014 and other employee benefits increased $162,000 (11.9%) from $1,367,000 in 2013 to $1,529,000 in 2014. Salaries decreased $66,000 (1.1%) from $6,048,000 in 2013 to $5,982,000 in 2014. The increase in incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the Company's net income in relationship to incentive targeted net income goals. The increase in other employee benefits, which includes health care related benefits, 401(k) matching, and employee placement fees, was primarily related to higher employee placement fees paid in 2014 to attract lending officers and a chief credit officer. The decrease in salaries is related to a lower number of employees. Average full-time equivalent employees decreased from 106 during 2013 to 102 during 2014.\n 40 \n \nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe total other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense in 2015 was $322,000 (down $42,000 or 11.5%) compared to $364,000 in 2014. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower property write-downs. In 2015, write-downs were $76,000 compared to $165,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Operating expenses on the properties held in 2015 totaled $245,000 compared to $430,000 in 2014. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2015. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to a loss of $1,000 in 2015.\nThe total OREO expense in 2014 was $364,000 (down $572,000 or 61.1%) compared to $936,000 in 2013. The primary reason for the decrease in OREO related expenses is due to the sale of a number of properties, including office buildings which have high operating expenses and lower write-downs due to updated property valuations. In 2014, the gains on sale, which offset the overall OREO expense, were higher than in 2013. In 2014, write-downs were $165,000 compared to $293,000 in 2013. This decrease is related to a fewer number of owned properties and some stability in the real estate market. Gains from properties sold in 2014 totaled $231,000 compared to $44,000 in 2013 and operating expenses on the properties held in 2014 totaled $430,000 compared to $686,000 in 2013.\nOccupancy, Furniture and Equipment\nOccupancy expense decreased $5,000 (0.4%) during 2015 to $1,183,000, compared to $1,188,000 in 2014. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.7%) during 2015 to $690,000 compared to $724,000 in 2014. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nOccupancy expense decreased $24,000 (2.0%) during 2014 to $1,188,000, compared to $1,212,000 in 2013. Furniture and equipment expense decreased $34,000 (4.5%) during 2014 to $724,000 compared to $758,000 in 2013. The decrease in the furniture and equipment expense resulted from lower depreciation on the Company's furniture and equipment.\nRegulatory Assessments\nRegulatory assessments include fees paid to the California Department of Business Oversight (the DBO\u201d) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC\u201d). FDIC assessments decreased $39,000 (10.7%) during 2015 to $324,000, compared to $363,000 in 2014. The majority of this decrease relates to a lower assessment rate as a result of lower nonperforming assets. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2015 were $71,000 compared to $70,000 in 2014.\nFDIC assessments increased $51,000 (16.3%) during 2014 to $363,000, compared to $312,000 in 2013. The majority of this increase relates to an adjustment to the accrual based upon an updated analysis performed in 2013 revealing that the accrual should be reduced. This adjustment occurred in 2013 and did not reoccur in 2014. The assessments paid to the DBO in 2014 were $70,000, no change from 2013.\nOther Expenses\nTable Five below provides a summary of the components of the other noninterest expenses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\n 41 \n \nOther expenses were $2,962,000 (down $415,000 or 12.3%) for 2015 as compared to $3,377,000 for 2014. The decrease in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses, which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional services, decreased $319,000 (27.0%), from $1,182,000 in 2014 to $863,000 in 2015. Legal expenses decreased $255,000 (61.6%) from $414,000 in 2014 to $255,000 during 2015. This decrease is primarily related to a lower number of problem loan credits and OREO properties. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2015 was 62.9% as compared to 70.0% in 2014.\nOther expenses were $3,377,000 (up $290,000 or 9.4%) for 2014 as compared to $3,087,000 for 2013. The increase in other expenses occurred primarily in the professional expense category. Professional expenses increased $249,000 (26.7%), from $933,000 in 2013 to $1,182,000 in 2014. Legal expenses increased $182,000 (78.4%) from $232,000 in 2013 to $414,000 during 2014. This increase is primarily related to problem loan credits and the resolution of issues associated with a former OREO property. The overhead efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis for 2014 was 70.0% as compared to 75.6% in 2013.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on income was 33.7%, 34.5%, and 29.2% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense (net of federal tax effect) of $516,000, $419,000, and $197,000 in these years. Tax-exempt income of $1,412,000, $1,194,000, and $1,213,000 from investment securities, loans, and bank-owned life insurance in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate. The higher level of income taxes and effective tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted from the Company realizing significantly less benefits of Enterprise Zone credits on our State tax return as the program has been significantly reduced and an increase in taxable income in 2014. Taxable income increased from $4,315,000 in 2013 to $6,653,000 in 2014.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nThe Company's total assets were $634,640,000 at December 31, 2015 as compared to $617,754,000 at December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $16,886,000 (2.7%). The average balances of total assets during 2015 were $623,049,000, up $17,802,000 or 2.9% from the 2014 total of $605,247,000.\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. The Company's intent is to hold all securities classified as held-to-maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement asset/liability management strategies as part of our contingency funding plan and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors. Table Six below summarizes the values of the Company's investment securities held on December 31 of the years indicated. The Company did not have any investment securities classified as trading in any of the years indicated below.\nTable Six: Investment Securities Composition\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n 42 \n \nSee Table Fifteen, Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields,\u201d for a breakdown of the investment securities by maturity and the corresponding weighted average yields.\nLoans and Leases\nThe Company concentrates its lending activities in the following principal areas: (1) commercial; (2) commercial real estate; (3) multi-family real estate; (4) real estate construction (both commercial and residential); (5) residential real estate; (6) lease financing receivable; (7) agriculture; and (8) consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, these categories accounted for approximately 12%, 68%, 8%, 5%, 5%, 0%, 1% and 1%, respectively, of the Company's loan portfolio. This mix was relatively unchanged compared to 10%, 73%, 5%, 3%, 5%, 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. Continuing focus in the Company's market area, new borrowers developed through the Company's marketing efforts, and credit extensions expanded to existing borrowers resulted in the Company originating approximately $80 million in new loans in 2015. This production was partially offset by normal pay downs and payoffs, but still resulted in an overall net increase in net loans and leases of $31.0 million (12.0%) from December 31, 2014. The market in which the Company operates has begun to show demand for credit products as the continued low rate environment and expectations for economic expansion have increased refinancing as well as new loan activity. The Company reported net increases in balances for commercial loans ($11,009,000 or 43.7%), commercial real estate ($5,720,000 or 3.0%), multi-family real estate ($9,327,000 or 65.8%), real estate construction ($6,505,000 or 81.0%), and residential real estate ($891,000 or 6.7%), and decreases in lease financing receivable ($554,000 or 43.1), agriculture ($451,000 or 15.6%), and consumer loans ($1,794,000 or 36.5%). Table Seven below summarizes the composition of the loan and lease portfolio for the past five years as of December 31.\nTable Seven: Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition\n\nA significant portion of the Company's loans and leases are direct loans and leases made to individuals and local businesses. The Company relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by American River Bank officers, directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions. The Company makes loans and leases to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose and a viable primary repayment source, generally supported by a secondary source of repayment.\nCommercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs and working capital and loans for equipment or vehicle purchases. Consumer loans include traditional consumer products such as secured and unsecured personal loans and loans to finance the purchase of autos, boats and recreational vehicles. Construction loans are generally comprised of commitments to customers within the Company's service area for construction of owner-occupied commercial properties. Other real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by first trust deeds on commercial or multi-family properties, typically with maturities from 3 to 10 years and original loan-to-value ratios generally from 65% to 75%. In general, except in the case of loans under SBA programs, the Company does not make long-term mortgage loans.\n 43 \n \nSubprime\u201d real estate loans generally refer to residential mortgages made to higher-risk borrowers with lower credit and/or income histories. Within the banking industry, many of these loans were originated with adjustable interest rates that reset upward after an introductory period. These subprime\u201d loans coupled with declines in housing prices led to an increase in default rates resulting in many instances of increased foreclosure rates as the adjustable interest rates reset to higher levels. The Company did not have any such subprime\u201d loans at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAverage loans and leases in 2015 were $279,728,000 which represents an increase of $25,830,000 (10.2%) compared to the average in 2014. Average loans and leases in 2014 were $253,898,000 which represents an increase of $1,091,000 (0.4%) compared to the average in 2013.\nRisk Elements\nThe Company assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through a total credit culture that emphasizes excellent credit quality, extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies. Additionally, the Company contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically review the existing loan and lease portfolio. Management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the Company's loan and lease portfolio is critical for profitability and growth. Management strives to continue its emphasis on credit quality in the loan and lease approval process, through active credit administration and regular monitoring. With this in mind, management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan and lease review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.\nUltimately, underlying trends in economic and business cycles influence credit quality. American River Bank's business is concentrated in the Sacramento Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a diversified economy, but with a large State of California government presence and employment base; in Sonoma County, which is focused on businesses within the two communities in which the Bank has offices (Santa Rosa and Healdsburg); and in Amador County, in which the Bank is primarily focused on businesses within the three communities in which it has offices (Jackson, Pioneer, and Ione). The economy of Sonoma County is diversified with professional services, manufacturing, agriculture and real estate investment and construction, while the economy of Amador County is reliant upon government, services, retail trade, manufacturing industries and Indian gaming. The Company has recently entered the Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda County markets with loan productions offices in San Ramon and San Jose. The economies of Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties are diversified with professional services, manufacturing, technology related companies, real estate investment and construction.\nThe Company has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are secured by real estate. The ultimate repayment of these loans is generally dependent on personal or business cash flows or the sale or refinancing of the real estate. The Company monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans. The more significant factors management considers involve the following: lease rates and terms, vacancy rates, absorption and sale rates and capitalization rates; real estate values, supply and demand factors, and rates of return; operating expenses; inflation and deflation; and sufficiency of repayment sources independent of the real estate including, in some instances, personal guarantees.\nIn extending credit and commitments to borrowers, the Company generally requires collateral and/or guarantees as security. The repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. The Company's requirement for collateral and/or guarantees is determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with management's evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income-producing properties, residences and other real property. The Company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets, obtaining deeds of trust, or outright possession among other means.\nIn management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate loans which represented approximately 86% of the Company's loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2015 and 87% at December 31, 2014. Management believes that the residential land portion of the Company's loan portfolio carries more than the normal credit risk, due primarily to curtailed demand for new and resale residential property, relative to pre-recession levels, a resulting oversupply of unsold residential land, and observed reductions in values throughout the Company's market area. Management has responded by evaluating loans that it considers to carry any significant risk above the normal risk of collectability by taking actions where possible to reduce credit risk exposure by methods that include, but are not limited to, seeking liquidation of the loan by the borrower, seeking additional tangible collateral or other repayment support, converting the property through judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, and other collection techniques. Management currently believes that it maintains its allowance for loan and lease losses at levels adequate to reflect the loss risk inherent in its total loan portfolio.\n 44 \n \nA decline in the economy in general, or decline in real estate values in the Company's primary market areas, in particular, could have an adverse impact on the collectability of real estate loans and require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. This could adversely affect the Company's future prospects, results of operations, profitability and stock price. Management believes that its lending practices and underwriting standards are structured with the intent to minimize losses; however, there is no assurance that losses will not occur. The Company's loan practices and underwriting standards include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) maintaining a thorough understanding of the Company's service area and originating a significant majority of its loans within that area, (2) maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers' knowledge, capacity, and market position in their field of expertise, (3) basing real estate loan approvals not only on market demand for the project, but also on the borrowers' capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not perform to expectations (whether sale or income performance), and (4) maintaining conforming and prudent loan-to-value and loan-to-cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the Company's lending officers or contracted third-party professionals.\nNonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans and Leases\nManagement places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or if a loss is expected, unless the loan or lease is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases are partially or fully charged off when, in the opinion of management, collection of such amount appears unlikely.\nThe recorded investments in non-performing loans and leases, which includes nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases that were 90 days or more past due and on accrual, totaled $1,643,000 and $1,653,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $1,643,000 in non-performing loans and leases at December 31, 2015, there were four real estate loans totaling $1,493,000, four consumer loans totaling $120,000 and a single commercial loan totaling $30,000. At December 31, 2014, the $1,653,000 in non-performing loans consisted of three real estate loans totaling $845,000; two commercial loans totaling $666,000 and three consumer loans totaling $142,000.\nThe net interest due on nonaccrual loans and leases but excluded from interest income was approximately $145,000 during 2015, $116,000 during 2014, and $327,000 during 2013. Interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans and leases was approximately $59,000 in 2015, $84,000 in 2014 and $161,000 in 2013. Table Eight below sets forth nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases past due 90 days or more and on accrual as of year-end for the past five years.\nTable Eight: Non-Performing Loans and Leases\n\nThere were no loan or lease concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans and leases not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans and leases as of December 31, 2015. Management is not aware of any potential problem loans, which were accruing and current at December 31, 2015, where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms and that would result in a significant loss to the Company apart from those loans identified in the Bank's impairment analysis.\n 45 \n \nManagement monitors the Company's performance metrics including the ratios related to non-performing loans and leases. From 2008 to 2010, the Company experienced an increase in non-performing loans and leases. In 2011, the focused efforts of the previous years resulted in a decrease in these levels. In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the level of non-performing loans and leases continued to decrease to a level below the amount reported at December 31, 2008. However, the variations in the amount of non-performing loans and leases does not directly impact the level of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses as management monitors each of the loans and leases for loss potential or probability of loss on an individual basis using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nImpaired Loans and Leases\nThe Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. The measurement of impairment may be based on (i) the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or lease discounted at the loan's or lease's original effective interest rate, (ii) the observable market price of the impaired loan or lease, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral-dependent loan. The Company does not apply this definition to smaller-balance loans or leases that are collectively evaluated for credit risk. In assessing whether a loan or lease is impaired, the Company typically reviews loans or leases graded substandard or lower with outstanding principal balances in excess of $100,000, as well as loans considered troubled debt restructures with outstanding principal balances in excess of $25,000. The Company identifies troubled debt restructures by reviewing each renewal, modification, or extension of a loan with a screening document. This document is designed to identify any characteristics of such a loan that would qualify it as a troubled debt restructure. If the characteristics are not present that would qualify a loan as a troubled debt restructure, it is deemed to be a modification.\nThe recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $21,365,000 at December 31, 2015 and had a related valuation allowance of $899,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2015 was approximately $20,818,000. As of December 31, 2014, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $25,120,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,603,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2014 was approximately $24,127,000. As of December 31, 2013, the recorded investment in loans and leases that were considered to be impaired totaled $27,034,000 and had a related valuation allowance of $1,598,000. The average recorded investment in impaired loans and leases during 2013 was approximately $27,975,000.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) to cover probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, which is based upon management's estimate of those losses. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan and lease losses and is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries and reduced by charge-offs. Actual losses for loans and leases can vary significantly from this estimate. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process. The model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change.\nThe adequacy of the ALLL and the level of the related provision for loan and lease losses is determined based on management's judgment after consideration of numerous factors including, but not limited to: (i) local and regional economic conditions, (ii) the financial condition of the borrowers, (iii) loan impairment and the related level of expected charge-offs, (iv) evaluation of industry trends, (v) industry and other concentrations, (vi) loans and leases which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management, (vii) continuing evaluations of the performing loan portfolio, (viii) ongoing review and evaluation of problem loans identified as having loss potential, (ix) quarterly review by the Board of Directors, and (x) assessments by banking regulators and other third parties. Management and the Board of Directors evaluate the ALLL and determine its appropriate level considering objective and subjective measures, such as knowledge of the borrowers' business, valuation of collateral, the determination of impaired loans or leases and exposure to potential losses.\n 46 \n \nThe ALLL totaled $4,975,000 or 1.69% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2015, $5,301,000 or 2.01% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2014, and $5,346,000 or 2.08% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses from $5,346,000 at December 31, 2013 to $4,975,000 at December 31, 2015, was mainly due to a decrease in historical losses impacting the loss factor used in calculating the reserve on loans collectively valued for impairment. The Company establishes general and specific reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The ALLL is composed of categories of the loan and lease portfolio based on loan type and loan rating; however, the entire allowance is available to cover actual loan and lease losses. While management uses available information to recognize possible losses on loans and leases, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on changes in economic conditions and other matters. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's ALLL. Such agencies may require the Company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases was 302.8% at December 31, 2015 and 320.7% at December 31, 2014. The allowance for loans and leases as a percentage of impaired loans and leases was 23.3% at December 31, 2015 and 21.1% at December 31, 2014. Of the total non-performing and impaired loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2015, there were $4,757,000 in loans or leases that had been reduced by partial charge-offs of $816,000.\nAt December 31, 2015, there was $12,607,000 in impaired loans or leases that did not carry a specific reserve. Of this amount, $3,900,000 were loans or leases that had previous partial charge-offs and $8,707,000 in loans or leases that were analyzed and determined not to require a specific reserve or charge-off because the collateral value or discounted cash flow value exceeded the loan or lease balance. Prior to 2013, the Company had been operating in a market that had experienced significant decreases in real estate values of commercial, residential, land, and construction properties. As such, the Company continues to focus on monitoring collateral values for those loans considered collateral dependent. The collateral evaluations performed by the Company are updated as necessary, which is generally once every twelve months, and are reviewed by a qualified credit officer.\nThe Company's policy with regard to loan or lease charge-offs continues to be that a loan or lease is charged off against the ALLL when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. As previously discussed in the Impaired Loans and Leases\u201d section, certain loans are evaluated for impairment. Generally, if a loan is collateralized by real estate, and considered collateral dependent, the impaired portion will be charged off to the allowance for loan and lease losses unless it is in the process of collection, in which case a specific reserve may be warranted. If the collateral is other than real estate and considered impaired, a specific reserve may be warranted.\nIt is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Formula allocations are calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Historical loss factors are based upon the Company's loss experience. These historical loss factors are adjusted for changes in the business cycle and for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. The discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is prudent and adequate. However, no prediction of the ultimate level of loans and leases charged off in future periods can be made with any certainty. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company made a specific enhancement to its methodology for determining the general reserve component of the ALLL. The enhancement related specifically to the methodology used to calculate the qualitative factors with respect to non-impaired loans graded watch, special mention and substandard by eliminating the use of multipliers. The ALLL methodology was also revised to add an additional qualitative factor, by loan grade, in calculating the general reserve component of the ALLL. Management believes that the allocation of the ALLL to each loan risk grade, within each loan type has become more precise under the methodology enhancement. The implementation of the ALLL model revision did not have a material impact on the calculation of the required allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015.\n 47 \n \nTable Nine below summarizes, for the periods indicated, the activity in the ALLL.\nTable Nine: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nAs part of its loan review process, management has allocated the overall allowance based on specific identified problem loans and leases, qualitative factors, uncertainty inherent in the estimation process and historical loss data. A risk exists that future losses cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or leases or classes of loans and leases. Management continues to evaluate the loan and lease portfolio and assesses current economic conditions that will affect management's conclusion as to future allowance levels. Table Ten below summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended December 31, 2015.\n 48 \n \nTable Ten: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Loan Category\n\nThe allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan and lease category represents the total amounts available for charge-offs that may occur within these categories.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance in OREO at December 31, 2015 consisted of three properties acquired through foreclosure. The balance in OREO at December 31, 2014 consisted of seven properties. During 2015, the Company received $1,153,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of four OREO properties with net losses of $1,000 in the aggregate recognized on these sales and, prior to sale, there was a write-down of $156,000 to the OREO allowance and $76,000 to expense on two of the four properties. Furthermore, there were capitalized costs of $126,000 on a single existing property. There was $3,551,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2015 with no valuation allowance and $4,803,000 in other real estate owned at December 31, 2014 with a valuation allowance of $156,000.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2015, total deposits were $530,690,000 representing an increase of $19,997,000 (3.9%) from the December 31, 2014 balance of $510,693,000. The Company's deposit growth plan for 2015 was to concentrate its efforts on increasing noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing money market and interest-bearing checking, and savings accounts, while continuing to focus on reducing overall interest expense. Due to these efforts, the Company experienced increases during 2015 in noninterest-bearing demand ($34,850,000 or 22.4%), interest-bearing checking ($462,000 or 0.8%), and savings ($241,000 or 0.4%) and decreases in money market ($12,439,000 or 8.4%) and time deposit ($3,117,000 or 3.6%) accounts. The decrease in money market accounts is related to the plan to reduce interest expense as the Company evaluated the rate structure on some of the higher cost money market accounts and reduced the interest rates on some relationships.\n 49 \n \nOther Borrowed Funds\n\tOther borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB\u201d). The following table summarizes these borrowings (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe maximum amount of short-term borrowings at any month-end during 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $11,500,000, $3.500,000, and $8,000,000, respectively. The FHLB advances are collateralized by loans and securities pledged to the FHLB. The following is a breakdown of rates and maturities on FHLB advances (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe Company has the ability to enter into letters of credit with the FHLB. There were no letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2015 or 2014. There were no draws upon any letter of credit in 2015 or 2014 and management does not expect to draw upon these sources of liquidity in the foreseeable future.\nCapital Resources\nThe current and projected capital position of the Company and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company's capital position represents the level of capital available to support continuing operations and expansion.\nOn January 17, 2014, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2014 (the 2014 Program\u201d). The 2014 Program authorized the repurchase during 2014 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. During 2014, the Company repurchased 424,462 shares of its common stock at an average price of $9.77 per share. On January 21, 2015, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2015 (the 2015 Program\u201d). The 2015 Program authorized the repurchase during 2015 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, on July 15, 2015, the Company approved and authorized an additional amount of 5% to be purchased under the 2015 Program. During 2015, the Company repurchased 790,989 shares of its common stock at an average price of $9.92 per share. On January 20, 2016, the Company approved and authorized a stock repurchase program for 2016 (the 2016 Program\u201d). The 2016 Program authorized the repurchase during 2016 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, or approximately 367,182 shares based on the 7,343,649 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Any repurchases under the 2016 Program will be made from time to time by the Company in the open market as conditions allow. All such transactions will be structured to comply with Commission Rule 10b-18 and all shares repurchased under the 2016 Program will be retired. The number, price and timing of the repurchases will be at the Company's sole discretion and the 2016 Program may be re-evaluated depending on market conditions, capital and liquidity needs or other factors. Based on such re-evaluation, the Board of Directors may suspend, terminate, modify or cancel the 2016 Program at any time without notice.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares in 2011 or 2010 and repurchased 575,389 shares in 2012 and 849,404 shares in 2013. Share amounts have been adjusted for stock dividends and/or splits. See Part II, Item 5, Stock Repurchases\u201d for more information regarding stock repurchases.\nThe Company and American River Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's and American River Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the most recent regulatory notification categorized American River Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action plan. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's categories.\n 50 \n \nAt December 31, 2015, shareholders' equity was $86,075,000, representing a decrease of $3,572,000 (5.1%) from $89,647,000 at December 31, 2014. The decrease resulted from a decrease in other comprehensive income of $1,268,000 as a result of the decrease in the unrealized gain on securities due to an increase in interest rates, additions from net income of $5,269,000 for the period and the stock based compensation of $271,000, offset by repurchases of common stock of $7,843,000. In 2014, shareholders' equity increased $2,627,000 (3.0%) from $87,020,000 at December 31, 2013. The increase resulted from the additions from net income for the period, an increase in other comprehensive income, and an increase in stock based compensation exceeding the repurchases of common stock.\nTable Eleven below lists the Company's actual capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as well as the minimum capital ratios for capital adequacy.\nTable Eleven: Capital Ratios\n\nCapital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet future needs. At December 31, 2015, American River Bank's ratios were in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized.\u201d \tManagement believes that the Company's capital is adequate to support current operations and anticipated growth and currently foreseeable future capital requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revised and replaced the then current risk-based capital requirements in order to implement the Basel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules included an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components and the calculation of risk-weighted assets.\nEffective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 Billion or more and banks like American River Bank were required to comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which would consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets ( leverage\u201d) ratio of 4%.\nIn addition, a capital conservation buffer,\u201d is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.\n 51 \n \nMarket Risk Management\nOverview. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan, investment and deposit functions. The goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the Company is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the Company to undue interest rate risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the interest rate risk management policies. The Company has an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, made up of Company management that establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates.\nAsset/Liability Management. Activities involved in asset/liability management include but are not limited to lending, accepting and placing deposits and investing in securities. Interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset/liability management. Sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates. The asset/liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments. The Company uses simulation models to forecast earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity.\nSimulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes. Using computer-modeling techniques, with specialized software built for this specific purpose for financial institutions, the Company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings, net interest margin and market value of equity. A balance sheet is prepared using detailed inputs of actual loans, securities and interest-bearing liabilities (i.e. deposits/borrowings). The balance sheet is processed using multiple interest rate scenarios. The scenarios include a rising rate forecast, a flat rate forecast and a falling rate forecast which take place within a one-year time frame. The net interest income is measured over a one and a two year periods assuming a gradual change in rates over the twelve-month horizon. The simulation modeling attempts to estimate changes in the Company's net interest income utilizing a detailed current balance sheet.\nAfter a review of the model results as of December 31, 2015, the Company does not consider the fluctuations from the base case, to have a material impact on the Company's projected results and are within the tolerance levels outlined in the Company's interest rate risk polices. The simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions, which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations. Therefore, they do not reflect likely actual results, but serve as reasonable estimates of interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nInterest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing or maturity. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons. The differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps. A positive cumulative gap may be equated to an asset sensitive position. An asset sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to expand. This results as floating or variable rate loans reprice more rapidly than fixed rate certificates of deposit that reprice as they mature over time. Conversely, a declining interest rate environment will cause the opposite effect. A negative cumulative gap may be equated to a liability sensitive position. A liability sensitive position in a rising interest rate environment will cause a bank's interest rate margin to contract, while a declining interest rate environment will have the opposite effect.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing, or other commercial concerns, primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary. In general, inflation primarily affects the Company through its effect on market rates of interest, which affects the Company's ability to attract loan customers. Inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand, and potentially adversely affects capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which may be generated in the future. In addition to its effects on interest rates, inflation increases overall operating expenses. Inflation has not had a material effect upon the results of operations of the Company during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n 52 \n \nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients. Both assets and liabilities contribute to the Company's liquidity position. Federal funds lines, short-term investments and securities, and loan and lease repayments contribute to liquidity, along with deposit increases, while loan and lease funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity. The Company assesses the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns, current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs. Commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2015 were approximately $26,730,000 and $238,000, respectively. Such loan commitments relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans and to real estate construction loans. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe Company's sources of liquidity consist of cash and due from correspondent banks, overnight funds sold to correspondent banks, unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale. On December 31, 2015, consolidated liquid assets totaled $229.7 million or 36.2% of total assets compared to $234.7 million or 38.0% of total assets on December 31, 2014. In addition to liquid assets, the Company maintains short-term lines of credit in the amount of $17,000,000 with two of its correspondent banks. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $17,000,000 available under these credit lines. Additionally, American River Bank is a member of the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, American River Bank could have arranged for up to $89,326,000 in secured borrowings from the FHLB. These borrowings are secured by pledged mortgage loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $78,326,000 available under these secured borrowing arrangements. American River Bank also has a secured borrowing arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank. The borrowing can be secured by pledging selected loans and investment securities. Based on the amount of assets pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank at December 31, 2015, the Company's borrowing capacity was $11,371,000.\nThe Company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and, as such, its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations. Accordingly, management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits.\nLiquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities. The Company can sell any of its unpledged securities held in the available-for-sale category to meet liquidity needs. These securities are also available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise. American River Bank can also pledge additional securities to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB.\nThe maturity distribution of certificates of deposit is set forth in Table Thirteen below for the period presented. These deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and, therefore, are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available.\n\nLoan and lease demand also affects the Company's liquidity position. Table Fourteen below presents the maturities of loans and leases for the period indicated.\n 53 \n \n\nLoans and leases shown above with maturities greater than one year include $169,728,000 of variable interest rate loans and $96,087,000 of fixed interest rate loans and leases.\nThe carrying amount, maturity distribution and weighted average yield of the Company's investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios are presented in Table Fifteen below. The yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax equivalent basis. Yields may not represent actual future income to be recorded. Timing of principal prepayments on mortgage-backed securities may increase or decrease depending on market factors and the borrowers' ability to make unscheduled principal payments. Fast prepayments on bonds that were purchased with a premium will result in a lower yield and slower prepayments on premium bonds will result in a higher yield, the opposite would be true for bonds purchased at a discount. Table Fifteen does not include FHLB Stock, which does not have stated maturity dates or readily available market values. The balance in FHLB Stock at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $3,779,000, $3,686,000 and $3,248,000, respectively.\nTable Fifteen: Securities Maturities and Weighted Average Yields\n\nThe carrying values of available-for-sale securities include net unrealized gains of $3,504,000, $5,618,000 and $1,872,000 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The carrying values of held-to-maturity securities do not include unrealized gains or losses; however, the net unrecognized gains at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $46,000, $60,000 and $78,000, respectively.\n 54 \n \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2015, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options or similar instruments. At origination, real estate commitments are generally secured by property with a loan-to-value ratio of 55% to 75%. In addition, the majority of the Company's commitments have variable interest rates. The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk:\n\nThe Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and letters of credit as it does for loans included on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain financial institutions have elected to use special purpose vehicles ( SPV\u201d) to dispose of problem assets. The SPV is typically a subsidiary company with an asset and liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent corporation goes bankrupt. Under certain circumstances, these financial institutions may exclude the problem assets from their reported impaired and non-performing assets. The Company does not use those vehicles or any other structures to dispose of problem assets.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company leases certain facilities at which it conducts its operations. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are noted in Table Sixteen below. Table Sixteen below presents certain of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Included in the table are amounts payable under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, Deferred Fees Plan and salary continuation agreements listed in the Other Long-Term Liabilities...\u201d category. At December 31, 2015, these amounts represented $4,089,000 most of which is anticipated to be primarily payable at least five years in the future.\n\n 55 \n \nAccounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued FASB Accounting Standards Update (the Update\u201d) 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure. Under this Update, FASB amended existing guidance to clarify when a creditor should be considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan such that the loan should be derecognized and the real estate recognized. These amendments clarify that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either:\n(1)\t the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or\n(2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.\nThe amendments in this Update were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods within that reporting period. The effects of adopting this Update did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This Update requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments within this update are effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this update, but does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Update 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10). Under this Update, FASB enhanced the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This Update contains several provisions, including but not limited to 1) require equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) eliminated the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value; and 4) require separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Update is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this Update will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n 56 \n ", "item_7_tables": "Table 191: <table>

2014. This was driven by higher net interest income, though partially offset by lower noninterest income.\n\n- Loans and leases increased 12% to $289.1 million at the end of 2015 compared to the prior year. This growth was broad-based across commercial, real estate, and consumer loan categories. \n\n- Deposits increased 4% to $530.7 million compared to the prior year. The company focused on growing lower-cost deposit accounts.\n\n- Nonperforming loans continued to decrease, dropping to $1.6 million at the end of 2015. This led to no provision for loan losses in 2015 compared to a negative provision in 2014. \n\n- The company repurchased $7.8 million of its common stock in 2015 as part of its share repurchase program. \n\n- The net interest margin increased to 3.63% in 2015 compared to 3.54% in the prior year due to higher earning asset yields.\n\n- Capital levels remained strong, with Tier 1 capital ratio at 19.3% and total risk-based capital ratio at 20.6% at year-end.\n\nIn summary, the company showed improved profitability, loan growth, and credit quality in 2015 compared to the prior year. It continues to maintain a solid capital position."}
