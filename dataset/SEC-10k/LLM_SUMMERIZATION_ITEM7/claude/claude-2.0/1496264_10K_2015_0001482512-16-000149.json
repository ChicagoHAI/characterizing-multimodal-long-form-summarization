Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, see Part IV, Item 15(a). Statements contained in this Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Some of the information presented is forward-looking in nature, including information concerning projected future occupancy rates, rental rate increases, property development timing and investment amounts. Although the information is based on our current expectations, actual results could vary from expectations stated in this report. Numerous factors will affect our actual results, some of which are beyond our control. These include the breadth and duration of the current economic recession and its impact on our tenants, the strength of commercial and industrial real estate markets, market conditions affecting tenants, competitive market conditions, interest rate levels, volatility in our stock price and capital market conditions. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information, which speaks only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our ongoing requirements under federal securities laws to disclose material information. For a discussion of important risks related to our business, and related to investing in our securities, including risks that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from results and events referred to in the forward-looking information, see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and the discussion under the captions Forward-looking Statements\u201d above and Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d contained in this Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur.\nExecutive Summary\nThrough our interest in Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. (our operating partnership) and its subsidiaries, at December 31, 2015, our consolidated office portfolio consisted of approximately 14.0 million square feet of in-service, redevelopment, development and held for sale properties, and our media and entertainment portfolio consisted of 0.9 million square feet. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated in-service office portfolio was 90.1% leased (including leases not yet commenced). Our media and entertainment properties were 78.5% leased for the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCurrent Year Acquisitions, Dispositions, Held for Sale, Redevelopment and Financings\nAcquisitions\nEOP Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, we completed the EOP Acquisition from Blackstone. The EOP Acquisition consisted of 26 high-quality office assets totaling approximately 8.2 million square feet and two development parcels located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, proration, and closing costs included a cash payment of $1.75 billion (financed largely with proceeds received from our January 2015 common equity offering and $1.30 billion of new term debt), and an aggregate of 63,474,791 shares of common stock and common units.\n4th & Traction\nOn May 22, 2015, we acquired a three-story, 120,937-square-foot former manufacturing facility known as 4th & Traction in Los Angeles, California for $49.3 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). We funded this off-market transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n405 Mateo\nOn August 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 405 Mateo, a three-building, 83,285-square-foot redevelopment project in Downtown Los Angeles' Arts District for $40.0 million (before credits, prorations, and closing costs). We funded this transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nDispositions\nFirst Financial\nOn March 6, 2015, we sold our First Financial office property for $89.0 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $46.0 million after repayment of a $43.0 million loan secured by the property (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The proceeds were used pursuant to a like-kind Section 1031 exchange in connection with the EOP Acquisition.\nBay Park Plaza\nOn September 29, 2015, we sold our Bay Park Plaza office property for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our two-year term loan facility.\nHeld for Sale\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our Bayhill office property for $215.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). As a result, we have reclassified its assets and liabilities to held for sale as of December 31, 2015. The transaction closed on January 14, 2016.\nRedevelopment\nWe select a property for redevelopment when we believe the result of doing so will render a higher economic return on the property. We may engage in the development or redevelopment of office properties when market conditions support a favorable risk-adjusted return. A redevelopment can consist of a range of improvements to a property, and may constitute a complete structural renovation of a building or remodeling select areas to make the property more attractive to tenants. Properties that undergo such renovations are excluded from our in-service portfolio to maintain consistency in evaluating our performance from period to period. The redevelopment process generally occurs over the course of several months or years, and requires significant development and construction costs. Commonly associated with newly-acquired properties, redevelopment efforts may also occur at properties we currently own. During 2015, there were a total of seven properties classified as under redevelopment: Merrill Place Theater Building, Patrick Henry Drive, 875 Howard (1st Floor), 12655 Jefferson, 3402 Pico (Existing), 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo. Of this group, 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo were acquired in 2015 for the purpose of redevelopment.\nFinancings\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facilities\nA&R Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2015 (the A&R Credit Facilities\u201d), which amended and restated our existing $300.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $150.0 million unsecured term loan facility to, among other things, extend the term, increase the unsecured revolving credit facility to $400.0 million and the unsecured 5-year term loan facility to $550.0 million, and add a $350.0 million unsecured 7-year term loan facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan were fully drawn and used towards the EOP Acquisition. The unsecured revolving credit facility is available for other purposes, including for the payment of pre-development and development costs incurred in connection with properties owned by our operating partnership or any subsidiary, to finance capital expenditures and the repayment for indebtedness of the Company, and its subsidiaries, to provide for general working capital needs of the Company, our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the A&R Credit Facilities.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 1, 2015, we entered into a New Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a $550.0 million unsecured 2-year term loan credit facility (the Two-Year Term Loan\u201d), which was fully drawn by us on the date of the New Credit Agreement to consummate the EOP Acquisition, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with that acquisition and the Two-Year Term Loan.\nThe entire balance of the Two-Year Term Loan was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2015 with the proceeds from the Bay Park Plaza disposition, excess cash from the Element LA refinancing, and proceeds from the $425.0 million private placement described below. Amounts paid down are no longer available for re-borrowing.\nElement LA Refinancing\nOn October 9, 2015, we entered into and closed a ten-year mortgage loan in the amount of $168.0 million, secured by the Element L.A. campus. The purpose of the loan was to fully refinance an existing construction loan secured by Element L.A. that was scheduled to mature on November 1, 2017. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Two-Year Term Loan. The loan is interest only and is payable monthly at a fixed rate of 4.59% per annum. No prepayment is allowed until three months prior to the maturity date. Defeasance is permitted (at Borrower's cost) after the earlier of: (x) two years after securitization or (y) three years after the closing of the Loan. The loan is non-recourse, subject to customary carve-outs. In addition, the loan agreement includes events of default that we believe are usual for loans and transactions of this type.\nNote Purchase Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which provides for the private placement of $425.0 million of senior guaranteed notes by our operating partnership, of which (i) $110.0 million are designated as 4.34% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2, 2023 (the Series A Notes\u201d), (ii) $259.0 million are designated as 4.69% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2025 (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (iii) $56.0 million are designated as 4.79% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2027 (the Series C Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on December 16, 2015. Proceeds from the Notes were used toward the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Two-Year Term Loan with the remainder used toward the repayment of our revolving credit facility.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the New Term Loan Agreement\u201d) which provides for (i) an unsecured 5-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $175.0 million (the 5-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) an unsecured 7-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $125.0 million ( the 7-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Company intends to use the amounts available under the 5-Year Term Loan Facility and the 7-Year Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, repay other outstanding secured or unsecured indebtedness, or for general corporate purposes.\nRedemption of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn December 10, 2015, we redeemed all 5,800,000 shares of our issued and outstanding 8.375% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for a total redemption price of approximately $147.3 million. We funded the redemption using borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFactors That May Influence Our Operating Results\nBusiness and Strategy\nWe focus our investment strategy on office properties located in submarkets with growth potential as well as on underperforming properties or portfolios that provide opportunities to implement a value-add strategy to increase occupancy rates and cash flow. Additionally, we intend to acquire properties or portfolios that are distressed due to near-term debt maturities or underperforming properties where we believe better management, focused leasing efforts and/or capital improvements would improve the property's operating performance and value. Our strategy also includes active management, aggressive leasing efforts, focused capital improvement programs, the reduction and containment of operating costs and an emphasis on tenant satisfaction, which we believe will minimize turnover costs and improve occupancy.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties as a key part of our growth strategy, often including properties that may have substantial vacancy, which enables us to increase cash flow through lease-up. We expect to continue to acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to incur indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock, common units and series A preferred units.\nRental Revenue\nThe amount of net rental revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from lease terminations. As of December 31, 2015, the percent leased for our in-service office properties was approximately 90.1% (or 88.8%, excluding leases signed but not commenced as of that date), and the percent leased for the media and entertainment properties (based on 12-month trailing average) was approximately 78.5%. The amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe that the average rental rates for our office properties are generally below the current average quoted market rate. We believe the average rental rates for our media and entertainment properties are generally equal to current average quoted market rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in our tenants' industries that impair our ability to renew or re-let space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. In addition, growth in rental revenue will also partially depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are all located in California and Pacific Northwest submarkets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in California or Pacific Northwest, including state budgetary shortfalls, employment rates, natural hazards and other factors, may impact our overall performance.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs. Increases in these expenses over tenants' base years are generally passed on to tenants in our full-service gross leased properties and are generally paid in full by tenants in our net lease properties. Certain of our properties have been reassessed for property tax purposes as a result of our initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition and other reassessments remain pending. In the case of completed reassessments, the amount of property taxes we pay reflects the valuations established with the county assessors for the relevant locations of each property as of the initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition. With respect to pending reassessments, we similarly expect the amount of property taxes we pay to reflect the valuations established with such county assessors.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs part of the formation transactions, we formed Hudson Pacific Services, Inc., or our services company, a Maryland corporation that is wholly owned by our operating partnership. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes, and we may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. Our services company generally may provide both customary and non-customary services to our tenants and engage in other activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT. Our services company and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide a number of services to certain tenants at our media and entertainment properties and, from time to time, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries may provide services to our tenants at these and other properties. In addition, our operating partnership has contributed some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. We currently lease space to wholly owned subsidiaries of our services company at our media and entertainment properties and may, from time to time, enter into additional leases with one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable), as a regular C corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nAcquisitions\nWhen we acquire properties that are considered business combinations, the purchase price is assigned to various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components include but are not limited to land, building and improvements, intangible assets related to above-and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. The initial assignment of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price assignment are made within the assignment period, which typically does not exceed one year, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe assess fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\nThe fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. The fair value of acquired above-and below-\u201d market leases are based on the estimated cash flow projections utilizing discount rates that reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rents at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Acquisition-related expenses associated with business combinations are expensed in the period incurred.\nCost Capitalization\nWe capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate project. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits, office rent, and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities are also capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Construction and development costs are capitalized while substantial activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year after cessation of major construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are expensed as they are incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as they are incurred.\nOperating Properties\nThe properties are generally carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of generally 39 years for building and improvements, 15 years for land improvements, five or seven years for furniture and fixtures and equipment, and over the shorter of asset life or life of the lease for tenant improvements. Above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to revenue over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if applicable. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Impairment losses are recorded on real estate assets held for investment\nwhen indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. We recognize impairment losses to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the properties. We recorded no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due for monthly rents and other charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts and our historical collection experience. We recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. Historical experience has been within management's expectations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize rental revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.\nOther property-related revenue is revenue that is derived from the tenants' use of lighting, equipment rental, parking, power, HVAC and telecommunications (telephone and internet). Other property-related revenue is recognized when these items are provided.\nTenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the associated credit risk.\nWe recognize gains on sales of properties upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) We are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and (iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the total compensation expense for time-vested shares on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant of our restricted shares.\nThe cost of our Outperformance Program ( OPP\u201d) is subject to a forfeiture adjustment and is amortized through the final vesting period under a graded vesting expense recognition schedule. The costs were valued in accordance with ASC 718, utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the performance vesting conditions being satisfied. The Monte Carlo simulation used a statistical formula underlying the Black-Scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation was run 100,000 times. For each simulation, the payoff is calculated at the settlement date, which is then discounted to the award date at a risk-free interest rate. The average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date. Assumptions used in the valuations included (1) factors associated with the underlying performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return over the term of the performance awards, including total stock return volatility and risk-free interest. and (2) factors associated with the relative performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return when compared to the SNL Equity REIT Index. The valuation was performed in a risk-neutral framework, so no assumption was made with respect to an equity risk premium. The fair value of the OPP awards is based on the sum of: (1) the present value of the expected payoff to the awards on the measurement date, if the TSR over the applicable measurement period exceeds performance hurdles of the absolute and the relative TSR components; and (2) the present value of the distributions payable on the awards. The ultimate reward realized on account of the OPP awards by the holders of the awards is contingent on the TSR achieved on the measurement date, both in absolute terms and relative to the TSR of the SNL Equity REIT Index.\nOur compensation committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs.\nIncome Taxes\nOur property-owning subsidiaries are limited liability companies and are treated as pass-through entities or disregarded entities (or, in the case of the entity that owns the 1455 Market Street property, a REIT) for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the activities of these entities.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such manner. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.\nProvided that we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nWe have elected, together with one of our subsidiaries, to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. Certain activities that we may undertake, such as non-customary services for our tenants and holding assets that we cannot hold directly, will be conducted by a TRS. A TRS is subject to federal and, where applicable, state income taxes on its net income.\nWe are subject to the statutory requirements of the states in which we conduct business.\nWe periodically evaluate our tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. As of December 31, 2015, we have not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nWe and our TRS file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state and local jurisdictions. We and our TRS are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2011. Generally, we have assessed\nour tax positions for all open years, which include 2011 to 2015, and concluded that there are no material uncertainties to be recognized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table identifies each of the properties in our portfolio acquired through December 31, 2015 and their date of acquisition.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual or Estimated Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consideration Paid\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predecessor properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>875 Howard Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/15/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Gower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/17/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Bronson\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1/30/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technicolor Building\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired after initial public offering:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Del Amo Office\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/13/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9300 Wilshire Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/24/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>222 Kearny Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/8/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1455 Market(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rincon Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10950 Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/22/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>604 Arizona\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/26/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>275 Brannan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/19/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>625 Second Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/1/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6922 Hollywood Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/22/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6050 Sunset Blvd. & 1445 N.

this discussion of our results of operations are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this report rather than the rounded numbers appearing in this discussion.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet Operating Income\nWe evaluate performance based upon property net operating income ( NOI\u201d) from continuing operations. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. All companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items. NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses.\nManagement further evaluates NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Same-Store

The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Square) and Rincon Center (Sales Force) properties at higher rents than expiring leases, partially offset by a one-time GAAP straight line rent write-off at our Howard Street property (Heald College).\nOffice tenant recoveries decreased by $5.2 million or 15.9% to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to $3.6 million of\none-time property tax recoveries resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and\nto a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014.\nOffice parking and other revenue decreased by $4.2 million or 21.3% to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a one time termination fee at our 625 Second Street (Fox interactive) and 222 Kearny (The Children's Place) properties recognized in 2014.\nOffice operating expenses decreased by $2.3 million or 3.3% to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to one time property tax expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by increases in operating expenses across all same store properties.\nSame-Store Media & Entertainment:\nMedia and entertainment rental revenue, tenant recoveries and other property-related revenue decreased by $0.5 million or 1.3% to $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is the result of our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by additional lighting expense in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $10.3 million, or 36.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2015 OPP Plan and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth related to the EOP Acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $172.9 million, or 239.4%, to $245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to depreciation expenses associated with the EOP Acquisition on April 1, 2015. The remaining increase is a result of the assets associated with the early termination of a tenant at our Howard Street property, lease-up of our Element LA, 1455 Market, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the reduction of depreciation expense as a result of the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015 and sale of our Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $24.7 million, or 95.4%, to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had $2,278.4 million, before deferred loan costs recorded as a net against the loan balance, of notes payable, compared to $957.5 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.3 billion of term loan borrowings used to finance the EOP Acquisition, partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood, 275 Brannan and First and King properties and repayment of debt associated with the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $38.7 million, or 833.8%, to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily as a result of acquisition costs related to the EOP Acquisition.\nGain on sale of real estate increase by $24.9 million, or 450.2% to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.5 million or the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gain on sale is a result of the sales of First Financial on March 5, 2015 for $89.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) and Bay Park Plaza on September 29, 2015 for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) generating $30.5 million of gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $5.5 million

The increase is primarily due to heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMedia and entertainment other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 160.4% to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to increase in operating income from our United Recording studio operations.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7.2%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect a property tax reimbursement resulting from the reassessment of the Sunset Gower media and entertainment property of $0.8 million, with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining difference relates additional lighting expense incurred in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million, or 41.6%, to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2014 Outperformance Program, the costs associated with a one-year consulting arrangement with a former executive, and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth through the acquisition of office properties.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 3.1%, to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of the Pinnacle II building by our joint venture with MDP/Worthe on June 14, 2013, our acquisition of the Seattle portfolio on July 31, 2013, and our acquisition of the Merrill Place property on February 12, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 1.8%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had $960.5 million of notes payable, compared to $931.3 million at December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense for a full year on the indebtedness associated with our 275 Brannan property, the indebtedness associated with the Pinnacle II building acquired on June 14, 2013, the indebtedness associated with the acquisition of the Seattle Portfolio, the indebtedness associated with the redevelopments of our Element LA property, and amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, all partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 625 Second Street property on November 1, 2013, and our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood property on October 1, 2014 and additional capitalized interest related to our redevelopment properties as compared to the same period last year.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $3.2 million, or 221.0%, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of acquisition costs related to the upcoming purchase of the EOP Northern California portfolio compared to by the acquisition costs related to the purchase of the Seattle portfolio in 2013.\nGain on sale of real estate. On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Tierrasanta property for $19.5 million (before certain credits, prorations, and closing costs). Accordingly, the Company recognized $5.5 million of gain on sale of real estate relates the current year with no comparable activity in the same period a year ago.\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company sold its City Plaza property in Orange, California, for approximately $56.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). Accordingly, the City Plaza property was reclassified as held for sale and its financial results are accounted for as discontinued operations for each of the periods presented. The Company also recognized $5.6 million of impairment loss in the year ended December 31, 2013, with no comparable activity in the current year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had approximately $53.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 20, 2015, we closed the public offering of 12,650,000 shares of our common stock. We used $130.0 million of proceeds from that stock offering to fully pay down the $130.0 million outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total borrowing capacity of $400.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $230.0 million of which had been drawn.\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a New Term Loan Agreement that will allow us to draw $175.0 million related to a 5-year term loan and $125.0 million under a 7-year term loan. As of December 31, 2015 none of these amounts have been drawn.\nWe have an ATM program which allows us to sell up to $125.0 million of common stock, $14.5 million of which has been sold as of December 31, 2015.\nWe intend to use the unsecured revolving credit facility, New Term Loan Agreement and ATM program, among other things, to finance the acquisition of other properties, to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes.\nBased on the closing price of our common stock of $28.14 as of December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately 35.7% (counting series A preferred units as debt) as of December 31, 2015. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio), including restricted stock that we may issue to certain of our directors and executive officers, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series A preferred units, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT status, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash\non hand, net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, by drawing upon our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our unsecured revolving credit facility pending permanent financing.\nWe believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness creates the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding notes payable of $2.28 billion (before $1.3 million loan premium and $19.0 million of deferred finance costs), of which $1.34 billion, or 58.8%, was variable rate debt. $806.5 million of the variable rate debt is subject to the interest rate contracts described in Part IV, Item 15(a) Financial Statement and Schedules-Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Interest Rate Contracts\u201d.\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 with respect to the Company's outstanding indebtedness.

The increase was primarily\nattributable to an increase in cash NOI, as defined, from our office properties, primarily from the EOP Acquisition, increased occupancy and higher rental revenue from our 1455 Market, Rincon Center, Element LA, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014. The increase was also attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in leasing costs primarily related to our Element LA property, increase in general and administrative expenses, increase in interest expense due to $1.3 billion of borrowing associated with the acquisition of the EOP Northern California portfolio and an increase in acquisition-related costs associated with the EOP Acquisition as compared to the year-end December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,551.3 million or 629.7% to $1,797.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $246.4 million for year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the EOP Acquisition, the acquisition of 4th & Traction and the acquisition of 405 Mateo during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investing activities was partially offset by the cash provided by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and the sale of our Bay Park Plaza asset on September 29, 2015 offset by the sale of Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,488.1 million or 872.3% to $1,658.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the $1.3 billion of borrowings associated with the EOP Acquisition, an increase in total proceeds generated by the issuance of common equity securities, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $385.6 million (before transaction costs) in 2015, compared to the issuance of equity securities generating total proceeds, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $197.5 million (before transaction costs) in 2014 and an increase in total net proceeds from our joint venture at our 1455 Market property of $217.8 million. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of our Series B preferred stock on December 10, 2015 for approximately $147.3 million, an increase in repayment of debt, an increase in dividends paid to common stock and unitholders and an increase in loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets.\nWe believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs.\nImplicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide.\nHowever, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.\nThe following table presents our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and a reconciliation of FFO to net income (loss):\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td>244,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from Sale of Real Estate\n</td> <td>(30,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>(14,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to preferred stock and units\n</td> <td>(12,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO to common stockholders and unit holders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

(our operating partnership) and its subsidiaries, at December 31, 2015, our consolidated office portfolio consisted of approximately 14.0 million square feet of in-service, redevelopment, development and held for sale properties, and our media and entertainment portfolio consisted of 0.9 million square feet. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated in-service office portfolio was 90.1% leased (including leases not yet commenced). Our media and entertainment properties were 78.5% leased for the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCurrent Year Acquisitions, Dispositions, Held for Sale, Redevelopment and Financings\nAcquisitions\nEOP Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, we completed the EOP Acquisition from Blackstone. The EOP Acquisition consisted of 26 high-quality office assets totaling approximately 8.2 million square feet and two development parcels located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, proration, and closing costs included a cash payment of $1.75 billion (financed largely with proceeds received from our January 2015 common equity offering and $1.30 billion of new term debt), and an aggregate of 63,474,791 shares of common stock and common units.\n4th & Traction\nOn May 22, 2015, we acquired a three-story, 120,937-square-foot former manufacturing facility known as 4th & Traction in Los Angeles, California for $49.3 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). We funded this off-market transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n405 Mateo\nOn August 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 405 Mateo, a three-building, 83,285-square-foot redevelopment project in Downtown Los Angeles' Arts District for $40.0 million (before credits, prorations, and closing costs). We funded this transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nDispositions\nFirst Financial\nOn March 6, 2015, we sold our First Financial office property for $89.0 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $46.0 million after repayment of a $43.0 million loan secured by the property (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The proceeds were used pursuant to a like-kind Section 1031 exchange in connection with the EOP Acquisition.\nBay Park Plaza\nOn September 29, 2015, we sold our Bay Park Plaza office property for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our two-year term loan facility.\nHeld for Sale\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our Bayhill office property for $215.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). As a result, we have reclassified its assets and liabilities to held for sale as of December 31, 2015. The transaction closed on January 14, 2016.\nRedevelopment\nWe select a property for redevelopment when we believe the result of doing so will render a higher economic return on the property. We may engage in the development or redevelopment of office properties when market conditions support a favorable risk-adjusted return. A redevelopment can consist of a range of improvements to a property, and may constitute a complete structural renovation of a building or remodeling select areas to make the property more attractive to tenants. Properties that undergo such renovations are excluded from our in-service portfolio to maintain consistency in evaluating our performance from period to period. The redevelopment process generally occurs over the course of several months or years, and requires significant development and construction costs. Commonly associated with newly-acquired properties, redevelopment efforts may also occur at properties we currently own. During 2015, there were a total of seven properties classified as under redevelopment: Merrill Place Theater Building, Patrick Henry Drive, 875 Howard (1st Floor), 12655 Jefferson, 3402 Pico (Existing), 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo. Of this group, 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo were acquired in 2015 for the purpose of redevelopment.\nFinancings\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facilities\nA&R Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2015 (the A&R Credit Facilities\u201d), which amended and restated our existing $300.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $150.0 million unsecured term loan facility to, among other things, extend the term, increase the unsecured revolving credit facility to $400.0 million and the unsecured 5-year term loan facility to $550.0 million, and add a $350.0 million unsecured 7-year term loan facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan were fully drawn and used towards the EOP Acquisition. The unsecured revolving credit facility is available for other purposes, including for the payment of pre-development and development costs incurred in connection with properties owned by our operating partnership or any subsidiary, to finance capital expenditures and the repayment for indebtedness of the Company, and its subsidiaries, to provide for general working capital needs of the Company, our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the A&R Credit Facilities.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 1, 2015, we entered into a New Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a $550.0 million unsecured 2-year term loan credit facility (the Two-Year Term Loan\u201d), which was fully drawn by us on the date of the New Credit Agreement to consummate the EOP Acquisition, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with that acquisition and the Two-Year Term Loan.\nThe entire balance of the Two-Year Term Loan was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2015 with the proceeds from the Bay Park Plaza disposition, excess cash from the Element LA refinancing, and proceeds from the $425.0 million private placement described below. Amounts paid down are no longer available for re-borrowing.\nElement LA Refinancing\nOn October 9, 2015, we entered into and closed a ten-year mortgage loan in the amount of $168.0 million, secured by the Element L.A. campus. The purpose of the loan was to fully refinance an existing construction loan secured by Element L.A. that was scheduled to mature on November 1, 2017. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Two-Year Term Loan. The loan is interest only and is payable monthly at a fixed rate of 4.59% per annum. No prepayment is allowed until three months prior to the maturity date. Defeasance is permitted (at Borrower's cost) after the earlier of: (x) two years after securitization or (y) three years after the closing of the Loan. The loan is non-recourse, subject to customary carve-outs. In addition, the loan agreement includes events of default that we believe are usual for loans and transactions of this type.\nNote Purchase Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which provides for the private placement of $425.0 million of senior guaranteed notes by our operating partnership, of which (i) $110.0 million are designated as 4.34% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2, 2023 (the Series A Notes\u201d), (ii) $259.0 million are designated as 4.69% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2025 (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (iii) $56.0 million are designated as 4.79% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2027 (the Series C Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on December 16, 2015. Proceeds from the Notes were used toward the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Two-Year Term Loan with the remainder used toward the repayment of our revolving credit facility.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the New Term Loan Agreement\u201d) which provides for (i) an unsecured 5-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $175.0 million (the 5-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) an unsecured 7-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $125.0 million ( the 7-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Company intends to use the amounts available under the 5-Year Term Loan Facility and the 7-Year Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, repay other outstanding secured or unsecured indebtedness, or for general corporate purposes.\nRedemption of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn December 10, 2015, we redeemed all 5,800,000 shares of our issued and outstanding 8.375% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for a total redemption price of approximately $147.3 million. We funded the redemption using borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFactors That May Influence Our Operating Results\nBusiness and Strategy\nWe focus our investment strategy on office properties located in submarkets with growth potential as well as on underperforming properties or portfolios that provide opportunities to implement a value-add strategy to increase occupancy rates and cash flow. Additionally, we intend to acquire properties or portfolios that are distressed due to near-term debt maturities or underperforming properties where we believe better management, focused leasing efforts and/or capital improvements would improve the property's operating performance and value. Our strategy also includes active management, aggressive leasing efforts, focused capital improvement programs, the reduction and containment of operating costs and an emphasis on tenant satisfaction, which we believe will minimize turnover costs and improve occupancy.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties as a key part of our growth strategy, often including properties that may have substantial vacancy, which enables us to increase cash flow through lease-up. We expect to continue to acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to incur indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock, common units and series A preferred units.\nRental Revenue\nThe amount of net rental revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from lease terminations. As of December 31, 2015, the percent leased for our in-service office properties was approximately 90.1% (or 88.8%, excluding leases signed but not commenced as of that date), and the percent leased for the media and entertainment properties (based on 12-month trailing average) was approximately 78.5%. The amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe that the average rental rates for our office properties are generally below the current average quoted market rate. We believe the average rental rates for our media and entertainment properties are generally equal to current average quoted market rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in our tenants' industries that impair our ability to renew or re-let space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. In addition, growth in rental revenue will also partially depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are all located in California and Pacific Northwest submarkets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in California or Pacific Northwest, including state budgetary shortfalls, employment rates, natural hazards and other factors, may impact our overall performance.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs. Increases in these expenses over tenants' base years are generally passed on to tenants in our full-service gross leased properties and are generally paid in full by tenants in our net lease properties. Certain of our properties have been reassessed for property tax purposes as a result of our initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition and other reassessments remain pending. In the case of completed reassessments, the amount of property taxes we pay reflects the valuations established with the county assessors for the relevant locations of each property as of the initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition. With respect to pending reassessments, we similarly expect the amount of property taxes we pay to reflect the valuations established with such county assessors.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs part of the formation transactions, we formed Hudson Pacific Services, Inc., or our services company, a Maryland corporation that is wholly owned by our operating partnership. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes, and we may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. Our services company generally may provide both customary and non-customary services to our tenants and engage in other activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT. Our services company and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide a number of services to certain tenants at our media and entertainment properties and, from time to time, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries may provide services to our tenants at these and other properties. In addition, our operating partnership has contributed some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. We currently lease space to wholly owned subsidiaries of our services company at our media and entertainment properties and may, from time to time, enter into additional leases with one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable), as a regular C corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nAcquisitions\nWhen we acquire properties that are considered business combinations, the purchase price is assigned to various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components include but are not limited to land, building and improvements, intangible assets related to above-and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. The initial assignment of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price assignment are made within the assignment period, which typically does not exceed one year, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe assess fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\nThe fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. The fair value of acquired above-and below-\u201d market leases are based on the estimated cash flow projections utilizing discount rates that reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rents at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Acquisition-related expenses associated with business combinations are expensed in the period incurred.\nCost Capitalization\nWe capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate project. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits, office rent, and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities are also capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Construction and development costs are capitalized while substantial activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year after cessation of major construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are expensed as they are incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as they are incurred.\nOperating Properties\nThe properties are generally carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of generally 39 years for building and improvements, 15 years for land improvements, five or seven years for furniture and fixtures and equipment, and over the shorter of asset life or life of the lease for tenant improvements. Above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to revenue over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if applicable. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Impairment losses are recorded on real estate assets held for investment\nwhen indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. We recognize impairment losses to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the properties. We recorded no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due for monthly rents and other charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts and our historical collection experience. We recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. Historical experience has been within management's expectations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize rental revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. \nCertain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.\nOther property-related revenue is revenue that is derived from the tenants' use of lighting, equipment rental, parking, power, HVAC and telecommunications (telephone and internet). Other property-related revenue is recognized when these items are provided.\nTenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the associated credit risk.\nWe recognize gains on sales of properties upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) We are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and (iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the total compensation expense for time-vested shares on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant of our restricted shares.\nThe cost of our Outperformance Program ( OPP\u201d) is subject to a forfeiture adjustment and is amortized through the final vesting period under a graded vesting expense recognition schedule. The costs were valued in accordance with ASC 718, utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the performance vesting conditions being satisfied. The Monte Carlo simulation used a statistical formula underlying the Black-Scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation was run 100,000 times. For each simulation, the payoff is calculated at the settlement date, which is then discounted to the award date at a risk-free interest rate. The average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date. Assumptions used in the valuations included (1) factors associated with the underlying performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return over the term of the performance awards, including total stock return volatility and risk-free interest. and (2) factors associated with the relative performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return when compared to the SNL Equity REIT Index. The valuation was performed in a risk-neutral framework, so no assumption was made with respect to an equity risk premium. The fair value of the OPP awards is based on the sum of: (1) the present value of the expected payoff to the awards on the measurement date, if the TSR over the applicable measurement period exceeds performance hurdles of the absolute and the relative TSR components; and (2) the present value of the distributions payable on the awards. The ultimate reward realized on account of the OPP awards by the holders of the awards is contingent on the TSR achieved on the measurement date, both in absolute terms and relative to the TSR of the SNL Equity REIT Index.\nOur compensation committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs.\nIncome Taxes\nOur property-owning subsidiaries are limited liability companies and are treated as pass-through entities or disregarded entities (or, in the case of the entity that owns the 1455 Market Street property, a REIT) for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the activities of these entities.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such manner. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.\nProvided that we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nWe have elected, together with one of our subsidiaries, to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. Certain activities that we may undertake, such as non-customary services for our tenants and holding assets that we cannot hold directly, will be conducted by a TRS. A TRS is subject to federal and, where applicable, state income taxes on its net income.\nWe are subject to the statutory requirements of the states in which we conduct business.\nWe periodically evaluate our tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. As of December 31, 2015, we have not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nWe and our TRS file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state and local jurisdictions. We and our TRS are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2011. Generally, we have assessed\nour tax positions for all open years, which include 2011 to 2015, and concluded that there are no material uncertainties to be recognized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table identifies each of the properties in our portfolio acquired through December 31, 2015 and their date of acquisition.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual or Estimated Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consideration Paid\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predecessor properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>875 Howard Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/15/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Gower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/17/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Bronson\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1/30/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technicolor Building\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired after initial public offering:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Del Amo Office\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/13/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9300 Wilshire Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/24/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>222 Kearny Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/8/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1455 Market(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rincon Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10950 Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/22/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>604 Arizona\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/26/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>275 Brannan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/19/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>625 Second Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/1/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6922 Hollywood Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/22/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6050 Sunset Blvd. & 1445 N.

discussion.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet Operating Income\nWe evaluate performance based upon property net operating income ( NOI\u201d) from continuing operations. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. All companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items. NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses.\nManagement further evaluates NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups:\n \u2022 Same-Store Properties-which includes all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1, 2014 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of December 31, 2015, \n \u2022 Non-same store properties, development projects, redevelopment properties, and lease-up properties as of December 31, 2015; and other properties not owned or in operation from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. \nThe following tables

on April 1, 2015. The remaining increase is as a result of lease-up of our Element LA (Riot Games), 901 Market (Nordstrom Rack, Saks and Company, Nerdwallet), 3401 Exposition (Deluxe Entertainment Services) properties and income from our purchase of the Broadway properties-secured note receivable, which we purchased on August 19, 2014. This increase was partially offset by the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015 and the sale of our Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014. \n \u2022 A $0.8 million or 0.7% decrease in net operating income from our same-store office properties resulting primarily from a decrease in lease termination fees in the current year as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we received one-time lease termination fees from Fox Interactive ($3.1 million) and The Children's Place ($1.2 million). The decrease was partially offset by the lease-up of our 1455 Market (Uber and Square) and Rincon Center (Sales Force) properties. \n \u2022 A $1.7 million or 12.2% increase in NOI from our same-store media and entertainment properties resulting primarily from the higher rental revenue generated by strong occupancy and heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property, partially offset by our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate our ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property. \nThe year-over-year changes in the items that comprise same-store net operating income are primarily attributable to the factors discussed below.\nSame-Store Office:\nOffice rental revenue increased $6.2 million or 4.5% to $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $136.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Square) and Rincon Center (Sales Force) properties at higher rents than expiring leases, partially offset by a one-time GAAP straight line rent write-off at our Howard Street property (Heald College).\nOffice tenant recoveries decreased by $5.2 million or 15.9% to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to $3.6 million of\none-time property tax recoveries resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and\nto a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014.\nOffice parking and other revenue decreased by $4.2 million or 21.3% to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a one time termination fee at our 625 Second Street (Fox interactive) and 222 Kearny (The Children's Place) properties recognized in 2014.\nOffice operating expenses decreased by $2.3 million or 3.3% to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to one time property tax expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by increases in operating expenses across all same store properties.\nSame-Store Media & Entertainment:\nMedia and entertainment rental revenue, tenant recoveries and other property-related revenue decreased by $0.5 million or 1.3% to $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is the result of our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by additional lighting expense in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $10.3 million, or 36.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2015 OPP Plan and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth related to the EOP Acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $172.9 million, or 239.4%, to $245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to depreciation expenses associated with the EOP Acquisition on April 1, 2015. The remaining increase is a result of the assets associated with the early termination of a tenant at our Howard Street property, lease-up of our Element LA, 1455 Market, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the reduction of depreciation expense as a result of the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015 and sale of our Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $24.7 million, or 95.4%, to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had $2,278.4 million, before deferred loan costs recorded as a net against the loan balance, of notes payable, compared to $957.5 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.3 billion of term loan borrowings used to finance the EOP Acquisition, partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood, 275 Brannan and First and King properties and repayment of debt associated with the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $38.7 million, or 833.8%, to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily as a result of acquisition costs related to the EOP Acquisition.\nGain on sale of real estate increase by $24.9 million, or 450.2% to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.5 million or the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gain on sale is a result of the sales of First Financial on March 5, 2015 for $89.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) and Bay Park Plaza on September 29, 2015 for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) generating $30.5 million of gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $5.5 million gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the sale of our Tierrasanta property for $19.5 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) on July 16, 2014.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily resulting from:\n \u2022 A $27.0 million or 112.2% increase in net operating income from our non-same store properties primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Pinnacle II property and the Seattle portfolio in 2013 and the Merrill Place property in 2014. \n \u2022 A $6.4 million or 8.2% increase in net operating income from our same-store properties primarily as a result of the lease-up in our 1455 Market and Rincon properties. \n \u2022 A $2.2 million or 14.0% decrease in net operating income from our same-store media and entertainment properties as a result of the Company's decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher rental revenue and tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy and heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property. \nThe year-over-year changes in the items that comprise same store net operating income are primarily attributable to the factors discussed below.\nSame-Store Office:\nOffice rental revenue increased $7.9 million or 8.4% to $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market and Rincon Center properties at higher rents than expiring leases partially offset by lower rental income from our 625 second street property as a result of an early termination from Fox Interactive Media, Inc. at our 625 Second Street property.\nOffice tenant recoveries increased by $2.4 million or 10.8% to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a $3.3 million of one-time property tax recovery resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to this year, partially offset by lower\nrecoveries at our 1455 Market property due to a change from a triple-net recovery structure from Bank of America to a modified gross recovery structure for Uber and Square tenants.\nOffice parking and other revenue increased by $3.2 million or 27.1% to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a one-time termination fee at our 625 Second Street (Fox interactive) and 222 Kearny (The Children's Place) properties recognized in 2014, offset by a decrease in termination fees at our 1455 Market property recognized in 2013.\nOffice operating expenses increased by $7.1 million or 14.1% to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a one-time property tax expense resulting from the resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to this year.\nSame-Store Media & Entertainment:\nMedia and entertainment rental revenue decreased by $0.9 million or 3.8% to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the Company's decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher rental revenue generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment tenant recoveries decreased by $0.7 million or 37.6% to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the Company's decision to take certain buildings and sages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment other property-related revenue increased by $0.7 million or 4.5% to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMedia and entertainment other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 160.4% to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to increase in operating income from our United Recording studio operations.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7.2%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect a property tax reimbursement resulting from the reassessment of the Sunset Gower media and entertainment property of $0.8 million, with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining difference relates additional lighting expense incurred in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million, or 41.6%, to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2014 Outperformance Program, the costs associated with a one-year consulting arrangement with a former executive, and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth through the acquisition of office properties.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 3.1%, to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of the Pinnacle II building by our joint venture with MDP/Worthe on June 14, 2013, our acquisition of the Seattle portfolio on July 31, 2013, and our acquisition of the Merrill Place property on February 12, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 1.8%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had $960.5 million of notes payable, compared to $931.3 million at December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense for a full year on the indebtedness associated with our 275 Brannan property, the indebtedness associated with the Pinnacle II building acquired on June 14, 2013, the indebtedness associated with the acquisition of the Seattle Portfolio, the indebtedness associated with the redevelopments of our Element LA property, and amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, all partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 625 Second Street property on November 1, 2013, and our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood property on October 1, 2014 and additional capitalized interest related to our redevelopment properties as compared to the same period last year.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $3.2 million, or 221.0%, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of acquisition costs related to the upcoming purchase of the EOP Northern California portfolio compared to by the acquisition costs related to the purchase of the Seattle portfolio in 2013.\nGain on sale of real estate. On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Tierrasanta property for $19.5 million (before certain credits, prorations, and closing costs). Accordingly, the Company recognized $5.5 million of gain on sale of real estate relates the current year with no comparable activity in the same period a year ago.\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company sold its City Plaza property in Orange, California, for approximately $56.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). Accordingly, the City Plaza property was reclassified as held for sale and its financial results are accounted for as discontinued operations for each of the periods presented. The Company also recognized $5.6 million of impairment loss in the year ended December 31, 2013, with no comparable activity in the current year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had approximately $53.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 20, 2015, we closed the public offering of 12,650,000 shares of our common stock. We used $130.0 million of proceeds from that stock offering to fully pay down the $130.0 million outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total borrowing capacity of $400.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $230.0 million of which had been drawn.\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a New Term Loan Agreement that will allow us to draw $175.0 million related to a 5-year term loan and $125.0 million under a 7-year term loan. As of December 31, 2015 none of these amounts have been drawn.\nWe have an ATM program which allows us to sell up to $125.0 million of common stock, $14.5 million of which has been sold as of December 31, 2015.\nWe intend to use the unsecured revolving credit facility, New Term Loan Agreement and ATM program, among other things, to finance the acquisition of other properties, to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes.\nBased on the closing price of our common stock of $28.14 as of December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately 35.7% (counting series A preferred units as debt) as of December 31, 2015. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio), including restricted stock that we may issue to certain of our directors and executive officers, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series A preferred units, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT status, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash\non hand, net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, by drawing upon our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our unsecured revolving credit facility pending permanent financing.\nWe believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness creates the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding notes payable of $2.28 billion (before $1.3 million loan premium and $19.0 million of deferred finance costs), of which $1.34 billion, or 58.8%, was variable rate debt. $806.5 million of the variable rate debt is subject to the interest rate contracts described in Part IV, Item 15(a) Financial Statement and Schedules-Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Interest Rate Contracts\u201d.\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 with respect to the Company's outstanding indebtedness.

The increase was primarily\nattributable to an increase in cash NOI, as defined, from our office properties, primarily from the EOP Acquisition, increased occupancy and higher rental revenue from our 1455 Market, Rincon Center, Element LA, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014. The increase was also attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in leasing costs primarily related to our Element LA property, increase in general and administrative expenses, increase in interest expense due to $1.3 billion of borrowing associated with the acquisition of the EOP Northern California portfolio and an increase in acquisition-related costs associated with the EOP Acquisition as compared to the year-end December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,551.3 million or 629.7% to $1,797.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $246.4 million for year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the EOP Acquisition, the acquisition of 4th & Traction and the acquisition of 405 Mateo during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investing activities was partially offset by the cash provided by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and the sale of our Bay Park Plaza asset on September 29, 2015 offset by the sale of Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,488.1 million or 872.3% to $1,658.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the $1.3 billion of borrowings associated with the EOP Acquisition, an increase in total proceeds generated by the issuance of common equity securities, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $385.6 million (before transaction costs) in 2015, compared to the issuance of equity securities generating total proceeds, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $197.5 million (before transaction costs) in 2014 and an increase in total net proceeds from our joint venture at our 1455 Market property of $217.8 million. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of our Series B preferred stock on December 10, 2015 for approximately $147.3 million, an increase in repayment of debt, an increase in dividends paid to common stock and unitholders and an increase in loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets.\nWe believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs.\nImplicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide.\nHowever, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.\nThe following table presents our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and a reconciliation of FFO to net income (loss):\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n</td> <td>244,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from Sale of Real Estate\n</td> <td>(30,471\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,538\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>(14,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to preferred stock and units\n</td> <td>(12,105\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,785\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO to common stockholders and unit holders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

(our operating partnership) and its subsidiaries, at December 31, 2015, our consolidated office portfolio consisted of approximately 14.0 million square feet of in-service, redevelopment, development and held for sale properties, and our media and entertainment portfolio consisted of 0.9 million square feet. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated in-service office portfolio was 90.1% leased (including leases not yet commenced). Our media and entertainment properties were 78.5% leased for the trailing 12-month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCurrent Year Acquisitions, Dispositions, Held for Sale, Redevelopment and Financings\nAcquisitions\nEOP Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2015, we completed the EOP Acquisition from Blackstone. The EOP Acquisition consisted of 26 high-quality office assets totaling approximately 8.2 million square feet and two development parcels located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, proration, and closing costs included a cash payment of $1.75 billion (financed largely with proceeds received from our January 2015 common equity offering and $1.30 billion of new term debt), and an aggregate of 63,474,791 shares of common stock and common units.\n4th & Traction\nOn May 22, 2015, we acquired a three-story, 120,937-square-foot former manufacturing facility known as 4th & Traction in Los Angeles, California for $49.3 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). We funded this off-market transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n405 Mateo\nOn August 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 405 Mateo, a three-building, 83,285-square-foot redevelopment project in Downtown Los Angeles' Arts District for $40.0 million (before credits, prorations, and closing costs). We funded this transaction with proceeds from our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nDispositions\nFirst Financial\nOn March 6, 2015, we sold our First Financial office property for $89.0 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $46.0 million after repayment of a $43.0 million loan secured by the property (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The proceeds were used pursuant to a like-kind Section 1031 exchange in connection with the EOP Acquisition.\nBay Park Plaza\nOn September 29, 2015, we sold our Bay Park Plaza office property for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our two-year term loan facility.\nHeld for Sale\nOn December 10, 2015, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our Bayhill office property for $215.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). As a result, we have reclassified its assets and liabilities to held for sale as of December 31, 2015. The transaction closed on January 14, 2016.\nRedevelopment\nWe select a property for redevelopment when we believe the result of doing so will render a higher economic return on the property. We may engage in the development or redevelopment of office properties when market conditions support a favorable risk-adjusted return. A redevelopment can consist of a range of improvements to a property, and may constitute a complete structural renovation of a building or remodeling select areas to make the property more attractive to tenants. Properties that undergo such renovations are excluded from our in-service portfolio to maintain consistency in evaluating our performance from period to period. The redevelopment process generally occurs over the course of several months or years, and requires significant development and construction costs. Commonly associated with newly-acquired properties, redevelopment efforts may also occur at properties we currently own. During 2015, there were a total of seven properties classified as under redevelopment: Merrill Place Theater Building, Patrick Henry Drive, 875 Howard (1st Floor), 12655 Jefferson, 3402 Pico (Existing), 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo. Of this group, 4th & Traction and 405 Mateo were acquired in 2015 for the purpose of redevelopment.\nFinancings\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facilities\nA&R Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2015 (the A&R Credit Facilities\u201d), which amended and restated our existing $300.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $150.0 million unsecured term loan facility to, among other things, extend the term, increase the unsecured revolving credit facility to $400.0 million and the unsecured 5-year term loan facility to $550.0 million, and add a $350.0 million unsecured 7-year term loan facility. The 5-year term loan and the 7-year term loan were fully drawn and used towards the EOP Acquisition. The unsecured revolving credit facility is available for other purposes, including for the payment of pre-development and development costs incurred in connection with properties owned by our operating partnership or any subsidiary, to finance capital expenditures and the repayment for indebtedness of the Company, and its subsidiaries, to provide for general working capital needs of the Company, our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the A&R Credit Facilities.\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 1, 2015, we entered into a New Credit Agreement (the New Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a $550.0 million unsecured 2-year term loan credit facility (the Two-Year Term Loan\u201d), which was fully drawn by us on the date of the New Credit Agreement to consummate the EOP Acquisition, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with that acquisition and the Two-Year Term Loan.\nThe entire balance of the Two-Year Term Loan was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2015 with the proceeds from the Bay Park Plaza disposition, excess cash from the Element LA refinancing, and proceeds from the $425.0 million private placement described below. Amounts paid down are no longer available for re-borrowing.\nElement LA Refinancing\nOn October 9, 2015, we entered into and closed a ten-year mortgage loan in the amount of $168.0 million, secured by the Element L.A. campus. The purpose of the loan was to fully refinance an existing construction loan secured by Element L.A. that was scheduled to mature on November 1, 2017. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Two-Year Term Loan. The loan is interest only and is payable monthly at a fixed rate of 4.59% per annum. No prepayment is allowed until three months prior to the maturity date. Defeasance is permitted (at Borrower's cost) after the earlier of: (x) two years after securitization or (y) three years after the closing of the Loan. The loan is non-recourse, subject to customary carve-outs. In addition, the loan agreement includes events of default that we believe are usual for loans and transactions of this type.\nNote Purchase Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which provides for the private placement of $425.0 million of senior guaranteed notes by our operating partnership, of which (i) $110.0 million are designated as 4.34% Series A Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2, 2023 (the Series A Notes\u201d), (ii) $259.0 million are designated as 4.69% Series B Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2025 (the Series B Notes\u201d) and (iii) $56.0 million are designated as 4.79% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 16, 2027 (the Series C Notes\u201d, and collectively with the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, the Notes\u201d). The Notes were issued on December 16, 2015. Proceeds from the Notes were used toward the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Two-Year Term Loan with the remainder used toward the repayment of our revolving credit facility.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the New Term Loan Agreement\u201d) which provides for (i) an unsecured 5-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $175.0 million (the 5-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) an unsecured 7-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $125.0 million ( the 7-Year Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Company intends to use the amounts available under the 5-Year Term Loan Facility and the 7-Year Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, repay other outstanding secured or unsecured indebtedness, or for general corporate purposes.\nRedemption of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn December 10, 2015, we redeemed all 5,800,000 shares of our issued and outstanding 8.375% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock for a total redemption price of approximately $147.3 million. We funded the redemption using borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFactors That May Influence Our Operating Results\nBusiness and Strategy\nWe focus our investment strategy on office properties located in submarkets with growth potential as well as on underperforming properties or portfolios that provide opportunities to implement a value-add strategy to increase occupancy rates and cash flow. Additionally, we intend to acquire properties or portfolios that are distressed due to near-term debt maturities or underperforming properties where we believe better management, focused leasing efforts and/or capital improvements would improve the property's operating performance and value. Our strategy also includes active management, aggressive leasing efforts, focused capital improvement programs, the reduction and containment of operating costs and an emphasis on tenant satisfaction, which we believe will minimize turnover costs and improve occupancy.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties as a key part of our growth strategy, often including properties that may have substantial vacancy, which enables us to increase cash flow through lease-up. We expect to continue to acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to incur indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any dividends with respect to our common stock, common units and series A preferred units.\nRental Revenue\nThe amount of net rental revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from lease terminations. As of December 31, 2015, the percent leased for our in-service office properties was approximately 90.1% (or 88.8%, excluding leases signed but not commenced as of that date), and the percent leased for the media and entertainment properties (based on 12-month trailing average) was approximately 78.5%. The amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. We believe that the average rental rates for our office properties are generally below the current average quoted market rate. We believe the average rental rates for our media and entertainment properties are generally equal to current average quoted market rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. Future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets or downturns in our tenants' industries that impair our ability to renew or re-let space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties. In addition, growth in rental revenue will also partially depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are all located in California and Pacific Northwest submarkets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions in California or Pacific Northwest, including state budgetary shortfalls, employment rates, natural hazards and other factors, may impact our overall performance.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, insurance and site maintenance costs. Increases in these expenses over tenants' base years are generally passed on to tenants in our full-service gross leased properties and are generally paid in full by tenants in our net lease properties. Certain of our properties have been reassessed for property tax purposes as a result of our initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition and other reassessments remain pending. In the case of completed reassessments, the amount of property taxes we pay reflects the valuations established with the county assessors for the relevant locations of each property as of the initial public offering or their subsequent acquisition. With respect to pending reassessments, we similarly expect the amount of property taxes we pay to reflect the valuations established with such county assessors.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs part of the formation transactions, we formed Hudson Pacific Services, Inc., or our services company, a Maryland corporation that is wholly owned by our operating partnership. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes, and we may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. Our services company generally may provide both customary and non-customary services to our tenants and engage in other activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT. Our services company and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide a number of services to certain tenants at our media and entertainment properties and, from time to time, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries may provide services to our tenants at these and other properties. In addition, our operating partnership has contributed some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. We currently lease space to wholly owned subsidiaries of our services company at our media and entertainment properties and may, from time to time, enter into additional leases with one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable), as a regular C corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nInvestment in Real Estate Properties\nAcquisitions\nWhen we acquire properties that are considered business combinations, the purchase price is assigned to various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components include but are not limited to land, building and improvements, intangible assets related to above-and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. The initial assignment of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price assignment are made within the assignment period, which typically does not exceed one year, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe assess fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\nThe fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. The fair value of acquired above-and below-\u201d market leases are based on the estimated cash flow projections utilizing discount rates that reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rents at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Acquisition-related expenses associated with business combinations are expensed in the period incurred.\nCost Capitalization\nWe capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a real estate project. Indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits, office rent, and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities are also capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Construction and development costs are capitalized while substantial activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year after cessation of major construction activity. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, or after development activities have ceased, are expensed as they are incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisitions or developments are charged to earnings. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as they are incurred.\nOperating Properties\nThe properties are generally carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of generally 39 years for building and improvements, 15 years for land improvements, five or seven years for furniture and fixtures and equipment, and over the shorter of asset life or life of the lease for tenant improvements. Above- and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to revenue over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms and bargain renewal periods, if applicable. Other in-place lease intangibles are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). Impairment losses are recorded on real estate assets held for investment\nwhen indicators of impairment are present and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. We recognize impairment losses to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the properties. We recorded no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due for monthly rents and other charges. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of its tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of uncollectible accounts and our historical collection experience. We recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and our historical experience. Historical experience has been within management's expectations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize rental revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. \nCertain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant's revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized only after the contingency has been removed (when the related thresholds are achieved), which may result in the recognition of rental revenue in periods subsequent to when such payments are received.\nOther property-related revenue is revenue that is derived from the tenants' use of lighting, equipment rental, parking, power, HVAC and telecommunications (telephone and internet). Other property-related revenue is recognized when these items are provided.\nTenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented gross, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the associated credit risk.\nWe recognize gains on sales of properties upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Gains on properties sold are recognized using the full accrual method when (i) the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, (ii) We are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and (iv) other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the total compensation expense for time-vested shares on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant of our restricted shares.\nThe cost of our Outperformance Program ( OPP\u201d) is subject to a forfeiture adjustment and is amortized through the final vesting period under a graded vesting expense recognition schedule. The costs were valued in accordance with ASC 718, utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the performance vesting conditions being satisfied. The Monte Carlo simulation used a statistical formula underlying the Black-Scholes and binomial formulas and such simulation was run 100,000 times. For each simulation, the payoff is calculated at the settlement date, which is then discounted to the award date at a risk-free interest rate. The average of the values over all simulations is the expected value of the unit on the award date. Assumptions used in the valuations included (1) factors associated with the underlying performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return over the term of the performance awards, including total stock return volatility and risk-free interest. and (2) factors associated with the relative performance of the Company's stock price and total stockholder return when compared to the SNL Equity REIT Index. The valuation was performed in a risk-neutral framework, so no assumption was made with respect to an equity risk premium. The fair value of the OPP awards is based on the sum of: (1) the present value of the expected payoff to the awards on the measurement date, if the TSR over the applicable measurement period exceeds performance hurdles of the absolute and the relative TSR components; and (2) the present value of the distributions payable on the awards. The ultimate reward realized on account of the OPP awards by the holders of the awards is contingent on the TSR achieved on the measurement date, both in absolute terms and relative to the TSR of the SNL Equity REIT Index.\nOur compensation committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs.\nIncome Taxes\nOur property-owning subsidiaries are limited liability companies and are treated as pass-through entities or disregarded entities (or, in the case of the entity that owns the 1455 Market Street property, a REIT) for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the activities of these entities.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that we have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such manner. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.\nProvided that we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.\nWe have elected, together with one of our subsidiaries, to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. Certain activities that we may undertake, such as non-customary services for our tenants and holding assets that we cannot hold directly, will be conducted by a TRS. A TRS is subject to federal and, where applicable, state income taxes on its net income.\nWe are subject to the statutory requirements of the states in which we conduct business.\nWe periodically evaluate our tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. As of December 31, 2015, we have not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.\nWe and our TRS file income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state and local jurisdictions. We and our TRS are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2011. Generally, we have assessed\nour tax positions for all open years, which include 2011 to 2015, and concluded that there are no material uncertainties to be recognized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table identifies each of the properties in our portfolio acquired through December 31, 2015 and their date of acquisition.\n\n_____________\n(1) We sold a 45% joint venture interest in the 1455 Market property on January 7, 2015.\n(2) We acquired a 98.25% joint venture interest in the Pinnacle I property on November 8, 2012. On June 14, 2013 our joint venture partner contributed its interest in Pinnacle II, which reduced our entire interest in the joint venture to 65.0%.\n(3) Includes Bay Park Plaza, which was sold on September 29, 2015, and Bayhill Office Center, which was sold on January 14, 2016.\n(4) The properties under development were included within acquisitions listed above.\n(5) We estimate this development will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and stabilized in the third quarter of 2018.\n(6) We estimate this development will be completed in the third quarter of 2017 and stabilized in the third quarter of 2018.\n(7) We estimate this development will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 and stabilized in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe following table identifies each of the properties that were part of the EOP Northern California Portfolio acquired from Blackstone on April 1, 2015.\n\n_________________\n(1) Sold on January 14, 2016 and reflected as held for sale on our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015.\nAll amounts and percentages used in this discussion of our results of operations are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this report rather than the rounded numbers appearing in this discussion.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014\nNet Operating Income\nWe evaluate performance based upon property net operating income ( NOI\u201d) from continuing operations. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. All companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items. NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses.\nManagement further evaluates NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups:\n \u2022 Same-Store Properties-which includes all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1, 2014 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of December 31, 2015, \n \u2022 Non-same store properties, development projects, redevelopment properties, and lease-up properties as of December 31, 2015; and other properties not owned or in operation from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. \nThe following tables summarize the Net Operating Income from continuing operations, as defined, for our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n\n\nNet Operating Income increased $181.8 million, or 121.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily resulting from:\n \u2022 A $181.0 million or 1,134.2% increase in net operating income from our non-same-store properties resulting primarily from the EOP Acquisition on April 1, 2015. The remaining increase is as a result of lease-up of our Element LA (Riot Games), 901 Market (Nordstrom Rack, Saks and Company, Nerdwallet), 3401 Exposition (Deluxe Entertainment Services) properties and income from our purchase of the Broadway properties-secured note receivable, which we purchased on August 19, 2014. This increase was partially offset by the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015 and the sale of our Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014. \n \u2022 A $0.8 million or 0.7% decrease in net operating income from our same-store office properties resulting primarily from a decrease in lease termination fees in the current year as compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we received one-time lease termination fees from Fox Interactive ($3.1 million) and The Children's Place ($1.2 million). The decrease was partially offset by the lease-up of our 1455 Market (Uber and Square) and Rincon Center (Sales Force) properties. \n \u2022 A $1.7 million or 12.2% increase in NOI from our same-store media and entertainment properties resulting primarily from the higher rental revenue generated by strong occupancy and heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property, partially offset by our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate our ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property. \nThe year-over-year changes in the items that comprise same-store net operating income are primarily attributable to the factors discussed below.\nSame-Store Office:\nOffice rental revenue increased $6.2 million or 4.5% to $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $136.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Square) and Rincon Center (Sales Force) properties at higher rents than expiring leases, partially offset by a one-time GAAP straight line rent write-off at our Howard Street property (Heald College).\nOffice tenant recoveries decreased by $5.2 million or 15.9% to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily related to $3.6 million of\none-time property tax recoveries resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and\nto a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014.\nOffice parking and other revenue decreased by $4.2 million or 21.3% to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a one time termination fee at our 625 Second Street (Fox interactive) and 222 Kearny (The Children's Place) properties recognized in 2014.\nOffice operating expenses decreased by $2.3 million or 3.3% to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to one time property tax expenses of $4.7 million resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by increases in operating expenses across all same store properties.\nSame-Store Media & Entertainment:\nMedia and entertainment rental revenue, tenant recoveries and other property-related revenue decreased by $0.5 million or 1.3% to $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses decreased $2.2 million, or 8.4%, to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is the result of our decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate the ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by additional lighting expense in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $10.3 million, or 36.4%, to $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2015 OPP Plan and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth related to the EOP Acquisition, which was completed on April 1, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $172.9 million, or 239.4%, to $245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to depreciation expenses associated with the EOP Acquisition on April 1, 2015. The remaining increase is a result of the assets associated with the early termination of a tenant at our Howard Street property, lease-up of our Element LA, 1455 Market, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the reduction of depreciation expense as a result of the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015 and sale of our Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $24.7 million, or 95.4%, to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had $2,278.4 million, before deferred loan costs recorded as a net against the loan balance, of notes payable, compared to $957.5 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.3 billion of term loan borrowings used to finance the EOP Acquisition, partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood, 275 Brannan and First and King properties and repayment of debt associated with the sale of our First Financial property on March 5, 2015.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $38.7 million, or 833.8%, to $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily as a result of acquisition costs related to the EOP Acquisition.\nGain on sale of real estate increase by $24.9 million, or 450.2% to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.5 million or the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gain on sale is a result of the sales of First Financial on March 5, 2015 for $89.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) and Bay Park Plaza on September 29, 2015 for $90.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) generating $30.5 million of gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a $5.5 million gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the sale of our Tierrasanta property for $19.5 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs) on July 16, 2014.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nThe following tables summarize the Net Operating Income from continuing operations, as defined, for our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:\n\n\nNet Operating Income increased $31.2 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily resulting from:\n \u2022 A $27.0 million or 112.2% increase in net operating income from our non-same store properties primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Pinnacle II property and the Seattle portfolio in 2013 and the Merrill Place property in 2014. \n \u2022 A $6.4 million or 8.2% increase in net operating income from our same-store properties primarily as a result of the lease-up in our 1455 Market and Rincon properties. \n \u2022 A $2.2 million or 14.0% decrease in net operating income from our same-store media and entertainment properties as a result of the Company's decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher rental revenue and tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy and heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property. \nThe year-over-year changes in the items that comprise same store net operating income are primarily attributable to the factors discussed below.\nSame-Store Office:\nOffice rental revenue increased $7.9 million or 8.4% to $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market and Rincon Center properties at higher rents than expiring leases partially offset by lower rental income from our 625 second street property as a result of an early termination from Fox Interactive Media, Inc. at our 625 Second Street property.\nOffice tenant recoveries increased by $2.4 million or 10.8% to $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a $3.3 million of one-time property tax recovery resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to this year, partially offset by lower\nrecoveries at our 1455 Market property due to a change from a triple-net recovery structure from Bank of America to a modified gross recovery structure for Uber and Square tenants.\nOffice parking and other revenue increased by $3.2 million or 27.1% to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a one-time termination fee at our 625 Second Street (Fox interactive) and 222 Kearny (The Children's Place) properties recognized in 2014, offset by a decrease in termination fees at our 1455 Market property recognized in 2013.\nOffice operating expenses increased by $7.1 million or 14.1% to $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to a one-time property tax expense resulting from the resulting from the reassessment of the 1455 Market Street and Rincon Center properties, and to a lesser extent other assets within the San Francisco portfolio, for all applicable periods prior to this year.\nSame-Store Media & Entertainment:\nMedia and entertainment rental revenue decreased by $0.9 million or 3.8% to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the Company's decision to take certain buildings and stages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher rental revenue generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment tenant recoveries decreased by $0.7 million or 37.6% to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease is primarily due to the Company's decision to take certain buildings and sages off-line to facilitate its ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property, partially offset by higher tenant recoveries generated by strong occupancy at the Sunset Gower property.\nMedia and entertainment other property-related revenue increased by $0.7 million or 4.5% to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nMedia and entertainment other revenue increased by $0.4 million or 160.4% to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to increase in operating income from our United Recording studio operations.\nMedia and entertainment operating expenses increased $1.7 million, or 7.2%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect a property tax reimbursement resulting from the reassessment of the Sunset Gower media and entertainment property of $0.8 million, with no comparable activity for the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining difference relates additional lighting expense incurred in connection with the heightened production activity at the Sunset Gower property for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOther Expense (Income)\nGeneral and administrative expenses includes wages and salaries for corporate level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel, and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million, or 41.6%, to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2014 Outperformance Program, the costs associated with a one-year consulting arrangement with a former executive, and increased staffing to meet operational needs stemming from growth through the acquisition of office properties.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million, or 3.1%, to $72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of the Pinnacle II building by our joint venture with MDP/Worthe on June 14, 2013, our acquisition of the Seattle portfolio on July 31, 2013, and our acquisition of the Merrill Place property on February 12, 2014.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 1.8%, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had $960.5 million of notes payable, compared to $931.3 million at December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense for a full year on the indebtedness associated with our 275 Brannan property, the indebtedness associated with the Pinnacle II building acquired on June 14, 2013, the indebtedness associated with the acquisition of the Seattle Portfolio, the indebtedness associated with the redevelopments of our Element LA property, and amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, all partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 625 Second Street property on November 1, 2013, and our repayment of indebtedness associated with our 6922 Hollywood property on October 1, 2014 and additional capitalized interest related to our redevelopment properties as compared to the same period last year.\nAcquisition-related expenses increased $3.2 million, or 221.0%, to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of acquisition costs related to the upcoming purchase of the EOP Northern California portfolio compared to by the acquisition costs related to the purchase of the Seattle portfolio in 2013.\nGain on sale of real estate. On July 16, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Tierrasanta property for $19.5 million (before certain credits, prorations, and closing costs). Accordingly, the Company recognized $5.5 million of gain on sale of real estate relates the current year with no comparable activity in the same period a year ago.\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company sold its City Plaza property in Orange, California, for approximately $56.0 million (before certain credits, prorations and closing costs). Accordingly, the City Plaza property was reclassified as held for sale and its financial results are accounted for as discontinued operations for each of the periods presented. The Company also recognized $5.6 million of impairment loss in the year ended December 31, 2013, with no comparable activity in the current year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had approximately $53.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 20, 2015, we closed the public offering of 12,650,000 shares of our common stock. We used $130.0 million of proceeds from that stock offering to fully pay down the $130.0 million outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total borrowing capacity of $400.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $230.0 million of which had been drawn.\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into a New Term Loan Agreement that will allow us to draw $175.0 million related to a 5-year term loan and $125.0 million under a 7-year term loan. As of December 31, 2015 none of these amounts have been drawn.\nWe have an ATM program which allows us to sell up to $125.0 million of common stock, $14.5 million of which has been sold as of December 31, 2015.\nWe intend to use the unsecured revolving credit facility, New Term Loan Agreement and ATM program, among other things, to finance the acquisition of other properties, to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes.\nBased on the closing price of our common stock of $28.14 as of December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately 35.7% (counting series A preferred units as debt) as of December 31, 2015. Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio), including restricted stock that we may issue to certain of our directors and executive officers, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series A preferred units, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT status, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash\non hand, net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, by drawing upon our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our unsecured revolving credit facility pending permanent financing.\nWe believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness creates the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding notes payable of $2.28 billion (before $1.3 million loan premium and $19.0 million of deferred finance costs), of which $1.34 billion, or 58.8%, was variable rate debt. $806.5 million of the variable rate debt is subject to the interest rate contracts described in Part IV, Item 15(a) Financial Statement and Schedules-Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Interest Rate Contracts\u201d.\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 with respect to the Company's outstanding indebtedness. \n_________________\n (1) Interest rate with respect to indebtedness is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, excluding the amortization of loan fees and costs. Interest rates are as of December 31, 2015, which may be different than the interest rates as of December 31, 2014 for corresponding indebtedness. \n (2) We have the option to make an irrevocable election to change the interest rate depending on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2015, no such election has been made. \n (3) Effective May 1, 2015, $300.0 million of the $550.0 million term loan has been effectively fixed at 2.66% to 3.56% through the use of an interest rate swap. See Part IV. Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details. \n (4) Effective May 1, 2015, the outstanding balance of the term loan has been effectively fixed at 3.21% to 4.16% through the use of an interest rate swap. See Part IV. Note 6 the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details. \n (5) This loan bore interest only for the first five years. Beginning with the payment due October 6, 2011, monthly debt service includes annual debt amortization payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. \n (6) Represents unamortized amount of the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment. \n (7) Monthly debt service includes annual debt amortization payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. \n (8) Interest on $92.0 million of the outstanding loan balance has been effectively capped at 5.97% and 4.25% on $50.0 million and $42.0 million, respectively, of the loan through the use of two interest rate caps through February 11, 2016. See Part IV. Note 6 for details. \n (9) The maturity date may be extended once for an additional one-year term. \n (10) This loan bears interest only. Interest on the full loan amount has been effectively fixed at 3.71% through use of an interest rate swap. See Part IV. Note 6 the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details. \n (11) This loan bears interest only for the first five years. Beginning with the payment due December 6, 2017, monthly debt service will include annual debt amortization payments based on a 30-year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. \n (12) This loan has been recorded as part of the liabilities associated with real estate held for sale as of December 31, 2014. The property was sold in 2015. \nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information with respect to our commitments at December 31, 2015, including any guaranteed or minimum commitments under contractual obligations.\n\n_________________\n (1) Interest rates with respect to indebtedness are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Reflects our projected interest obligations for fixed rate debts. \n (2) Interest rates with respect to indebtedness are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Reflects our projected interest obligations for variable rate debts, including those that are effectively fixed as a result of interest rate contracts and in instances where interest is paid based on a LIBOR margin, we used the average December LIBOR and current margin based on the leverage ratio as of December 31, 2015. \n (3) Reflects minimum lease payments through the contractual lease expiration date before the impact of extension options. Refer to Part IV, Item 15(a) Financial Statement and Schedules-Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Future Minimum Rent and Lease Payments\u201d for details of our ground lease agreements. \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flows\nCash Flows\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $53.6 million and $17.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $111.7 million or 176.8% to $174.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $63.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily\nattributable to an increase in cash NOI, as defined, from our office properties, primarily from the EOP Acquisition, increased occupancy and higher rental revenue from our 1455 Market, Rincon Center, Element LA, 901 Market Street and 3401 Exposition properties, partially offset by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014. The increase was also attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in leasing costs primarily related to our Element LA property, increase in general and administrative expenses, increase in interest expense due to $1.3 billion of borrowing associated with the acquisition of the EOP Northern California portfolio and an increase in acquisition-related costs associated with the EOP Acquisition as compared to the year-end December 31, 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1,551.3 million or 629.7% to $1,797.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $246.4 million for year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the EOP Acquisition, the acquisition of 4th & Traction and the acquisition of 405 Mateo during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investing activities was partially offset by the cash provided by the sale of our First Financial property on March 6, 2015 and the sale of our Bay Park Plaza asset on September 29, 2015 offset by the sale of Tierrasanta property on July 16, 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $1,488.1 million or 872.3% to $1,658.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the $1.3 billion of borrowings associated with the EOP Acquisition, an increase in total proceeds generated by the issuance of common equity securities, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $385.6 million (before transaction costs) in 2015, compared to the issuance of equity securities generating total proceeds, after underwriters' discounts, of approximately $197.5 million (before transaction costs) in 2014 and an increase in total net proceeds from our joint venture at our 1455 Market property of $217.8 million. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of our Series B preferred stock on December 10, 2015 for approximately $147.3 million, an increase in repayment of debt, an increase in dividends paid to common stock and unitholders and an increase in loan costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets.\nWe believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs.\nImplicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide.\nHowever, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.\nThe following table presents our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and a reconciliation of FFO to net income (loss):\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual or Estimated Acquisition\nDate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consideration Paid\n(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predecessor properties:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>875 Howard Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/15/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Gower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/17/2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>545,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sunset Bronson\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1/30/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technicolor Building\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/1/2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties acquired after initial public offering:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Del Amo Office\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/13/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9300 Wilshire Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/24/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>222 Kearny Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/8/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1455 Market(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rincon Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/16/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>580,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10950 Washington\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/22/2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>604 Arizona\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7/26/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>275 Brannan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8/19/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>625 Second Street\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/1/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6922 Hollywood Blvd.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/22/2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6050 Sunset Blvd. & 1445 N.

million increase in non-same-store NOI due to the acquisition of the EOP Northern California Portfolio. \n\n- Same-store office NOI decreased slightly by 0.7% due to lower lease termination fees compared to 2014. Same-store media/entertainment NOI increased 12.2% due to higher rental revenue.\n\n- General and administrative expenses increased 36.4% in 2015 due to adoption of a new performance program, increased staffing, and growth from acquisitions. \n\n- Depreciation and amortization increased 239.4% in 2015 primarily due to the EOP acquisition. Interest expense also increased 95.4% due to debt associated with the EOP acquisition.\n\n- Cash from operations increased 176.8% in 2015 driven by increased NOI and accounts payable, partially offset by higher interest, G&A, and leasing costs. \n\n- Cash used in investing increased 629.7% in 2015 primarily due to the EOP acquisition and other property purchases. Cash from financing increased 872.3% mainly due to debt and equity raised for the EOP acquisition.\n\n- At December 31, 2015, the company had total debt outstanding of $2.28 billion, of which 58.8% was variable rate. The company has total borrowing capacity of $400 million on its credit facility.\n\n- Funds from operations (FFO) increased 155.0% to $183.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, largely driven by the EOP acquisition."}
