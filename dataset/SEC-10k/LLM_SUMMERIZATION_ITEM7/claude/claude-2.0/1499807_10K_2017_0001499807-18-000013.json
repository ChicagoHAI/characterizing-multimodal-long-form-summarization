MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 1A - Risk Factors; Item 6 - Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Part I - Forward Looking Statements. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per procedure as compared to other spine surgery procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and commercialization of an expanding number of proprietary minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We have also leveraged these core competencies in the design, development and commercialization of an increasing number of products for patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.\nWe categorize our revenue in the United States among revenue generated from the treatment of complex spine pathologies, treatment using MIS approaches and the treatment of degenerative spinal conditions. We define our complex spine procedures as those that involve the treatment of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity, trauma and tumor. We consider MIS procedures to be degenerative procedures done through minimally invasive approaches designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We categorize degenerative procedures as those involving traditional non-MIS products treating degenerative spinal conditions such as traditional spinal fusions and certain single-use MIS products which are sold in support of degenerative surgical procedures. We report revenue related to the sale of biomaterials as part of our complex spine, MIS and degenerative spine revenue categories. We expect our revenue to continue to be driven by aggregate sales growth in all categories. Our revenue classifications may evolve as we grow our business, continue to commercialize new products, adapt to surgeon preferences and surgical techniques and expand our sales globally.\nThe primary market for our products has been the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico, where we sell our products through a hybrid sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies. As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. sales force consisted of 117 direct sales employees and 109 independent sales agencies, who distribute our products and are compensated through a combination of base salaries, individual and company-based performance bonuses, commissions and equity awards. We do not sell our products through or participate in PODs.\nWe also market and sell our products internationally in 40 countries. We sell our products directly in certain markets such as the United Kingdom and Germany, use independent sales agencies in Italy and Canada and through independent distributors in other markets such as Australia, Japan and Spain. For 2017, international sales accounted for approximately 23.5% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2017, our international sales force consisted of 41 direct sales employees, 10 independent sales agencies and 25 independent distributors. Our independent distributors manage the billing relationship with each hospital in their respective territories and are responsible for servicing the product needs of their surgeon customers. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence through the expansion of our distribution network and the commercialization of additional products or product line extensions. In 2017, revenue denominated in currencies other than in U.S. Dollars from our international direct markets represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nRevenue\nWe market and sell spinal implants, disposables and instruments, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat patients with spinal pathologies. In the United States and the international markets where we have direct employee sales locations,\nwhich include the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we manage and maintain the sales relationships with our hospital customers. In those international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we do not manage or maintain the sales relationships with the hospital customers. We do, however, support our distributor partners by providing product training, medical education and engineering expertise to surgeons practicing in these markets.\nIn markets where we have a direct presence, we generally assign our surgical sets to our direct sales employees. A surgical set typically contains the instruments, including any disposables, and spinal implants necessary to complete a successful surgery. With our support, the direct sales employee maintains the surgical sets and places them with our hospital customers for use by surgeons. We recognize revenue upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of the surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we generally sell our surgical sets and the related spinal implant replenishments to our distributors on pre-agreed business terms. We recognize revenue when the title to the goods and the risk of loss related to those goods are transferred to the distributor, typically at the time of shipment from our operations center. All such sales to distributors are not subject to contingencies and are, therefore, final. International revenue was 23.5%, 23.5% and 28.1% of total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe generated 56.2%, 55.6% and 56.0% of our U.S. revenue from the sale of our complex spine and MIS products for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that these core product categories will continue to be significant contributors to our revenue growth in the future.\nWhile we believe the proportion of our international revenue from complex spine and MIS is higher than in the United States, a significant portion of our international revenue is derived from our distributor partners who do not report their product usage at the surgeon or hospital level, which prevents us from providing a specific breakdown for our international revenue among our three product categories.\nCost of Revenue\nExcept for certain specialty products that we manufacture in-house, our instruments, spinal implants and related offerings are manufactured to our specifications by third-party suppliers who meet our manufacturer qualification standards. Our third-party manufacturers meet FDA, ISO and other country-specific quality standards supported by our internal specifications and procedures. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, amortization of surgical instruments, inventory reserves, royalties, inbound shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Cost of revenue also includes related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute terms due primarily to increased sales volume and changes in the geographic mix of our sales as our international operations tend to have a higher cost of revenue as a percentage of sales.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of research and development, engineering, product development, clinical expenses, regulatory expenses, related consulting services, third-party prototyping services, outside research activities, materials production and other costs associated with the design and development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect to incur additional costs as we continue to design and commercialize new products. While our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of specific research, development and testing initiatives, we generally expect these costs will increase in absolute terms over time as we continue to expand our product portfolio and add related personnel.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of commissions to our independent distributors, as well as compensation, commissions, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel employed in our sales, marketing and clinical sales support departments. Sales and marketing also includes the costs of medical education, training, sales related shipping and corporate communications activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute terms due to increased sales volume, the continued expansion of our sales force and the continued commercialization of new products.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in our executive management, finance, regulatory, IT, legal and human resource departments, as well as facility costs and costs associated with consulting and other finance, legal, IT and human resource services provided by third parties. We include legal and litigation expenses as well as costs related to the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio in general and administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel to support the growth of our business. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of no longer being an emerging growth company\u201d. General and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate and/or generate revenue. The effective income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) was enacted, impacting taxpayers in the United States. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. As a result of this change, our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported at December 31, 2017 using the newly enacted federal corporate rate. As a result, we reported a $1.4 million income tax benefit in 2017.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nThe global spinal surgery industry has been growing as a result of:\nTable 322: <table><tr><td>

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by $16.7 million in greater sales volume from new surgeon users in the United States and a $8.4 million increase as surgeons upgraded to our newest product offerings in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in revenue in certain international markets, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, and India. The increases in the United States were offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our existing customer base.\nU.S. Revenue\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our U.S. revenue by product category expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and percentages.\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Complex spine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimally invasive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degenerative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. revenue increased $16.2 million, or 9.0% to $197.3 million for 2017 from $181.1 million for 2016. Sales in our complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 39.3%, 16.9% and 43.9% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2017 compared to 39.7%, 15.9% and 44.4% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2016. The overall U.S. revenue growth was driven by increased revenue from new surgeon users of $16.7 million and existing surgeons upgrading to our newest product offerings of $8.4 million. The complex spine category growth of $5.6 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $6.7 million and increased usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $1.4 million. The MIS category growth of $4.5 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST minimally invasive products of $2.5 million and increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $3.9 million. The degenerative category growth of $6.1 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $6.4 million and increased surgeon usage of our biomaterials portfolio of $2.1 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue increased $5.2 million, or 9.3%, to $60.7 million for 2017 from $55.6 million for 2016. International revenue increased primarily as a result of increased surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Denmark, as well as increased surgical volumes in Germany and Italy, partially offset by a reduction in surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Spain, India, and lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $6.5 million, or 7.9%, to $88.6 million for 2017 from $82.2 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, to $14.1 million for 2017 from $13.7 million in 2016. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments. The cost of revenue associated with the medical device excise tax in the United States was approximately $0.0 million and $(0.9) million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of recoveries of excise tax overpayments recognized in 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to 65.6% for 2017, from 65.3% for 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to lower inventory reserve allowances.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3.2%, to $22.2 million for 2017 from $21.5 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $12.0 million, or 10.8%, to $123.4 million for 2017 from $111.4 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased travel expense, and higher shipping expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, or 1.7%, to $57.2 million for 2017 from $56.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased spending on outside services and fees, including third-party legal fees and accounting compliance fees. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $6.8 million and $10.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, decreased $1.7 million, or 24.7% to $(5.2) million of expense for 2017 from $(6.9) million for 2016. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.3 million in unrealized gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $2.5 million as a result of a full year's interest expense impact on our convertible senior notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit increased $1.5 million in 2017 to $1.4 million. The increase in the income tax benefit is attributable to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 as a result of lower federal corporate tax rates in the United States which were enacted in December 2017 following passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 3.8% for 2017, as compared to (0.2)% for 2016.\nNet Loss\nNet loss decreased $4.6 million, or 10.8%, to $37.1 million for 2017 from $41.7 million for 2016. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to lower intangible amortization expense and gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,160\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $20.6 million, or 9.5%, to $236.6 million for 2016 from $216.0 million for 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by $16.7 million in greater sales volume from new surgeon users in the United States and a $14.1 million increase as surgeons upgraded to our newest product offerings in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in revenue in our international markets, primarily in Australia, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia and Japan. The increases in the United States were offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our existing customer base.\nU.S. Revenue\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our U.S. revenue by product category expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and percentages:\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Complex spine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimally invasive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degenerative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. revenue increased $25.8 million or 16.6% , to $181.1 million for 2016 from $155.3 million for 2015. Sales in our complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 39.7%, 15.9% and 44.4% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2016, compared to 40.8%, 15.2% and 44.0% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2015. The overall U.S. revenue growth was driven by increased revenue from new surgeon users of $16.7 million and existing surgeons upgrading to our newest product offerings of $14.1 million. The complex spine category growth of $8.5 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems\nof $6.1 million, increased usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $1.5 million, and increased usage of our CAPRI thoraco-lumbar corpectomy device of $0.8 million. The MIS category growth of $5.1 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST minimally invasive products of $3.7 million and increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $3.4 million. The degenerative category growth of $12.2 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $8.8 million and increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $3.5 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue decreased $5.1 million, or (8.5)%, to $55.6 million for 2016 from $60.7 million for 2015. International revenue decreased primarily as a result of reduced surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Saudi Arabia, lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom, and a temporary suspension of our distributor partner in Japan's import registration.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $10.4 million, or 14.5%, to $82.2 million for 2016 from $71.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume and higher inventory reserve allowance. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $1.4 million, or 11.3%, to $13.7 million for 2016 from $12.3 million in 2015. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments. The cost of revenue associated with the medical device excise tax in the United States was approximately $(0.9) million and $0.5 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of recoveries of excise tax overpayments.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased as a percentage of revenue to 65.3% for 2016 from 66.8% for 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to higher inventory reserve allowances and decreased capitalization of overhead costs to inventory.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.6 million, or 8.5%, to $21.5 million for 2016 from $19.9 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline and higher payroll expenses, including stock based compensation.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $5.8 million, or 5.4%, to $111.4 million for 2016 from $105.6 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased employee compensation costs, including stock based compensation from our hiring of direct sales employees since December 31, 2015, and increased shipping expenses as a result of higher surgical volume.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million, or 2.3%, to $56.3 million for 2016 from $55.0 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to employee compensation and benefit costs associated with the increase in personnel to support the expansion of our business, amortization of the compensation cost of restricted stock units issuances, and increases in amortization expense associated with our building under capital lease, partially offset by decreased third-party legal expenses. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $10.4 million and $10.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, increased $4.1 million to $(6.9) million of expense for 2016 from $(2.8) million for 2015. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $3.5 million as a result of our capital lease obligation and a $0.6 million increase in unrealized losses from foreign currency translation on intercompany payable balances.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.1 million to $0.1 million of expense for 2016. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income tax expense was (0.2)% for 2016, from (0.5)% for 2015.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $2.5 million, or 6.2%, to $41.7 million for 2016 from $39.2 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses attributable to greater sales activity.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction (gain) loss.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of our operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(142\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception in 2004, we have incurred significant operating losses and anticipate that our losses will continue in the near term. We expect our operating expenses will continue to grow as we expand our product portfolio and penetrate further into existing markets and enter new markets. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability as we grow our business. Prior to our IPO in May 2014, we had funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred and common stock, notes to stockholders, a revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations.\nOn August 11, 2016, we completed the issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% of convertible senior notes due 2036 for which we received net proceeds of approximately $47.1 million. With a portion of these proceeds, we retired all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility of $19.5 million. The remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. For further details regarding the convertible senior notes, please refer to Indebtedness\u201d below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $24.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 of $45.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit\nfacility and had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $99.6 million, compared to $115.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur principal long-term liquidity need is working capital to support the continued growth of our business through the hiring of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies to expand our global sales force, purchases of additional inventory to support future sales activities and the development and commercialization of new products through our research and development efforts. We expect to fund our long-term capital needs with the proceeds from our stock offerings, convertible senior note issuances, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations. We expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility during the first half of 2018. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through incurring additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds.\nAlthough we believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our long-term capital needs, our liquidity and our ability to fund these needs will depend to a significant extent on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control as discussed in Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements will be our ability to provide attractive products to our customers, changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and changes in the regulatory environment. If these factors change significantly or other unexpected factors adversely affect us, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future financings may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all to meet our liquidity needs.\nIn assessing our liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash-on-hand, the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding, payment terms that we have established with our vendors, sales trends, inventory turns, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditure commitments and income tax rates.\nWe are actively exploring acquisition, investment or strategic partnership opportunities to further enhance our product portfolio or development pipeline for future products. We expect these opportunities may result in additional expense or an increase in intellectual property assets when any such agreements are completed or over the period of development of such technologies. In some cases, the development period of the technologies and related expense may extend multiple years in advance of revenue generation. For instance, in October 2017, we acquired and began to market the PALO ALTO Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System from Cardinal Spine, a privately-held medical device company, for an upfront payment, additional milestone payments should the related milestone conditions be met and a royalty on the net sales of products incorporating certain of the intellectual property acquired.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $0.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017 from $13.3 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a smaller increase in accounts receivable compared to the increase in accounts receivable in the preceding year as a result of the timing of collections from customers in-part offset\nby the increase in inventory balances compared to the preceding year and higher balances of accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $5.0 million to $13.3 million for 2016 from $18.3 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and a smaller increase in inventory than in the preceding year, partially offset by the increase in trade accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue and the timing of customer collections.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $6.5 million to $17.9 million for 2017 from $24.4 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment incurred in 2016 related to the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. This decrease in cash outflows in 2017 was offset by an increase in purchases of surgical instruments and intangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.1 million to $24.4 million for 2016 from $14.3 million for 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment that were placed in service in connection with the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and increased purchases of surgical instruments.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $40.7 million to $8.4 million for 2017 from $49.1 million for 2016. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included principal payments under our capital lease obligation for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and proceeds we received from the exercise of stock-based awards issued mainly to our employees. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to 2016 events that did not occur in 2017. During 2016, we received net proceeds of $47.1 million from our convertible senior notes issuances which did not recur in 2017, partially offset by increases in exercises of benefit plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $7.1 million to $49.1 million for 2016 from $56.2 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of lower proceeds raised in financing events in 2016. During 2016, we issued our convertible senior notes for which we received net proceeds of $47.1 million Notes issuance compared to proceeds from issuances of our common stock of $54.2 million in 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures were $15.0 million, $29.7 million and $13.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisting primarily of purchases of consigned instrumentation to support surgical sales and expansion of our global distribution network, and software and equipment expenditures to support logistics and administration functions. In 2016, we also incurred capital expenditures of approximately $8.9 million net of changes in restricted cash related to the build-out of tenant improvements and purchases of equipment for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. We expect to purchase additional surgical instruments and continue to expand our global distribution network in 2018. We expect to fund our long-term liquidity needs with cash and cash equivalents, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations.\nIndebtedness\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a senior secured credit facilities credit agreement (as amended from time to time) with Silicon Valley Bank and Comerica Bank as Lenders, which is secured primarily by the assets of our operating subsidiaries in the United States and United Kingdom. The credit facility, as amended, consists of a revolving credit facility of $55.0 million with a sub-facility for letters of credit in the aggregate availability amount of $10.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $5.0 million. The credit facility expires on April 26, 2019.\nAlternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to ABR, plus 0.75%. LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) LIBOR, plus 3.0%. The total obligations under the amended credit facility cannot exceed the lesser of (i) the total revolving commitment of $55.0 million or (ii) the borrowing base, which is calculated as (x) 85% of accounts receivable so long as certain of those accounts receivable do not exceed, in the aggregate, 50% of the borrowing base plus (y) 50% of the value of the eligible inventory provided that the contribution of the value of the eligible inventory not exceed the lesser of 40% of the borrowing\nbase or $15.0 million plus (z) up to $7.5 million to the extent the Borrower and its subsidiaries maintain at least $12.5 million on deposit with a lender or an affiliate of a lender. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility remain secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Borrower's personal property assets, including intellectual property.\nThe revolving credit facility contains various financial covenants and negative covenants with which the Company must maintain compliance, including a consolidated adjusted quick ratio for K2M, Inc., K2M UK Limited and select subsidiaries not less than 1.20:1.00 as of the last day of any month, restrictive covenants which limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock and make certain investments, and the provision of certain financial reporting and company information as required. We were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants of the credit facility at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn August 11, 2016, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2036 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes pay interest at an annual rate of 4.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2017, and mature on August 15, 2036, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us. We received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of approximately $47.1 million and used a portion of such proceeds to repay approximately $19.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nNoteholders may convert their Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock; (4) if we call the Notes for redemption and (5) at any time from, and including, February 15, 2036 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 45.7603 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $21.85 per share, and is subject to adjustment. If a make-whole fundamental change\u201d occurs on or before August 15, 2021, then we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.\nThe Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after August 15, 2021, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nIf a fundamental change\u201d occurs prior to the stated maturity date, then noteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nThe Notes are governed by an indenture (the Indenture\u201d) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon dated August 11, 2016. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default with respect to the Notes. If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice to the Company. If an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or a significant subsidiary (as set forth in the Indenture) occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum IP obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>There were no amounts drawn on our $55.0 million revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents aggregate principle amount outstanding of 4.125% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2036.

Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reviewed our policies and determined that those policies remain our critical accounting policies as of and for December 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue in our direct markets is generated by making our products available to hospitals that purchase specific products for use in surgery on a case-by-case basis. Revenue from sales generated by use of products is recognized upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of a surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors who then resell the products to their hospital customers, we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to the international distributors, who accept title at point of shipment.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory\nWe state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using a weighted-average cost method. The majority of our inventory is finished goods, because we utilize third-party suppliers to source most of our products. We evaluate the carrying value of our inventory in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life\ncycle of product releases. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand, which could lead to additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of obsolescence. We maintain numerous different products in our inventory portfolio. Each product system is designed to include implantable parts that come in different sizes and shapes to accommodate a surgeon's needs in the operating theater. A product set is the specific configuration of implants, disposables and instrumentation provided for use in a surgical procedure. Typically a small number of a set's components are used in each surgical procedure and, therefore, certain components within the set may become obsolete before other components based on usage patterns. Our excess and obsolete reserves reflect the usage patterns of the components within each product set.\nIn addition, we continue to introduce new products and product innovations, which we believe will increase our revenue and enhance our relationships with surgeons and hospitals. As a result, we may be required to take charges for excess and/or obsolete inventory, which may have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory and other inventory reserves which are included in cost of revenue, totaled $4.4 million, $5.6 million and $1.7 million in December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our 2010 purchase by WCAS. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. Under recent guidance, prior to performing the annual two-step goodwill impairment test, a company is first permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the two-step quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then it is required to perform a two-step quantitative test. Otherwise, the two-step test is not required. In the first step of the quantitative test, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using an income and discounted cash flow approach.\nThe impairment evaluation related to goodwill requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine discounted future cash flows including estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows, cost of capital and growth rates. Cash flow assumptions used in the assessment are estimated using assumptions in our annual operating budget, as well as our long-term strategic plan. Our budget and strategic plan contain revenue assumptions that are based on existing product technologies, new technologies that are in the process of being developed along with their expected launch dates and life cycle expectations. In addition, management considers relevant market information, peer company data and historical financial information.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In the second step of the impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we must recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nOur evaluation of goodwill completed in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 resulted in no impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated period of benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from four to seven years. Intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged. In these instances, we would evaluate whether a reserve is necessary. If we determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We monitor our tax positions, tax assets and liabilities regularly. We reevaluate the technical positions of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (1) a tax audit is completed, (2) applicable tax law, including tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (3) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nFrom time-to-time we award forms of stock-based compensation to our executives, employees, board of directors and other non-employees that provide us services. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of such awards as of their grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. Awards issued to non-employees (excluding non-employee directors) are recorded at fair value and remeasured periodically as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and recognized as expense over respective service periods.\nCalculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without performance vesting requirements and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d). The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Because we have been a public company for a limited time and have a limited operating history, we utilize the historical stock price volatility from a representative group of public companies, including our own to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected companies from the medical device industry, specifically those who are focused on the design, development and commercialization of products for the treatment of spine disorders, including those who have similar characteristics to us, such as stage of life cycle and size. We expect to continue to utilize a combination of historical volatility of the representative group along with K2M experienced volatility until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the price of our publicly traded stock becomes available.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. We utilize a dividend yield of zero because we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free rate of return used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) awarded is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We account for forfeitures and stock-based awards as they occur.\nStock-based compensation expense totaled $5.9 million, $7.0 million and $11.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $4.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.86 years, and $4.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense underlying option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.98 years.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2017 and accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet effective.\nDeformity Business Seasonality and Other Quarterly Fluctuations in Revenue\nOur revenue is typically higher in the late Spring and Summer and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, driven by higher sales of our complex spine products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of adolescent surgeries during these periods to coincide with the beginning of summer vacation and holiday periods. In addition, our international revenue fluctuates quarterly based on the timing of product registrations, expansion to new markets and product orders from our exclusive international distribution partners.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 1A - Risk Factors; Item 6 - Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Part I - Forward Looking Statements. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per procedure as compared to other spine surgery procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and commercialization of an expanding number of proprietary minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We have also leveraged these core competencies in the design, development and commercialization of an increasing number of products for patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.\nWe categorize our revenue in the United States among revenue generated from the treatment of complex spine pathologies, treatment using MIS approaches and the treatment of degenerative spinal conditions. We define our complex spine procedures as those that involve the treatment of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity, trauma and tumor. We consider MIS procedures to be degenerative procedures done through minimally invasive approaches designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We categorize degenerative procedures as those involving traditional non-MIS products treating degenerative spinal conditions such as traditional spinal fusions and certain single-use MIS products which are sold in support of degenerative surgical procedures. We report revenue related to the sale of biomaterials as part of our complex spine, MIS and degenerative spine revenue categories. We expect our revenue to continue to be driven by aggregate sales growth in all categories. Our revenue classifications may evolve as we grow our business, continue to commercialize new products, adapt to surgeon preferences and surgical techniques and expand our sales globally.\nThe primary market for our products has been the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico, where we sell our products through a hybrid sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies. As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. sales force consisted of 117 direct sales employees and 109 independent sales agencies, who distribute our products and are compensated through a combination of base salaries, individual and company-based performance bonuses, commissions and equity awards. We do not sell our products through or participate in PODs.\nWe also market and sell our products internationally in 40 countries. We sell our products directly in certain markets such as the United Kingdom and Germany, use independent sales agencies in Italy and Canada and through independent distributors in other markets such as Australia, Japan and Spain. For 2017, international sales accounted for approximately 23.5% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2017, our international sales force consisted of 41 direct sales employees, 10 independent sales agencies and 25 independent distributors. Our independent distributors manage the billing relationship with each hospital in their respective territories and are responsible for servicing the product needs of their surgeon customers. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence through the expansion of our distribution network and the commercialization of additional products or product line extensions. In 2017, revenue denominated in currencies other than in U.S. Dollars from our international direct markets represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nRevenue\nWe market and sell spinal implants, disposables and instruments, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat patients with spinal pathologies. In the United States and the international markets where we have direct employee sales locations,\nwhich include the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we manage and maintain the sales relationships with our hospital customers. In those international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we do not manage or maintain the sales relationships with the hospital customers. We do, however, support our distributor partners by providing product training, medical education and engineering expertise to surgeons practicing in these markets.\nIn markets where we have a direct presence, we generally assign our surgical sets to our direct sales employees. A surgical set typically contains the instruments, including any disposables, and spinal implants necessary to complete a successful surgery. With our support, the direct sales employee maintains the surgical sets and places them with our hospital customers for use by surgeons. We recognize revenue upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of the surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we generally sell our surgical sets and the related spinal implant replenishments to our distributors on pre-agreed business terms. We recognize revenue when the title to the goods and the risk of loss related to those goods are transferred to the distributor, typically at the time of shipment from our operations center. All such sales to distributors are not subject to contingencies and are, therefore, final. International revenue was 23.5%, 23.5% and 28.1% of total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe generated 56.2%, 55.6% and 56.0% of our U.S. revenue from the sale of our complex spine and MIS products for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that these core product categories will continue to be significant contributors to our revenue growth in the future.\nWhile we believe the proportion of our international revenue from complex spine and MIS is higher than in the United States, a significant portion of our international revenue is derived from our distributor partners who do not report their product usage at the surgeon or hospital level, which prevents us from providing a specific breakdown for our international revenue among our three product categories.\nCost of Revenue\nExcept for certain specialty products that we manufacture in-house, our instruments, spinal implants and related offerings are manufactured to our specifications by third-party suppliers who meet our manufacturer qualification standards. Our third-party manufacturers meet FDA, ISO and other country-specific quality standards supported by our internal specifications and procedures. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, amortization of surgical instruments, inventory reserves, royalties, inbound shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Cost of revenue also includes related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute terms due primarily to increased sales volume and changes in the geographic mix of our sales as our international operations tend to have a higher cost of revenue as a percentage of sales.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of research and development, engineering, product development, clinical expenses, regulatory expenses, related consulting services, third-party prototyping services, outside research activities, materials production and other costs associated with the design and development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect to incur additional costs as we continue to design and commercialize new products. While our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of specific research, development and testing initiatives, we generally expect these costs will increase in absolute terms over time as we continue to expand our product portfolio and add related personnel.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of commissions to our independent distributors, as well as compensation, commissions, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel employed in our sales, marketing and clinical sales support departments. Sales and marketing also includes the costs of medical education, training, sales related shipping and corporate communications activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute terms due to increased sales volume, the continued expansion of our sales force and the continued commercialization of new products.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in our executive management, finance, regulatory, IT, legal and human resource departments, as well as facility costs and costs associated with consulting and other finance, legal, IT and human resource services provided by third parties. We include legal and litigation expenses as well as costs related to the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio in general and administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel to support the growth of our business. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of no longer being an emerging growth company\u201d. General and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate and/or generate revenue. The effective income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) was enacted, impacting taxpayers in the United States. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. As a result of this change, our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported at December 31, 2017 using the newly enacted federal corporate rate. As a result, we reported a $1.4 million income tax benefit in 2017.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nThe global spinal surgery industry has been growing as a result of:\n \u2022 the increased accessibility of healthcare to more people worldwide; \n \u2022 advances in technologies for treating conditions of the spine, which have increased the addressable market of patients; and \n \u2022 overall population growth, aging patient demographics and an increase in life expectancies around the world.  Nonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties, as further discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry, including:\n \u2022 ongoing requirements from our hospital partners related to pricing and operating procedures; \n \u2022 changes in macroeconomic conditions, catastrophes or other disruptions or conditions influencing patients to delay elective surgeries; \n \u2022 continued market acceptance of our new product innovations; \n \u2022 the unpredictability of government regulation over healthcare and reimbursement in the United States and worldwide; \n \u2022 competitive threats in the future displacing current surgical treatment protocols; \n \u2022 the impact of industry consolidation on the overall market; \n \u2022 the unpredictability of foreign currency exchange rates and the exchange impact on independent distributors outside the United States who pay for our products in U.S. dollars; \n \u2022 competitive threats to our existing distribution and surgeon network; \n \u2022 dependence on our network of direct sales employees, independent sales agencies and international distributors to maintain and expand the level of sales or distribution activity with respect to our products; and \n \u2022 adverse effects and potential risks associated with the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, such as greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexity. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table

The increases in the United States were offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our existing customer base.\nU.S. Revenue\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our U.S. revenue by product category expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and percentages.\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Complex spine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimally invasive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Degenerative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total U.S. revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. revenue increased $16.2 million, or 9.0% to $197.3 million for 2017 from $181.1 million for 2016. Sales in our complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 39.3%, 16.9% and 43.9% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2017 compared to 39.7%, 15.9% and 44.4% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2016. The overall U.S. revenue growth was driven by increased revenue from new surgeon users of $16.7 million and existing surgeons upgrading to our newest product offerings of $8.4 million. The complex spine category growth of $5.6 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $6.7 million and increased usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $1.4 million. The MIS category growth of $4.5 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST minimally invasive products of $2.5 million and increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $3.9 million. The degenerative category growth of $6.1 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $6.4 million and increased surgeon usage of our biomaterials portfolio of $2.1 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue increased $5.2 million, or 9.3%, to $60.7 million for 2017 from $55.6 million for 2016. International revenue increased primarily as a result of increased surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Denmark, as well as increased surgical volumes in Germany and Italy, partially offset by a reduction in surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Spain, India, and lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $6.5 million, or 7.9%, to $88.6 million for 2017 from $82.2 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, to $14.1 million for 2017 from $13.7 million in 2016. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments. The cost of revenue associated with the medical device excise tax in the United States was approximately $0.0 million and $(0.9) million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of recoveries of excise tax overpayments recognized in 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to 65.6% for 2017, from 65.3% for 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to lower inventory reserve allowances.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3.2%, to $22.2 million for 2017 from $21.5 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $12.0 million, or 10.8%, to $123.4 million for 2017 from $111.4 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased travel expense, and higher shipping expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, or 1.7%, to $57.2 million for 2017 from $56.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased spending on outside services and fees, including third-party legal fees and accounting compliance fees. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $6.8 million and $10.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, decreased $1.7 million, or 24.7% to $(5.2) million of expense for 2017 from $(6.9) million for 2016. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.3 million in unrealized gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $2.5 million as a result of a full year's interest expense impact on our convertible senior notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit increased $1.5 million in 2017 to $1.4 million. The increase in the income tax benefit is attributable to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 as a result of lower federal corporate tax rates in the United States which were enacted in December 2017 following passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 3.8% for 2017, as compared to (0.2)% for 2016.\nNet Loss\nNet loss decreased $4.6 million, or 10.8%, to $37.1 million for 2017 from $41.7 million for 2016. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to lower intangible amortization expense and gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,160\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $20.6 million, or 9.5%, to $236.6 million for 2016 from $216.0 million for 2015.

The degenerative category growth of $12.2 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $8.8 million and increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $3.5 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue decreased $5.1 million, or (8.5)%, to $55.6 million for 2016 from $60.7 million for 2015. International revenue decreased primarily as a result of reduced surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Saudi Arabia, lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom, and a temporary suspension of our distributor partner in Japan's import registration.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $10.4 million, or 14.5%, to $82.2 million for 2016 from $71.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume and higher inventory reserve allowance. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $1.4 million, or 11.3%, to $13.7 million for 2016 from $12.3 million in 2015. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to higher inventory reserve allowances and decreased capitalization of overhead costs to inventory.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.6 million, or 8.5%, to $21.5 million for 2016 from $19.9 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline and higher payroll expenses, including stock based compensation.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $5.8 million, or 5.4%, to $111.4 million for 2016 from $105.6 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased employee compensation costs, including stock based compensation from our hiring of direct sales employees since December 31, 2015, and increased shipping expenses as a result of higher surgical volume.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million, or 2.3%, to $56.3 million for 2016 from $55.0 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to employee compensation and benefit costs associated with the increase in personnel to support the expansion of our business, amortization of the compensation cost of restricted stock units issuances, and increases in amortization expense associated with our building under capital lease, partially offset by decreased third-party legal expenses. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $10.4 million and $10.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, increased $4.1 million to $(6.9) million of expense for 2016 from $(2.8) million for 2015. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $3.5 million as a result of our capital lease obligation and a $0.6 million increase in unrealized losses from foreign currency translation on intercompany payable balances.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.1 million to $0.1 million of expense for 2016. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income tax expense was (0.2)% for 2016, from (0.5)% for 2015.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $2.5 million, or 6.2%, to $41.7 million for 2016 from $39.2 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses attributable to greater sales activity.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction (gain) loss.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of our operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,474\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(740\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(142\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception in 2004, we have incurred significant operating losses and anticipate that our losses will continue in the near term. We expect our operating expenses will continue to grow as we expand our product portfolio and penetrate further into existing markets and enter new markets. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability as we grow our business. Prior to our IPO in May 2014, we had funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred and common stock, notes to stockholders, a revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations.\nOn August 11, 2016, we completed the issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% of convertible senior notes due 2036 for which we received net proceeds of approximately $47.1 million. With a portion of these proceeds, we retired all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility of $19.5 million. The remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. For further details regarding the convertible senior notes, please refer to Indebtedness\u201d below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $24.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 of $45.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit\nfacility and had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $99.6 million, compared to $115.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur principal long-term liquidity need is working capital to support the continued growth of our business through the hiring of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies to expand our global sales force, purchases of additional inventory to support future sales activities and the development and commercialization of new products through our research and development efforts. We expect to fund our long-term capital needs with the proceeds from our stock offerings, convertible senior note issuances, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations. We expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility during the first half of 2018. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through incurring additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds.\nAlthough we believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our long-term capital needs, our liquidity and our ability to fund these needs will depend to a significant extent on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control as discussed in Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements will be our ability to provide attractive products to our customers, changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and changes in the regulatory environment. If these factors change significantly or other unexpected factors adversely affect us, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future financings may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all to meet our liquidity needs.\nIn assessing our liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash-on-hand, the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding, payment terms that we have established with our vendors, sales trends, inventory turns, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditure commitments and income tax rates.\nWe are actively exploring acquisition, investment or strategic partnership opportunities to further enhance our product portfolio or development pipeline for future products. We expect these opportunities may result in additional expense or an increase in intellectual property assets when any such agreements are completed or over the period of development of such technologies. In some cases, the development period of the technologies and related expense may extend multiple years in advance of revenue generation. For instance, in October 2017, we acquired and began to market the PALO ALTO Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System from Cardinal Spine, a privately-held medical device company, for an upfront payment, additional milestone payments should the related milestone conditions be met and a royalty on the net sales of products incorporating certain of the intellectual property acquired.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(18,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,547\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $0.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017 from $13.3 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a smaller increase in accounts receivable compared to the increase in accounts receivable in the preceding year as a result of the timing of collections from customers in-part offset\nby the increase in inventory balances compared to the preceding year and higher balances of accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $5.0 million to $13.3 million for 2016 from $18.3 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and a smaller increase in inventory than in the preceding year, partially offset by the increase in trade accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue and the timing of customer collections.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $6.5 million to $17.9 million for 2017 from $24.4 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment incurred in 2016 related to the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. This decrease in cash outflows in 2017 was offset by an increase in purchases of surgical instruments and intangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.1 million to $24.4 million for 2016 from $14.3 million for 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment that were placed in service in connection with the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and increased purchases of surgical instruments.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $40.7 million to $8.4 million for 2017 from $49.1 million for 2016. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included principal payments under our capital lease obligation for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and proceeds we received from the exercise of stock-based awards issued mainly to our employees. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to 2016 events that did not occur in 2017. During 2016, we received net proceeds of $47.1 million from our convertible senior notes issuances which did not recur in 2017, partially offset by increases in exercises of benefit plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $7.1 million to $49.1 million for 2016 from $56.2 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of lower proceeds raised in financing events in 2016. During 2016, we issued our convertible senior notes for which we received net proceeds of $47.1 million Notes issuance compared to proceeds from issuances of our common stock of $54.2 million in 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures were $15.0 million, $29.7 million and $13.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisting primarily of purchases of consigned instrumentation to support surgical sales and expansion of our global distribution network, and software and equipment expenditures to support logistics and administration functions. In 2016, we also incurred capital expenditures of approximately $8.9 million net of changes in restricted cash related to the build-out of tenant improvements and purchases of equipment for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. We expect to purchase additional surgical instruments and continue to expand our global distribution network in 2018. We expect to fund our long-term liquidity needs with cash and cash equivalents, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations.\nIndebtedness\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a senior secured credit facilities credit agreement (as amended from time to time) with Silicon Valley Bank and Comerica Bank as Lenders, which is secured primarily by the assets of our operating subsidiaries in the United States and United Kingdom. The credit facility, as amended, consists of a revolving credit facility of $55.0 million with a sub-facility for letters of credit in the aggregate availability amount of $10.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $5.0 million. The credit facility expires on April 26, 2019.\nAlternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to ABR, plus 0.75%. LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) LIBOR, plus 3.0%. The total obligations under the amended credit facility cannot exceed the lesser of (i) the total revolving commitment of $55.0 million or (ii) the borrowing base, which is calculated as (x) 85% of accounts receivable so long as certain of those accounts receivable do not exceed, in the aggregate, 50% of the borrowing base plus (y) 50% of the value of the eligible inventory provided that the contribution of the value of the eligible inventory not exceed the lesser of 40% of the borrowing\nbase or $15.0 million plus (z) up to $7.5 million to the extent the Borrower and its subsidiaries maintain at least $12.5 million on deposit with a lender or an affiliate of a lender. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility remain secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Borrower's personal property assets, including intellectual property.\nThe revolving credit facility contains various financial covenants and negative covenants with which the Company must maintain compliance, including a consolidated adjusted quick ratio for K2M, Inc., K2M UK Limited and select subsidiaries not less than 1.20:1.00 as of the last day of any month, restrictive covenants which limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock and make certain investments, and the provision of certain financial reporting and company information as required. We were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants of the credit facility at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn August 11, 2016, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2036 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes pay interest at an annual rate of 4.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2017, and mature on August 15, 2036, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us. We received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of approximately $47.1 million and used a portion of such proceeds to repay approximately $19.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nNoteholders may convert their Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock; (4) if we call the Notes for redemption and (5) at any time from, and including, February 15, 2036 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 45.7603 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $21.85 per share, and is subject to adjustment. If a make-whole fundamental change\u201d occurs on or before August 15, 2021, then we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.\nThe Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after August 15, 2021, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nIf a fundamental change\u201d occurs prior to the stated maturity date, then noteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nThe Notes are governed by an indenture (the Indenture\u201d) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon dated August 11, 2016. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default with respect to the Notes. If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice to the Company. If an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or a significant subsidiary (as set forth in the Indenture) occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>< 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum IP obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) There were no amounts drawn on our $55.0 million revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. \n (2) Represents aggregate principle amount outstanding of 4.125% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2036. Such convertible senior notes may be redeemed or converted into shares of K2M common under certain circumstances at Maturity or earlier under certain circumstances as described in Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (3) The above table does not include certain contractual obligations payable in connection with various intellectual property agreements, including (1) contingent obligations payable upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones and (2) royalties payable on net sales of products developed from the applicable intellectual property. However, the table includes all contractual obligations payable in connection with such intellectual property agreements that are fixed and determinable and not subject to cancellation provisions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an undrawn letter of credit and a bank guarantee totaling $6.2 million primarily representing a security deposit on our corporate headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reviewed our policies and determined that those policies remain our critical accounting policies as of and for December 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue in our direct markets is generated by making our products available to hospitals that purchase specific products for use in surgery on a case-by-case basis. Revenue from sales generated by use of products is recognized upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of a surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors who then resell the products to their hospital customers, we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to the international distributors, who accept title at point of shipment.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory\nWe state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using a weighted-average cost method. The majority of our inventory is finished goods, because we utilize third-party suppliers to source most of our products. We evaluate the carrying value of our inventory in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life\ncycle of product releases. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand, which could lead to additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of obsolescence. We maintain numerous different products in our inventory portfolio. Each product system is designed to include implantable parts that come in different sizes and shapes to accommodate a surgeon's needs in the operating theater. A product set is the specific configuration of implants, disposables and instrumentation provided for use in a surgical procedure. Typically a small number of a set's components are used in each surgical procedure and, therefore, certain components within the set may become obsolete before other components based on usage patterns. Our excess and obsolete reserves reflect the usage patterns of the components within each product set.\nIn addition, we continue to introduce new products and product innovations, which we believe will increase our revenue and enhance our relationships with surgeons and hospitals. As a result, we may be required to take charges for excess and/or obsolete inventory, which may have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory and other inventory reserves which are included in cost of revenue, totaled $4.4 million, $5.6 million and $1.7 million in December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our 2010 purchase by WCAS. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. Under recent guidance, prior to performing the annual two-step goodwill impairment test, a company is first permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the two-step quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then it is required to perform a two-step quantitative test. Otherwise, the two-step test is not required. In the first step of the quantitative test, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using an income and discounted cash flow approach.\nThe impairment evaluation related to goodwill requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine discounted future cash flows including estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows, cost of capital and growth rates. Cash flow assumptions used in the assessment are estimated using assumptions in our annual operating budget, as well as our long-term strategic plan. Our budget and strategic plan contain revenue assumptions that are based on existing product technologies, new technologies that are in the process of being developed along with their expected launch dates and life cycle expectations. In addition, management considers relevant market information, peer company data and historical financial information.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In the second step of the impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we must recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nOur evaluation of goodwill completed in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 resulted in no impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated period of benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from four to seven years. Intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged. In these instances, we would evaluate whether a reserve is necessary. If we determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We monitor our tax positions, tax assets and liabilities regularly. We reevaluate the technical positions of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (1) a tax audit is completed, (2) applicable tax law, including tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (3) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nFrom time-to-time we award forms of stock-based compensation to our executives, employees, board of directors and other non-employees that provide us services. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of such awards as of their grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. Awards issued to non-employees (excluding non-employee directors) are recorded at fair value and remeasured periodically as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and recognized as expense over respective service periods.\nCalculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without performance vesting requirements and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d). The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Because we have been a public company for a limited time and have a limited operating history, we utilize the historical stock price volatility from a representative group of public companies, including our own to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected companies from the medical device industry, specifically those who are focused on the design, development and commercialization of products for the treatment of spine disorders, including those who have similar characteristics to us, such as stage of life cycle and size. We expect to continue to utilize a combination of historical volatility of the representative group along with K2M experienced volatility until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the price of our publicly traded stock becomes available.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. We utilize a dividend yield of zero because we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free rate of return used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) awarded is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We account for forfeitures and stock-based awards as they occur.\nStock-based compensation expense totaled $5.9 million, $7.0 million and $11.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $4.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.86 years, and $4.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense underlying option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.98 years.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2017 and accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet effective.\nDeformity Business Seasonality and Other Quarterly Fluctuations in Revenue\nOur revenue is typically higher in the late Spring and Summer and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, driven by higher sales of our complex spine products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of adolescent surgeries during these periods to coincide with the beginning of summer vacation and holiday periods. In addition, our international revenue fluctuates quarterly based on the timing of product registrations, expansion to new markets and product orders from our exclusive international distribution partners.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Item 1A - Risk Factors; Item 6 - Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Part I - Forward Looking Statements. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal years, which end on December 31. Certain amounts and percentages in this discussion and analysis have been rounded for convenience of presentation.\nOverview\nWe are a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity (primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more revenue per procedure as compared to other spine surgery procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and commercialization of an expanding number of proprietary minimally invasive surgery ( MIS\u201d) products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We have also leveraged these core competencies in the design, development and commercialization of an increasing number of products for patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.\nWe categorize our revenue in the United States among revenue generated from the treatment of complex spine pathologies, treatment using MIS approaches and the treatment of degenerative spinal conditions. We define our complex spine procedures as those that involve the treatment of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as deformity, trauma and tumor. We consider MIS procedures to be degenerative procedures done through minimally invasive approaches designed to allow for less invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to traditional open access surgical approaches. We categorize degenerative procedures as those involving traditional non-MIS products treating degenerative spinal conditions such as traditional spinal fusions and certain single-use MIS products which are sold in support of degenerative surgical procedures. We report revenue related to the sale of biomaterials as part of our complex spine, MIS and degenerative spine revenue categories. We expect our revenue to continue to be driven by aggregate sales growth in all categories. Our revenue classifications may evolve as we grow our business, continue to commercialize new products, adapt to surgeon preferences and surgical techniques and expand our sales globally.\nThe primary market for our products has been the United States, including the territory of Puerto Rico, where we sell our products through a hybrid sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies. As of December 31, 2017, our U.S. sales force consisted of 117 direct sales employees and 109 independent sales agencies, who distribute our products and are compensated through a combination of base salaries, individual and company-based performance bonuses, commissions and equity awards. We do not sell our products through or participate in PODs.\nWe also market and sell our products internationally in 40 countries. We sell our products directly in certain markets such as the United Kingdom and Germany, use independent sales agencies in Italy and Canada and through independent distributors in other markets such as Australia, Japan and Spain. For 2017, international sales accounted for approximately 23.5% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2017, our international sales force consisted of 41 direct sales employees, 10 independent sales agencies and 25 independent distributors. Our independent distributors manage the billing relationship with each hospital in their respective territories and are responsible for servicing the product needs of their surgeon customers. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence through the expansion of our distribution network and the commercialization of additional products or product line extensions. In 2017, revenue denominated in currencies other than in U.S. Dollars from our international direct markets represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nWe manage our business globally within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews our business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.\nRevenue\nWe market and sell spinal implants, disposables and instruments, primarily to hospitals, for use by surgeons to treat patients with spinal pathologies. In the United States and the international markets where we have direct employee sales locations,\nwhich include the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we manage and maintain the sales relationships with our hospital customers. In those international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we do not manage or maintain the sales relationships with the hospital customers. We do, however, support our distributor partners by providing product training, medical education and engineering expertise to surgeons practicing in these markets.\nIn markets where we have a direct presence, we generally assign our surgical sets to our direct sales employees. A surgical set typically contains the instruments, including any disposables, and spinal implants necessary to complete a successful surgery. With our support, the direct sales employee maintains the surgical sets and places them with our hospital customers for use by surgeons. We recognize revenue upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of the surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors, we generally sell our surgical sets and the related spinal implant replenishments to our distributors on pre-agreed business terms. We recognize revenue when the title to the goods and the risk of loss related to those goods are transferred to the distributor, typically at the time of shipment from our operations center. All such sales to distributors are not subject to contingencies and are, therefore, final. International revenue was 23.5%, 23.5% and 28.1% of total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe generated 56.2%, 55.6% and 56.0% of our U.S. revenue from the sale of our complex spine and MIS products for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that these core product categories will continue to be significant contributors to our revenue growth in the future.\nWhile we believe the proportion of our international revenue from complex spine and MIS is higher than in the United States, a significant portion of our international revenue is derived from our distributor partners who do not report their product usage at the surgeon or hospital level, which prevents us from providing a specific breakdown for our international revenue among our three product categories.\nCost of Revenue\nExcept for certain specialty products that we manufacture in-house, our instruments, spinal implants and related offerings are manufactured to our specifications by third-party suppliers who meet our manufacturer qualification standards. Our third-party manufacturers meet FDA, ISO and other country-specific quality standards supported by our internal specifications and procedures. Substantially all of our suppliers manufacture our products in the United States. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, amortization of surgical instruments, inventory reserves, royalties, inbound shipping, inspection and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Cost of revenue also includes related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute terms due primarily to increased sales volume and changes in the geographic mix of our sales as our international operations tend to have a higher cost of revenue as a percentage of sales.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of research and development, engineering, product development, clinical expenses, regulatory expenses, related consulting services, third-party prototyping services, outside research activities, materials production and other costs associated with the design and development of our products. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants' compensation and stock-based compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect to incur additional costs as we continue to design and commercialize new products. While our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of specific research, development and testing initiatives, we generally expect these costs will increase in absolute terms over time as we continue to expand our product portfolio and add related personnel.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of commissions to our independent distributors, as well as compensation, commissions, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel employed in our sales, marketing and clinical sales support departments. Sales and marketing also includes the costs of medical education, training, sales related shipping and corporate communications activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute terms due to increased sales volume, the continued expansion of our sales force and the continued commercialization of new products.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel employed in our executive management, finance, regulatory, IT, legal and human resource departments, as well as facility costs and costs associated with consulting and other finance, legal, IT and human resource services provided by third parties. We include legal and litigation expenses as well as costs related to the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio in general and administrative expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel to support the growth of our business. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of no longer being an emerging growth company\u201d. General and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe are taxed at the rates applicable within each jurisdiction in which we operate and/or generate revenue. The effective income tax rate, tax provisions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the respective governmental taxing authorities, and require us to exercise judgment in determining our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) was enacted, impacting taxpayers in the United States. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. As a result of this change, our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported at December 31, 2017 using the newly enacted federal corporate rate. As a result, we reported a $1.4 million income tax benefit in 2017.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nThe global spinal surgery industry has been growing as a result of:\n \u2022 the increased accessibility of healthcare to more people worldwide; \n \u2022 advances in technologies for treating conditions of the spine, which have increased the addressable market of patients; and \n \u2022 overall population growth, aging patient demographics and an increase in life expectancies around the world.  Nonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties, as further discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry, including:\n \u2022 ongoing requirements from our hospital partners related to pricing and operating procedures; \n \u2022 changes in macroeconomic conditions, catastrophes or other disruptions or conditions influencing patients to delay elective surgeries; \n \u2022 continued market acceptance of our new product innovations; \n \u2022 the unpredictability of government regulation over healthcare and reimbursement in the United States and worldwide; \n \u2022 competitive threats in the future displacing current surgical treatment protocols; \n \u2022 the impact of industry consolidation on the overall market; \n \u2022 the unpredictability of foreign currency exchange rates and the exchange impact on independent distributors outside the United States who pay for our products in U.S. dollars; \n \u2022 competitive threats to our existing distribution and surgeon network; \n \u2022 dependence on our network of direct sales employees, independent sales agencies and international distributors to maintain and expand the level of sales or distribution activity with respect to our products; and \n \u2022 adverse effects and potential risks associated with the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, such as greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and European Union countries and increased regulatory complexity. \nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts: \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\n\nTotal revenue increased $21.4 million, or 9.0% to $258.0 million for 2017 from $236.6 million for 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by $16.7 million in greater sales volume from new surgeon users in the United States and a $8.4 million increase as surgeons upgraded to our newest product offerings in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in revenue in certain international markets, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, and India. The increases in the United States were offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our existing customer base.\nU.S. Revenue\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our U.S. revenue by product category expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and percentages.\n\nU.S. revenue increased $16.2 million, or 9.0% to $197.3 million for 2017 from $181.1 million for 2016. Sales in our complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 39.3%, 16.9% and 43.9% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2017 compared to 39.7%, 15.9% and 44.4% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2016. The overall U.S. revenue growth was driven by increased revenue from new surgeon users of $16.7 million and existing surgeons upgrading to our newest product offerings of $8.4 million. The complex spine category growth of $5.6 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $6.7 million and increased usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $1.4 million. The MIS category growth of $4.5 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST minimally invasive products of $2.5 million and increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $3.9 million. The degenerative category growth of $6.1 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $6.4 million and increased surgeon usage of our biomaterials portfolio of $2.1 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue increased $5.2 million, or 9.3%, to $60.7 million for 2017 from $55.6 million for 2016. International revenue increased primarily as a result of increased surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Denmark, as well as increased surgical volumes in Germany and Italy, partially offset by a reduction in surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Spain, India, and lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $6.5 million, or 7.9%, to $88.6 million for 2017 from $82.2 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, to $14.1 million for 2017 from $13.7 million in 2016. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments. The cost of revenue associated with the medical device excise tax in the United States was approximately $0.0 million and $(0.9) million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of recoveries of excise tax overpayments recognized in 2016.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased as a percentage of revenue to 65.6% for 2017, from 65.3% for 2016. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to lower inventory reserve allowances.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3.2%, to $22.2 million for 2017 from $21.5 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $12.0 million, or 10.8%, to $123.4 million for 2017 from $111.4 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased travel expense, and higher shipping expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million, or 1.7%, to $57.2 million for 2017 from $56.3 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased spending on outside services and fees, including third-party legal fees and accounting compliance fees. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $6.8 million and $10.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, decreased $1.7 million, or 24.7% to $(5.2) million of expense for 2017 from $(6.9) million for 2016. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily attributable to an increase of $4.3 million in unrealized gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $2.5 million as a result of a full year's interest expense impact on our convertible senior notes, which were issued in August 2016.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit increased $1.5 million in 2017 to $1.4 million. The increase in the income tax benefit is attributable to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 as a result of lower federal corporate tax rates in the United States which were enacted in December 2017 following passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 3.8% for 2017, as compared to (0.2)% for 2016.\nNet Loss\nNet loss decreased $4.6 million, or 10.8%, to $37.1 million for 2017 from $41.7 million for 2016. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to lower intangible amortization expense and gains from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue by geography expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages:\n\nTotal revenue increased $20.6 million, or 9.5%, to $236.6 million for 2016 from $216.0 million for 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by $16.7 million in greater sales volume from new surgeon users in the United States and a $14.1 million increase as surgeons upgraded to our newest product offerings in the United States, partially offset by a reduction in revenue in our international markets, primarily in Australia, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia and Japan. The increases in the United States were offset in part by a decrease in revenue from our existing customer base.\nU.S. Revenue\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our U.S. revenue by product category expressed as dollar amounts and the changes in such revenue between the specified periods expressed in dollar amounts and percentages:\n\nU.S. revenue increased $25.8 million or 16.6%, to $181.1 million for 2016 from $155.3 million for 2015. Sales in our complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 39.7%, 15.9% and 44.4% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2016, compared to 40.8%, 15.2% and 44.0% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for 2015. The overall U.S. revenue growth was driven by increased revenue from new surgeon users of $16.7 million and existing surgeons upgrading to our newest product offerings of $14.1 million. The complex spine category growth of $8.5 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems\nof $6.1 million, increased usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $1.5 million, and increased usage of our CAPRI thoraco-lumbar corpectomy device of $0.8 million. The MIS category growth of $5.1 million reflects increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST minimally invasive products of $3.7 million and increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $3.4 million. The degenerative category growth of $12.2 million primarily reflects increased surgeon usage of our CASCADIA interbody devices of $8.8 million and increased surgeon usage of our EVEREST systems of $3.5 million.\nInternational Revenue\nInternational revenue decreased $5.1 million, or (8.5)%, to $55.6 million for 2016 from $60.7 million for 2015. International revenue decreased primarily as a result of reduced surgical set investments by our distributor partners in Australia and Saudi Arabia, lower surgical volumes in the United Kingdom, and a temporary suspension of our distributor partner in Japan's import registration.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased $10.4 million, or 14.5%, to $82.2 million for 2016 from $71.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume and higher inventory reserve allowance. In addition, surgical instrument amortization expense, increased $1.4 million, or 11.3%, to $13.7 million for 2016 from $12.3 million in 2015. The increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of increased investment in surgical instruments. The cost of revenue associated with the medical device excise tax in the United States was approximately $(0.9) million and $0.5 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of recoveries of excise tax overpayments.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased as a percentage of revenue to 65.3% for 2016 from 66.8% for 2015. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to higher inventory reserve allowances and decreased capitalization of overhead costs to inventory.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $1.6 million, or 8.5%, to $21.5 million for 2016 from $19.9 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased development activities related to products in our pipeline and higher payroll expenses, including stock based compensation.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $5.8 million, or 5.4%, to $111.4 million for 2016 from $105.6 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of higher sales volume, increased employee compensation costs, including stock based compensation from our hiring of direct sales employees since December 31, 2015, and increased shipping expenses as a result of higher surgical volume.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.3 million, or 2.3%, to $56.3 million for 2016 from $55.0 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to employee compensation and benefit costs associated with the increase in personnel to support the expansion of our business, amortization of the compensation cost of restricted stock units issuances, and increases in amortization expense associated with our building under capital lease, partially offset by decreased third-party legal expenses. General and administrative expenses includes amortization of intangible assets of $10.4 million and $10.3 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, increased $4.1 million to $(6.9) million of expense for 2016 from $(2.8) million for 2015. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $3.5 million as a result of our capital lease obligation and a $0.6 million increase in unrealized losses from foreign currency translation on intercompany payable balances.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $0.1 million to $0.1 million of expense for 2016. Our effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of loss before income tax expense was (0.2)% for 2016, from (0.5)% for 2015.\nNet Loss\nNet loss increased $2.5 million, or 6.2%, to $41.7 million for 2016 from $39.2 million for 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses attributable to greater sales activity.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction (gain) loss.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of our operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception in 2004, we have incurred significant operating losses and anticipate that our losses will continue in the near term. We expect our operating expenses will continue to grow as we expand our product portfolio and penetrate further into existing markets and enter new markets. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability as we grow our business. Prior to our IPO in May 2014, we had funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of preferred and common stock, notes to stockholders, a revolving credit facility and cash flow from operations.\nOn August 11, 2016, we completed the issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% of convertible senior notes due 2036 for which we received net proceeds of approximately $47.1 million. With a portion of these proceeds, we retired all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility of $19.5 million. The remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. For further details regarding the convertible senior notes, please refer to Indebtedness\u201d below.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $24.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 of $45.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit\nfacility and had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $99.6 million, compared to $115.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur principal long-term liquidity need is working capital to support the continued growth of our business through the hiring of direct sales employees and independent sales agencies to expand our global sales force, purchases of additional inventory to support future sales activities and the development and commercialization of new products through our research and development efforts. We expect to fund our long-term capital needs with the proceeds from our stock offerings, convertible senior note issuances, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations. We expect to borrow on our revolving credit facility during the first half of 2018. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through incurring additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds.\nAlthough we believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our long-term capital needs, our liquidity and our ability to fund these needs will depend to a significant extent on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control as discussed in Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements will be our ability to provide attractive products to our customers, changes in our customers' ability to obtain third-party coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use our products, increased pricing pressures resulting from intensifying competition, cost increases and changes in the regulatory environment. If these factors change significantly or other unexpected factors adversely affect us, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future financings may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all to meet our liquidity needs.\nIn assessing our liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash-on-hand, the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding, payment terms that we have established with our vendors, sales trends, inventory turns, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditure commitments and income tax rates.\nWe are actively exploring acquisition, investment or strategic partnership opportunities to further enhance our product portfolio or development pipeline for future products. We expect these opportunities may result in additional expense or an increase in intellectual property assets when any such agreements are completed or over the period of development of such technologies. In some cases, the development period of the technologies and related expense may extend multiple years in advance of revenue generation. For instance, in October 2017, we acquired and began to market the PALO ALTO Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System from Cardinal Spine, a privately-held medical device company, for an upfront payment, additional milestone payments should the related milestone conditions be met and a royalty on the net sales of products incorporating certain of the intellectual property acquired.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nCash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $0.5 million to $12.8 million for 2017 from $13.3 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a smaller increase in accounts receivable compared to the increase in accounts receivable in the preceding year as a result of the timing of collections from customers in-part offset\nby the increase in inventory balances compared to the preceding year and higher balances of accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased $5.0 million to $13.3 million for 2016 from $18.3 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and a smaller increase in inventory than in the preceding year, partially offset by the increase in trade accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue and the timing of customer collections.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $6.5 million to $17.9 million for 2017 from $24.4 million for 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment incurred in 2016 related to the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. This decrease in cash outflows in 2017 was offset by an increase in purchases of surgical instruments and intangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.1 million to $24.4 million for 2016 from $14.3 million for 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to leasehold build-out costs and investments in furniture and equipment that were placed in service in connection with the transition to our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and increased purchases of surgical instruments.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $40.7 million to $8.4 million for 2017 from $49.1 million for 2016. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included principal payments under our capital lease obligation for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities and proceeds we received from the exercise of stock-based awards issued mainly to our employees. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to 2016 events that did not occur in 2017. During 2016, we received net proceeds of $47.1 million from our convertible senior notes issuances which did not recur in 2017, partially offset by increases in exercises of benefit plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $7.1 million to $49.1 million for 2016 from $56.2 million for 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of lower proceeds raised in financing events in 2016. During 2016, we issued our convertible senior notes for which we received net proceeds of $47.1 million Notes issuance compared to proceeds from issuances of our common stock of $54.2 million in 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures were $15.0 million, $29.7 million and $13.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consisting primarily of purchases of consigned instrumentation to support surgical sales and expansion of our global distribution network, and software and equipment expenditures to support logistics and administration functions. In 2016, we also incurred capital expenditures of approximately $8.9 million net of changes in restricted cash related to the build-out of tenant improvements and purchases of equipment for our corporate headquarters and operations facilities, which did not recur in 2017. We expect to purchase additional surgical instruments and continue to expand our global distribution network in 2018. We expect to fund our long-term liquidity needs with cash and cash equivalents, availability under our revolving credit facility (which may vary due to changes in our borrowing base) and cash flow from operations.\nIndebtedness\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a senior secured credit facilities credit agreement (as amended from time to time) with Silicon Valley Bank and Comerica Bank as Lenders, which is secured primarily by the assets of our operating subsidiaries in the United States and United Kingdom. The credit facility, as amended, consists of a revolving credit facility of $55.0 million with a sub-facility for letters of credit in the aggregate availability amount of $10.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $5.0 million. The credit facility expires on April 26, 2019.\nAlternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to ABR, plus 0.75%. LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) LIBOR, plus 3.0%. The total obligations under the amended credit facility cannot exceed the lesser of (i) the total revolving commitment of $55.0 million or (ii) the borrowing base, which is calculated as (x) 85% of accounts receivable so long as certain of those accounts receivable do not exceed, in the aggregate, 50% of the borrowing base plus (y) 50% of the value of the eligible inventory provided that the contribution of the value of the eligible inventory not exceed the lesser of 40% of the borrowing\nbase or $15.0 million plus (z) up to $7.5 million to the extent the Borrower and its subsidiaries maintain at least $12.5 million on deposit with a lender or an affiliate of a lender. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility remain secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Borrower's personal property assets, including intellectual property.\nThe revolving credit facility contains various financial covenants and negative covenants with which the Company must maintain compliance, including a consolidated adjusted quick ratio for K2M, Inc., K2M UK Limited and select subsidiaries not less than 1.20:1.00 as of the last day of any month, restrictive covenants which limit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common stock and make certain investments, and the provision of certain financial reporting and company information as required. We were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants of the credit facility at December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $49.0 million of unused borrowing capacity, which is net of an issued but undrawn letter of credit for $6.0 million representing a security deposit on the new headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn August 11, 2016, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2036 (the Notes\u201d). The Notes pay interest at an annual rate of 4.125%, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2017, and mature on August 15, 2036, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us. We received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of approximately $47.1 million and used a portion of such proceeds to repay approximately $19.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nNoteholders may convert their Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price on such trading day; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock; (4) if we call the Notes for redemption and (5) at any time from, and including, February 15, 2036 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 45.7603 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $21.85 per share, and is subject to adjustment. If a make-whole fundamental change\u201d occurs on or before August 15, 2021, then we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.\nThe Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after August 15, 2021, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nIf a fundamental change\u201d occurs prior to the stated maturity date, then noteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nThe Notes are governed by an indenture (the Indenture\u201d) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon dated August 11, 2016. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default with respect to the Notes. If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice to the Company. If an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or a significant subsidiary (as set forth in the Indenture) occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) There were no amounts drawn on our $55.0 million revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. \n (2) Represents aggregate principle amount outstanding of 4.125% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2036. Such convertible senior notes may be redeemed or converted into shares of K2M common under certain circumstances at Maturity or earlier under certain circumstances as described in Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (3) The above table does not include certain contractual obligations payable in connection with various intellectual property agreements, including (1) contingent obligations payable upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones and (2) royalties payable on net sales of products developed from the applicable intellectual property. However, the table includes all contractual obligations payable in connection with such intellectual property agreements that are fixed and determinable and not subject to cancellation provisions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an undrawn letter of credit and a bank guarantee totaling $6.2 million primarily representing a security deposit on our corporate headquarters and operations facilities lease.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We use historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as they occur.\nManagement believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reviewed our policies and determined that those policies remain our critical accounting policies as of and for December 31, 2017.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nRevenue in our direct markets is generated by making our products available to hospitals that purchase specific products for use in surgery on a case-by-case basis. Revenue from sales generated by use of products is recognized upon receipt of a delivered order confirming that our products have been used in a surgical procedure or following shipment and transfer of title to a hospital that purchases products in advance of a surgery.\nIn our international markets where we utilize independent distributors who then resell the products to their hospital customers, we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to the international distributors, who accept title at point of shipment.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory\nWe state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using a weighted-average cost method. The majority of our inventory is finished goods, because we utilize third-party suppliers to source most of our products. We evaluate the carrying value of our inventory in relation to the estimated forecast of product demand, which takes into consideration the estimated life\ncycle of product releases. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand, which could lead to additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.\nThe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory impacts the risk of obsolescence. We maintain numerous different products in our inventory portfolio. Each product system is designed to include implantable parts that come in different sizes and shapes to accommodate a surgeon's needs in the operating theater. A product set is the specific configuration of implants, disposables and instrumentation provided for use in a surgical procedure. Typically a small number of a set's components are used in each surgical procedure and, therefore, certain components within the set may become obsolete before other components based on usage patterns. Our excess and obsolete reserves reflect the usage patterns of the components within each product set.\nIn addition, we continue to introduce new products and product innovations, which we believe will increase our revenue and enhance our relationships with surgeons and hospitals. As a result, we may be required to take charges for excess and/or obsolete inventory, which may have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations. Charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory and other inventory reserves which are included in cost of revenue, totaled $4.4 million, $5.6 million and $1.7 million in December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our 2010 purchase by WCAS. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. Under recent guidance, prior to performing the annual two-step goodwill impairment test, a company is first permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the two-step quantitative test must be completed. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and specific reporting unit specifications. If after performing this assessment, we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then it is required to perform a two-step quantitative test. Otherwise, the two-step test is not required. In the first step of the quantitative test, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. Fair value of the reporting unit is determined using an income and discounted cash flow approach.\nThe impairment evaluation related to goodwill requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine discounted future cash flows including estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows, cost of capital and growth rates. Cash flow assumptions used in the assessment are estimated using assumptions in our annual operating budget, as well as our long-term strategic plan. Our budget and strategic plan contain revenue assumptions that are based on existing product technologies, new technologies that are in the process of being developed along with their expected launch dates and life cycle expectations. In addition, management considers relevant market information, peer company data and historical financial information.\nIf the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In the second step of the impairment test, we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we must recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill.\nOur evaluation of goodwill completed in each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 resulted in no impairment losses.\nIntangible assets are amortized over their estimated period of benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from four to seven years. Intangible assets are also reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWhile we believe that our tax positions are fully supportable, there is a risk that certain positions could be challenged. In these instances, we would evaluate whether a reserve is necessary. If we determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We monitor our tax positions, tax assets and liabilities regularly. We reevaluate the technical positions of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when (1) a tax audit is completed, (2) applicable tax law, including tax case or legislative guidance, changes or (3) the statute of limitations expires. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nFrom time-to-time we award forms of stock-based compensation to our executives, employees, board of directors and other non-employees that provide us services. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of such awards as of their grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. Awards issued to non-employees (excluding non-employee directors) are recorded at fair value and remeasured periodically as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, and recognized as expense over respective service periods.\nCalculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards without performance vesting requirements and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d). The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Because we have been a public company for a limited time and have a limited operating history, we utilize the historical stock price volatility from a representative group of public companies, including our own to estimate expected stock price volatility. We selected companies from the medical device industry, specifically those who are focused on the design, development and commercialization of products for the treatment of spine disorders, including those who have similar characteristics to us, such as stage of life cycle and size. We expect to continue to utilize a combination of historical volatility of the representative group along with K2M experienced volatility until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the price of our publicly traded stock becomes available.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. We utilize a dividend yield of zero because we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free rate of return used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) awarded is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We account for forfeitures and stock-based awards as they occur.\nStock-based compensation expense totaled $5.9 million, $7.0 million and $11.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $4.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.86 years, and $4.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense underlying option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.98 years.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2017 and accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet effective.\nDeformity Business Seasonality and Other Quarterly Fluctuations in Revenue\nOur revenue is typically higher in the late Spring and Summer and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, driven by higher sales of our complex spine products, which is influenced by the higher incidence of adolescent surgeries during these periods to coincide with the beginning of summer vacation and holiday periods. In addition, our international revenue fluctuates quarterly based on the timing of product registrations, expansion to new markets and product orders from our exclusive international distribution
