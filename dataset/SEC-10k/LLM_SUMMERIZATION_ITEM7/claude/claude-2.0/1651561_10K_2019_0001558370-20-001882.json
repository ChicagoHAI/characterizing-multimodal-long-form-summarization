Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in providing medication safety technology and services that enable prescribers and pharmacists to engage patients, optimize medication regimens, improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and lower healthcare costs. We deliver our solutions through technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management, which includes bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services for certain client populations with complex prescription needs. Many of our products and services are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, which enables optimization of a patient's medication regimen, personalized medication selection, dosage levels, and time-of-day administration, and reduction of the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions. We believe we offer the first prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, which is designed to increase patient safety and promote adherence to a patient's personalized medication regimen.\nOur cloud-based software applications are designed to assist prescribers and pharmacists with patient engagement, identification of high risk patients, clinical decision support, documentation of clinical interactions, ordering medications and lab tests, and care management.\nOur personalized medication risk management services can be based on our MRM Matrix technology. For each patient, the personalized MRM Matrix incorporates personal medical history data inputs, summarizes the aggregate risk of the medications the patient is taking based on proprietary algorithms and provides clinical alerts, including for the risk of cognitive impairment, sedation, and an unintentional overdose. This MRM Matrix can be utilized by prescribers independently or analyzed by our pharmacists, to optimize each patient's medication regimen.\nAt the end of 2017 we were serving 170 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. At the end of 2018 we were serving 224 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. As of December 31, 2019, this number had grown to 237 healthcare organizations and over 16,900 pharmacies. The increase in the number of pharmacies in 2019 was primarily due to the PrescribeWellness acquisition.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $284.7 million, $204.3 million, and $133.5 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, incurred a net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and generated a net income of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $37.9 million compared to $29.3 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 204,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 80,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 204,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 133,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 70,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,060)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nnm = not meaningful\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate and client retention rate described as follows.\nRevenue retention rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate at the end of each calendar year by dividing total revenue in the year from client contracts that have not been renewed or have been terminated during the year by our total revenue for that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual revenue retention rate was 98%, 99%, and 99% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nClient retention rate\nWe monitor our client retention rate as a measure for our overall business performance. We believe that our ability to retain clients is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our client retention rate. We calculate this rate by dividing the number of client terminations and client non-renewals during a calendar year by the total number of clients serviced during that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual client retention rate was 91%, 96%, and 95% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decline in client retention is the direct result of including the PrescribeWellness customer base in our calculation. While PrescribeWellness has a higher churn than the rest of our business, due to the nature of the contracts, it is low compared to many SaaS businesses.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn March 5, 2019, we entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired PrescribeWellness, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, or PrescribeWellness. PrescribeWellness is a leading cloud-based patient engagement solutions company that facilitates collaboration between more than 12,000 pharmacies with patients, payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies. We paid $150 million in cash consideration, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. A portion of the consideration is being held in escrow to secure potential claims for indemnification under the Merger Agreement and in respect of adjustments to the consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nOn January 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of the outstanding share capital and options to purchase share capital of DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd, or DoseMe, a proprietary company limited by shares organized under the Laws of Australia. DoseMe is the developer of DoseMeRx, an advanced precision dosing tool to help physicians and pharmacists more accurately dose patients' high-risk parenteral medications. The acquisition was made pursuant to a Share Purchase Deed made and entered into as of November 30, 2018. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, (ii) the issuance of 149,053 shares of our common stock, and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration. The stock consideration issued upon closing had an acquisition-date fair value of $9.5 million. During the third quarter of 2019, we elected to accelerate the payment of the contingent earn out payment and paid $8.8 million in full satisfaction of the contingent purchase price consideration.\nOn October 19, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cognify, Inc., a California corporation, or Cognify, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Cognify is a leading electronic health records solutions and services provider in the PACE market and to managed long-term care and medical home providers. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.8 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 93,579 shares of our common stock; and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock based on the financial results of the acquired business and certain other factors set forth in the purchase agreement. The stock consideration issued upon closing had an acquisition-date fair value of $7.5 million. We are not obligated to pay more than $14.0 million in cash and our common stock for the contingent payment.\nOn August 31, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with each member of Mediture LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, and eClusive L.L.C., a Minnesota limited liability company, collectively Mediture, pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership and economic interests of Mediture. Mediture is a provider of electronic health record solutions and third party administrator services in the PACE market and also services several managed long-term care organizations in the State of New York. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $18.5 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and (ii) the issuance of 45,561 shares of our common stock. The stock consideration issued at the closing of the acquisition had an acquisition-date fair value of $4.0 million.\nOn May 1, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Peak PACE Solutions, LLC, or Peak PACE, and certain other parties thereto pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the assets, and assumed certain enumerated liabilities, of Peak PACE, an organization that helps PACE organizations manage the business functions that drive the major sources of reimbursement revenue and utilization costs. The acquisition consideration was comprised of cash consideration consisting of (i) $7.7 million payable upon the closing of the acquisition, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments and (ii) contingent purchase price to be paid in cash based on the achievement of certain performance goals for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018. We made the final cash payment of $1.6 million in full satisfaction of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration payable during the second quarter of 2019.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. The notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 14.2966 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $69.95 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof at our option. In connection with the offering of the notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, or the option counterparties, of the notes pursuant to the terms of call option confirmations. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management and development of our business, and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc. (which had previously changed its legal name to TRHC OpCo, Inc., or TRHC OpCo, on December 20, 2019), and as a result thereof, following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC OpCo which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC and the three DoseMe foreign subsidiaries.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, product sales represented 48%, 55%, and 71% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, service revenue represented 52%, 45%, and 29% of our total revenue, respectively.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to PACE organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nService Revenue\nService revenue consists of MRM services, health plan management services, and pharmacy cost management services.\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these\ncontracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug utilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of prescription medications under our medication risk management offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the prescription medications we dispense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 prescription medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred for the prescription medications we dispense, other costs include expenses to package, dispense and distribute prescription medications, expenses associated with our prescription fulfillment centers, including employment costs and stock-based compensation, and expenses related to the hosting of our technology platform. Such costs also include direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to our MRM services which primarily consist of labor costs, outside contractors, and expenses related to supporting our technology platforms. In addition, cost of service revenue includes all labor costs, including stock-based compensation expense, directly related to the health plan management and pharmacy cost management services and expenses for claims processing, technology services and overhead costs. Cost of service revenue also includes direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions, which include software developers, project managers and other employees engaged in scientific education and research, and the development and enhancement of our service offerings. Research and development expenses also include costs for design and development of new scientific algorithms, software and technology and new service offerings, as well as enhancement of existing software and technology and service offerings, including fees paid to third-party consultants, costs related to quality assurance and testing, and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing proprietary software platforms, which are used to support our service contracts, including direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing and client service activities. Marketing costs also include costs of communication and branding materials, trade shows and public relations, as well as allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our marketing operations and expand into new products and markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. We expect to hire additional sales personnel and related account management and sales support personnel as we continue to grow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies. These increases have included and will likely continue to include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for directors, outside consultants, accountants, lawyers and investor relations. We also expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nRemeasurement of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We will continue to adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment and our capitalized software development and acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, our revolving credit facility, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to these various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

to $137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $3.2 million to the increase. Increased prescription fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients represented approximately $17.1 million of the increase, and medication mix of prescriptions filled and payer mix contributed to an additional $4.0 million of the overall increase in product revenue.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased $56.1 million, or 61%, from $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $42.0 million to the increase. Each acquisition experienced growth from the revenue run-rates recognized at the closing dates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, MRM service revenue grew approximately $8.7 million, primarily related to the expansion of existing customer relationships. Health plan management services increased $3.1 million primarily as a result of growth in our risk adjustment services. In addition, pharmacy cost management services increased $2.3 million related to more favorable revenues on the sale of medication utilization data.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $17.4 million, or 21%, from $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $102.3 million for the comparable period in 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $2.2 million to the increase. In addition, increased prescription volume as a result of growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers contributed approximately $10.4 million to the change. Manufacturer price increases and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients' patients contributed an additional $1.2 million to the overall increase in the cost of product revenue. In addition, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, increased $1.9 million due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance based increases. Distribution charges represented $1.6 million of the increase and related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled for our clients' patients.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $26.3 million, or 50%, from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed approximately $16.9 million to the increase in service costs. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, MRM service costs increased approximately $7.4 million, of which $5.3 million was primarily due to increases in headcount and related employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, to support the growth of our MTM service offerings. MRM service costs also increased due to a $1.6 million increase in contract labor costs, as well as increases in information technology expenses. Service costs related to our health plan management services, excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, increased $2.7 million primarily as a result of an increase in employee compensation costs to support the growth in the risk adjustment operations of our health plan management services. These increases in service cost were offset by a decrease in our pharmacy cost management due to lower claim submission activity.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $9.5 million, or 78%, from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $1.6 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in research and development costs was largely due to an increase in employee compensation costs of approximately $6.4 million, of which $4.8 million related to increased stock compensation costs related to grants made during 2019 as well as performance-based equity awards granted in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining increase in employee compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Research and development expenses were also impacted by a $761 thousand increase in contractor costs and a $399 thousand increase in rent expense due to the expanded office space for our healthcare analytics and software development departments at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to increases in information technology spending and travel costs to support development efforts.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $15.6 million, or 161%, from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.0 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in personnel costs, which included an increase in stock compensation expenses of $2.5 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, additional headcount to support the expansion of our sales team, and increases in salaries and benefits related to market adjustments and performance-based increases for our existing employees. The remaining increases in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $568 thousand increase in conference and other travel costs related to business development activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $22.7 million, or 81%, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.2 million to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding the acquisitions, higher employee compensation costs of $8.5 million were primarily due to an increase in stock compensation of $5.4 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, an increase in headcount to support the overall growth of our operations, and increases in salaries and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Professional service fees primarily related to audit, tax and internal control services and legal fees represented $1.9 million of the increase. In addition, general and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million as a result of acquisition related transaction costs related to the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness in 2019. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased information technology expenses due to operational growth.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a $3.8 million and $49.5 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent consideration is based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the Cognify contingent consideration liability was $10.8 million with the potential for up to an additional $3.2 million to be earned if the maximum contingent amount is earned, which would flow through as a charge to net income or loss. The final amount of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration liability will be fixed as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $300 thousand for the change in the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a charge of $30 thousand related to the fair value adjustment of the final DoseMe acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. We elected to accelerate the payment of the DoseMe contingent consideration and made a final cash payment during the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $624 thousand charge related to the fair value adjustments of the final SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $49.9 million charge related to the fair value adjustments of the SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. The SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liability was paid in full during the first quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $163 thousand remeasurement charge related to the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration as a result of final purchase price adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $141 thousand to the fair value of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration related to fair value adjustments. The Peak PACE liability was paid in full during the second quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the final payment related to the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of Medliance LLC, or Medliance, was paid in full. During 2018, we incurred $6 thousand related to the accretion of the final Medliance contingent consideration amount.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $17.5 million, or 104%, from $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to $14.7 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness in 2018 and 2019. The increase in amortization expense was also due to a $2.0 million\nincrease in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2018, of which Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness accounted for $509 thousand of the increase. Depreciation expense also increased by $916 thousand, which primarily related to property and equipment acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.1 million from $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to $15.6 million of interest expense on the 2026 Notes, which were issued in February 2019, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit and a decrease in interest expense on finance leases.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $16.2 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.3%. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.4 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.7%. The benefit was primarily from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by a tax expense generated from the fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 2018 and 2017\nFor a discussion of results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, please refer to Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus certain other expenses, which includes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense (income), severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>to prepare and approve our annual budget; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>to develop short- and long-term operational plans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net (loss) income for the periods presented:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,791\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 688\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,199)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,376)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,339)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,512\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense (income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,173)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 921\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,847\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 17,247\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry and to be more consistent with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net (loss) income before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018 and the tax impact of those items, as well as adjustments for tax benefits related to the partial release of our valuation allowance and recognition of windfall benefits, expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted

Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, debt service obligations and strategic business acquisitions. We have funded our operations, working capital needs and investments with cash generated through operations, issuance of stock and borrowings under our credit facilities.

The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized software development costs and acquisition-related intangibles, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to equity awards granted to employees and non-employees in 2018 and 2019, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to our pharmacy cost management business, health plan management contracts and MRM service contracts, and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liability related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock granted to certain employees and stock options granted to employees in 2018, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the SRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MRM services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted primarily of our net income of $12.8 million plus the addition of noncash items of $2.7 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $2.8 million. The noncash items primarily included depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles of $9.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.8 million, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock that were granted to certain employees in 2016 and stock options granted to employees, which were partially offset by non-cash income from the change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $6.2 million and a $9.5 million deferred tax benefit primarily due to the release of a significant portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognition of an additional benefit related to tax windfall benefits generated during the year ended December 31, 2017. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits accruals as of December 31, 2017, and an increase in accounts payable as of December 31, 2017. The increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to new revenues generated from our MRM service contracts during 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of equipment and improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MRM services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs related to costs associated with internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for SRx and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MRM service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and reflected $34.5 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisition of SRx. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $3.3 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to our office space and headquarters in Moorestown, New Jersey, our new space in South Carolina dedicated to software development, and new space in South San Francisco, California dedicated to pharmacy dispensing, which we began to occupy in February 2017. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.3 million in software development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the SRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted of $34.9 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting costs, from our common stock offering, which was partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees from shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2017. Net cash used in financing activities also included a $1.5 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition and $600 thousand of payments related to our acquisition related consideration for 9176-1916 Quebec Inc., $959 thousand in payments for the repurchase of common stock, and $766 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nFunding Requirements\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering and the remaining net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, fund the final payments related to the Peak PACE and SRx acquisition-relation contingent consideration liabilities, fund the PrescribeWellness acquisition in March 2019 and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we have $59.8 million available for borrowings under our Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants related to the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit as of December 31, 2019. See Note 12 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes and the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $42.5 million as of December 31, 2019, borrowing capacity under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2021. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,228\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letter of credit (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 369,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 337,428\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Contingent consideration represents the estimated future cash payments as of December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018.

The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2020.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation instruments, (vi) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (viii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-classified conversion option. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services. We use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to healthcare organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments\nService Revenue\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these contracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug\nutilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were and, with respect to certain acquisitions, are contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities are recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the probability of meeting the future events; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test. If this is the case, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. If the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, first, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.\nFactors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are currently realizable, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of new accounting standards. We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases, as of January 1, 2019.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in providing medication safety technology and services that enable prescribers and pharmacists to engage patients, optimize medication regimens, improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and lower healthcare costs. We deliver our solutions through technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management, which includes bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services for certain client populations with complex prescription needs. Many of our products and services are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, which enables optimization of a patient's medication regimen, personalized medication selection, dosage levels, and time-of-day administration, and reduction of the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions. We believe we offer the first prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, which is designed to increase patient safety and promote adherence to a patient's personalized medication regimen.\nOur cloud-based software applications are designed to assist prescribers and pharmacists with patient engagement, identification of high risk patients, clinical decision support, documentation of clinical interactions, ordering medications and lab tests, and care management.\nOur personalized medication risk management services can be based on our MRM Matrix technology. For each patient, the personalized MRM Matrix incorporates personal medical history data inputs, summarizes the aggregate risk of the medications the patient is taking based on proprietary algorithms and provides clinical alerts, including for the risk of cognitive impairment, sedation, and an unintentional overdose. This MRM Matrix can be utilized by prescribers independently or analyzed by our pharmacists, to optimize each patient's medication regimen.\nAt the end of 2017 we were serving 170 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. At the end of 2018 we were serving 224 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. As of December 31, 2019, this number had grown to 237 healthcare organizations and over 16,900 pharmacies. The increase in the number of pharmacies in 2019 was primarily due to the PrescribeWellness acquisition.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $284.7 million, $204.3 million, and $133.5 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, incurred a net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and generated a net income of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $37.9 million compared to $29.3 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 284,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 204,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 80,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 204,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 133,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 70,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,060)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nnm = not meaningful\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate and client retention rate described as follows.\nRevenue retention rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate at the end of each calendar year by dividing total revenue in the year from client contracts that have not been renewed or have been terminated during the year by our total revenue for that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual revenue retention rate was 98%, 99%, and 99% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nClient retention rate\nWe monitor our client retention rate as a measure for our overall business performance. We believe that our ability to retain clients is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our client retention rate. We calculate this rate by dividing the number of client terminations and client non-renewals during a calendar year by the total number of clients serviced during that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual client retention rate was 91%, 96%, and 95% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decline in client retention is the direct result of including the PrescribeWellness customer base in our calculation. While PrescribeWellness has a higher churn than the rest of our business, due to the nature of the contracts, it is low compared to many SaaS businesses.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn March 5, 2019, we entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired PrescribeWellness, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, or PrescribeWellness. PrescribeWellness is a leading cloud-based patient engagement solutions company that facilitates collaboration between more than 12,000 pharmacies with patients, payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies. We paid $150 million in cash consideration, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement. A portion of the consideration is being held in escrow to secure potential claims for indemnification under the Merger Agreement and in respect of adjustments to the consideration under the Merger Agreement.\nOn January 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of the outstanding share capital and options to purchase share capital of DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd, or DoseMe, a proprietary company limited by shares organized under the Laws of Australia. DoseMe is the developer of DoseMeRx, an advanced precision dosing tool to help physicians and pharmacists more accurately dose patients' high-risk parenteral medications. The acquisition was made pursuant to a Share Purchase Deed made and entered into as of November 30, 2018. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, (ii) the issuance of 149,053 shares of our common stock, and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration. The stock consideration issued upon closing had an acquisition-date fair value of $9.5 million. During the third quarter of 2019, we elected to accelerate the payment of the contingent earn out payment and paid $8.8 million in full satisfaction of the contingent purchase price consideration.\nOn October 19, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cognify, Inc., a California corporation, or Cognify, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Cognify is a leading electronic health records solutions and services provider in the PACE market and to managed long-term care and medical home providers. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.8 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 93,579 shares of our common stock; and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock based on the financial results of the acquired business and certain other factors set forth in the purchase agreement. The stock consideration issued upon closing had an acquisition-date fair value of $7.5 million. We are not obligated to pay more than $14.0 million in cash and our common stock for the contingent payment.\nOn August 31, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with each member of Mediture LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, and eClusive L.L.C., a Minnesota limited liability company, collectively Mediture, pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership and economic interests of Mediture. Mediture is a provider of electronic health record solutions and third party administrator services in the PACE market and also services several managed long-term care organizations in the State of New York. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $18.5 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and (ii) the issuance of 45,561 shares of our common stock. The stock consideration issued at the closing of the acquisition had an acquisition-date fair value of $4.0 million.\nOn May 1, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Peak PACE Solutions, LLC, or Peak PACE, and certain other parties thereto pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the assets, and assumed certain enumerated liabilities, of Peak PACE, an organization that helps PACE organizations manage the business functions that drive the major sources of reimbursement revenue and utilization costs. The acquisition consideration was comprised of cash consideration consisting of (i) $7.7 million payable upon the closing of the acquisition, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments and (ii) contingent purchase price to be paid in cash based on the achievement of certain performance goals for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018. We made the final cash payment of $1.6 million in full satisfaction of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration payable during the second quarter of 2019.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. The notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 14.2966 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $69.95 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof at our option. In connection with the offering of the notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, or the option counterparties, of the notes pursuant to the terms of call option confirmations. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management and development of our business, and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc. (which had previously changed its legal name to TRHC OpCo, Inc., or TRHC OpCo, on December 20, 2019), and as a result thereof, following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC OpCo which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC and the three DoseMe foreign subsidiaries.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, product sales represented 48%, 55%, and 71% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, service revenue represented 52%, 45%, and 29% of our total revenue, respectively.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to PACE organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nService Revenue\nService revenue consists of MRM services, health plan management services, and pharmacy cost management services.\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these\ncontracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug utilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of prescription medications under our medication risk management offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the prescription medications we dispense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 prescription medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred for the prescription medications we dispense, other costs include expenses to package, dispense and distribute prescription medications, expenses associated with our prescription fulfillment centers, including employment costs and stock-based compensation, and expenses related to the hosting of our technology platform. Such costs also include direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to our MRM services which primarily consist of labor costs, outside contractors, and expenses related to supporting our technology platforms. In addition, cost of service revenue includes all labor costs, including stock-based compensation expense, directly related to the health plan management and pharmacy cost management services and expenses for claims processing, technology services and overhead costs. Cost of service revenue also includes direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions, which include software developers, project managers and other employees engaged in scientific education and research, and the development and enhancement of our service offerings. Research and development expenses also include costs for design and development of new scientific algorithms, software and technology and new service offerings, as well as enhancement of existing software and technology and service offerings, including fees paid to third-party consultants, costs related to quality assurance and testing, and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing proprietary software platforms, which are used to support our service contracts, including direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing and client service activities. Marketing costs also include costs of communication and branding materials, trade shows and public relations, as well as allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our marketing operations and expand into new products and markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. We expect to hire additional sales personnel and related account management and sales support personnel as we continue to grow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies. These increases have included and will likely continue to include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for directors, outside consultants, accountants, lawyers and investor relations. We also expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nRemeasurement of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We will continue to adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment and our capitalized software development and acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, our revolving credit facility, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to these various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

to $137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $3.2 million to the increase. Increased prescription fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients represented approximately $17.1 million of the increase, and medication mix of prescriptions filled and payer mix contributed to an additional $4.0 million of the overall increase in product revenue.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased $56.1 million, or 61%, from $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $42.0 million to the increase. Each acquisition experienced growth from the revenue run-rates recognized at the closing dates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, MRM service revenue grew approximately $8.7 million, primarily related to the expansion of existing customer relationships. Health plan management services increased $3.1 million primarily as a result of growth in our risk adjustment services. In addition, pharmacy cost management services increased $2.3 million related to more favorable revenues on the sale of medication utilization data.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $17.4 million, or 21%, from $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $102.3 million for the comparable period in 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $2.2 million to the increase. In addition, increased prescription volume as a result of growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers contributed approximately $10.4 million to the change. Manufacturer price increases and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients' patients contributed an additional $1.2 million to the overall increase in the cost of product revenue. In addition, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, increased $1.9 million due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance based increases. Distribution charges represented $1.6 million of the increase and related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled for our clients' patients.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $26.3 million, or 50%, from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed approximately $16.9 million to the increase in service costs. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, MRM service costs increased approximately $7.4 million, of which $5.3 million was primarily due to increases in headcount and related employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, to support the growth of our MTM service offerings. MRM service costs also increased due to a $1.6 million increase in contract labor costs, as well as increases in information technology expenses. Service costs related to our health plan management services, excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, increased $2.7 million primarily as a result of an increase in employee compensation costs to support the growth in the risk adjustment operations of our health plan management services. These increases in service cost were offset by a decrease in our pharmacy cost management due to lower claim submission activity.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $9.5 million, or 78%, from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $1.6 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in research and development costs was largely due to an increase in employee compensation costs of approximately $6.4 million, of which $4.8 million related to increased stock compensation costs related to grants made during 2019 as well as performance-based equity awards granted in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining increase in employee compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Research and development expenses were also impacted by a $761 thousand increase in contractor costs and a $399 thousand increase in rent expense due to the expanded office space for our healthcare analytics and software development departments at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to increases in information technology spending and travel costs to support development efforts.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $15.6 million, or 161%, from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.0 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in personnel costs, which included an increase in stock compensation expenses of $2.5 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, additional headcount to support the expansion of our sales team, and increases in salaries and benefits related to market adjustments and performance-based increases for our existing employees. The remaining increases in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $568 thousand increase in conference and other travel costs related to business development activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $22.7 million, or 81%, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.2 million to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding the acquisitions, higher employee compensation costs of $8.5 million were primarily due to an increase in stock compensation of $5.4 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, an increase in headcount to support the overall growth of our operations, and increases in salaries and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Professional service fees primarily related to audit, tax and internal control services and legal fees represented $1.9 million of the increase. In addition, general and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million as a result of acquisition related transaction costs related to the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness in 2019. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased information technology expenses due to operational growth.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a $3.8 million and $49.5 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent consideration is based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the Cognify contingent consideration liability was $10.8 million with the potential for up to an additional $3.2 million to be earned if the maximum contingent amount is earned, which would flow through as a charge to net income or loss. The final amount of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration liability will be fixed as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $300 thousand for the change in the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a charge of $30 thousand related to the fair value adjustment of the final DoseMe acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. We elected to accelerate the payment of the DoseMe contingent consideration and made a final cash payment during the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $624 thousand charge related to the fair value adjustments of the final SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $49.9 million charge related to the fair value adjustments of the SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. The SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liability was paid in full during the first quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $163 thousand remeasurement charge related to the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration as a result of final purchase price adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $141 thousand to the fair value of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration related to fair value adjustments. The Peak PACE liability was paid in full during the second quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the final payment related to the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of Medliance LLC, or Medliance, was paid in full. During 2018, we incurred $6 thousand related to the accretion of the final Medliance contingent consideration amount.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $17.5 million, or 104%, from $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to $14.7 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness in 2018 and 2019. The increase in amortization expense was also due to a $2.0 million\nincrease in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2018, of which Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness accounted for $509 thousand of the increase. Depreciation expense also increased by $916 thousand, which primarily related to property and equipment acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.1 million from $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to $15.6 million of interest expense on the 2026 Notes, which were issued in February 2019, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit and a decrease in interest expense on finance leases.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $16.2 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.3%. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.4 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.7%. The benefit was primarily from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by a tax expense generated from the fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 2018 and 2017\nFor a discussion of results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, please refer to Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus certain other expenses, which includes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense (income), severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u25cf as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; \n \u25cf to prepare and approve our annual budget; and \n \u25cf to develop short- and long-term operational plans. \nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\n \u25cf although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; and \n \u25cf other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net (loss) income for the periods presented:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,436)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (47,269)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 12,791\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 688\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,199)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,376)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,339)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,512\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense (income)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,173)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition-related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 921\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,847\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 37,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 29,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 17,247\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry and to be more consistent with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net (loss) income before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018 and the tax impact of those items, as well as adjustments for tax benefits related to the partial release of our valuation allowance and recognition of windfall benefits, expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted

Method as we intend to settle the notes entirely or partly in cash. Under this method, the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, except to the extent that the average stock price for the reporting period exceeds their conversion price of $69.95 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no impact on diluted EPS from the convertible senior subordinated notes as the conversion price exceeded our average stock price. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe incurred a net loss of $32.4 million, net loss of $47.3 million, and generated net income of $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, debt service obligations and strategic business acquisitions. We have funded our operations, working capital needs and investments with cash generated through operations, issuance of stock and borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash of $42.5 million.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (5,815)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,308\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(180,925)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,808)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,068)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,845\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 21,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,085\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $32.4 million, $24.5 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the SRx, Peak PACE and DoseMe acquisitions, changes in net deferred taxes of $16.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $8.8 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $76.3 million. The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized software development costs and acquisition-related intangibles, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to equity awards granted to employees and non-employees in 2018 and 2019, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to our pharmacy cost management business, health plan management contracts and MRM service contracts, and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liability related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock granted to certain employees and stock options granted to employees in 2018, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the SRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MRM services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted primarily of our net income of $12.8 million plus the addition of noncash items of $2.7 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $2.8 million. The noncash items primarily included depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles of $9.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.8 million, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock that were granted to certain employees in 2016 and stock options granted to employees, which were partially offset by non-cash income from the change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $6.2 million and a $9.5 million deferred tax benefit primarily due to the release of a significant portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognition of an additional benefit related to tax windfall benefits generated during the year ended December 31, 2017. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits accruals as of December 31, 2017, and an increase in accounts payable as of December 31, 2017. The increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to new revenues generated from our MRM service contracts during 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of equipment and improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MRM services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs related to costs associated with internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for SRx and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MRM service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and reflected $34.5 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisition of SRx. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $3.3 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to our office space and headquarters in Moorestown, New Jersey, our new space in South Carolina dedicated to software development, and new space in South San Francisco, California dedicated to pharmacy dispensing, which we began to occupy in February 2017. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.3 million in software development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the SRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted of $34.9 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting costs, from our common stock offering, which was partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees from shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2017. Net cash used in financing activities also included a $1.5 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition and $600 thousand of payments related to our acquisition related consideration for 9176-1916 Quebec Inc., $959 thousand in payments for the repurchase of common stock, and $766 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nFunding Requirements\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering and the remaining net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, fund the final payments related to the Peak PACE and SRx acquisition-relation contingent consideration liabilities, fund the PrescribeWellness acquisition in March 2019 and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we have $59.8 million available for borrowings under our Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants related to the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit as of December 31, 2019. See Note 12 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes and the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $42.5 million as of December 31, 2019, borrowing capacity under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2021. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior subordinated notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 325,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration payments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,228\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letter of credit (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 369,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 337,428\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Contingent consideration represents the estimated future cash payments as of December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018.

The letter of credit renews annually and expires in September 2027. \n (5) Effective December 2018, we entered into a vendor agreement with a vendor to provide information technology related services that commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $2.0 million in the first three years of the contract. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.6 million was remaining under the contract. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, we entered into an updated agreement with our data aggregation partner for our pharmacy cost management services, which commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $30 thousand per month for 36 months. \nOur existing office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.\nIn addition, effective March 2019, we entered into an Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc. to provide us with the pharmaceutical products that we sell. The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2020.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation instruments, (vi) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (viii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-classified conversion option. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services. We use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to healthcare organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments\nService Revenue\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these contracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug\nutilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were and, with respect to certain acquisitions, are contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities are recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\n \u25cf future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; \n \u25cf the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; \n \u25cf the probability of meeting the future events; and \n \u25cf discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. \nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test. If this is the case, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. If the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, first, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.\nFactors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets are currently realizable, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of new accounting standards. We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases, as of January 1, 2019.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in providing medication safety technology and services that enable prescribers and pharmacists to engage patients, optimize medication regimens, improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and lower healthcare costs. We deliver our solutions through technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management, which includes bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services for certain client populations with complex prescription needs. Many of our products and services are built around our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, which enables optimization of a patient's medication regimen, personalized medication selection, dosage levels, and time-of-day administration, and reduction of the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions. We believe we offer the first prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, which is designed to increase patient safety and promote adherence to a patient's personalized medication regimen.\nOur cloud-based software applications are designed to assist prescribers and pharmacists with patient engagement, identification of high risk patients, clinical decision support, documentation of clinical interactions, ordering medications and lab tests, and care management.\nOur personalized medication risk management services can be based on our MRM Matrix technology. For each patient, the personalized MRM Matrix incorporates personal medical history data inputs, summarizes the aggregate risk of the medications the patient is taking based on proprietary algorithms and provides clinical alerts, including for the risk of cognitive impairment, sedation, and an unintentional overdose. This MRM Matrix can be utilized by prescribers independently or analyzed by our pharmacists, to optimize each patient's medication regimen.\nAt the end of 2017 we were serving 170 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. At the end of 2018 we were serving 224 healthcare organizations and over 4,600 pharmacies. As of December 31, 2019, this number had grown to 237 healthcare organizations and over 16,900 pharmacies. The increase in the number of pharmacies in 2019 was primarily due to the PrescribeWellness acquisition.\nOur total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $284.7 million, $204.3 million, and $133.5 million, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, incurred a net loss of $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and generated a net income of $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $37.9 million compared to $29.3 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net losses to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe face a variety of challenges and risks, which we will need to address and manage as we pursue our growth strategy. In particular, we will need to continue to innovate in the face of a rapidly changing healthcare landscape if we are to remain competitive. We will also need to effectively manage our growth, especially related to our expansion beyond the PACE and post-acute markets to other at-risk providers and payers. Our senior management continuously focuses on these and other challenges, and we believe that our culture of innovation and our history of growth and expansion will contribute to the success of our business. We cannot, however, assure you that we will be successful in addressing and managing the many challenges and risks that we face.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate and manage our business. These metrics are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry.\n\n\nnm = not meaningful\nWe monitor the key metrics set forth in the preceding table to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and gauge our cash generation. We discuss Adjusted EBITDA in more detail in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA.\" We also monitor revenue retention rate and client retention rate described as follows.\nRevenue retention rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue associated with new or existing client relationships is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value we provide to our clients. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate at the end of each calendar year by dividing total revenue in the year from client contracts that have not been renewed or have been terminated during the year by our total revenue for that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual revenue retention rate was 98%, 99%, and 99% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nClient retention rate\nWe monitor our client retention rate as a measure for our overall business performance. We believe that our ability to retain clients is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our client retention rate. We calculate this rate by dividing the number of client terminations and client non-renewals during a calendar year by the total number of clients serviced during that year, and subtracting this quotient from 100%. Our annual client retention rate was 91%, 96%, and 95% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decline in client retention is the direct result of including the PrescribeWellness customer base in our calculation. While PrescribeWellness has a higher churn than the rest of our business, due to the nature of the contracts, it is low compared to many SaaS businesses.\nFactors Affecting our Future Performance\nWe believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with existing clients, expand our client base, continue to enter new markets and expand our offerings to meet evolving market needs. While these areas present significant opportunities, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may impact our future success.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn March 5, 2019, we entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired PrescribeWellness, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, or PrescribeWellness.

During the third quarter of 2019, we elected to accelerate the payment of the contingent earn out payment and paid $8.8 million in full satisfaction of the contingent purchase price consideration.\nOn October 19, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cognify, Inc., a California corporation, or Cognify, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Cognify is a leading electronic health records solutions and services provider in the PACE market and to managed long-term care and medical home providers. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $10.8 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of 93,579 shares of our common stock; and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock based on the financial results of the acquired business and certain other factors set forth in the purchase agreement. The stock consideration issued upon closing had an acquisition-date fair value of $7.5 million. We are not obligated to pay more than $14.0 million in cash and our common stock for the contingent payment.\nOn August 31, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, TRHC MEC Holdings, LLC, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with each member of Mediture LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, and eClusive L.L.C., a Minnesota limited liability company, collectively Mediture, pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership and economic interests of Mediture. Mediture is a provider of electronic health record solutions and third party administrator services in the PACE market and also services several managed long-term care organizations in the State of New York. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $18.5 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and (ii) the issuance of 45,561 shares of our common stock. The stock consideration issued at the closing of the acquisition had an acquisition-date fair value of $4.0 million.\nOn May 1, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Peak PACE Solutions, LLC, or Peak PACE, and certain other parties thereto pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the assets, and assumed certain enumerated liabilities, of Peak PACE, an organization that helps PACE organizations manage the business functions that drive the major sources of reimbursement revenue and utilization costs. The acquisition consideration was comprised of cash consideration consisting of (i) $7.7 million payable upon the closing of the acquisition, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments and (ii) contingent purchase price to be paid in cash based on the achievement of certain performance goals for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018. We made the final cash payment of $1.6 million in full satisfaction of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration payable during the second quarter of 2019.\nWe account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nFinancing\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. The notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The initial conversion rate for the notes is 14.2966 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. This conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $69.95 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination thereof at our option. In connection with the offering of the notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, or the option counterparties, of the notes pursuant to the terms of call option confirmations. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.\nCorporate Reorganization\nEffective January 1, 2020, in order to facilitate the administration, management and development of our business, and minimize the burden on our tax and regulatory reporting obligations, we implemented a reorganization pursuant to which all of our domestic subsidiaries, other than CK Solutions, LLC, merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary CareKinesis, Inc. (which had previously changed its legal name to TRHC OpCo, Inc., or TRHC OpCo, on December 20, 2019), and as a result thereof, following such reorganization, our only directly owned subsidiary is TRHC OpCo which is the parent of CK Solutions, LLC and the three DoseMe foreign subsidiaries.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from our product sales and service activities. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, product sales represented 48%, 55%, and 71% of our total revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, service revenue represented 52%, 45%, and 29% of our total revenue, respectively.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to PACE organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nService Revenue\nService revenue consists of MRM services, health plan management services, and pharmacy cost management services.\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these\ncontracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug utilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nProduct Cost\nCost of product revenue includes all costs directly related to the fulfillment and distribution of prescription medications under our medication risk management offerings. Costs consist primarily of the purchase price of the prescription medications we dispense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 prescription medication costs represented 79% of our total product costs. In addition to costs incurred for the prescription medications we dispense, other costs include expenses to package, dispense and distribute prescription medications, expenses associated with our prescription fulfillment centers, including employment costs and stock-based compensation, and expenses related to the hosting of our technology platform. Such costs also include direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nService Cost\nCost of service revenue includes all costs directly related to our MRM services which primarily consist of labor costs, outside contractors, and expenses related to supporting our technology platforms. In addition, cost of service revenue includes all labor costs, including stock-based compensation expense, directly related to the health plan management and pharmacy cost management services and expenses for claims processing, technology services and overhead costs. Cost of service revenue also includes direct overhead expenses, as well as allocated miscellaneous overhead costs. We allocate miscellaneous overhead costs among functions based on employee headcount.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel in our research and development functions, which include software developers, project managers and other employees engaged in scientific education and research, and the development and enhancement of our service offerings. Research and development expenses also include costs for design and development of new scientific algorithms, software and technology and new service offerings, as well as enhancement of existing software and technology and service offerings, including fees paid to third-party consultants, costs related to quality assurance and testing, and other allocated facility-related overhead and expenses.\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing proprietary software platforms, which are used to support our service contracts, including direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software development costs are amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our existing suite of software solutions.\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our software solutions and service offerings, but will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as we expect our revenue to increase at a greater rate than such expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits for sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel costs related to sales, marketing and client service activities. Marketing costs also include costs of communication and branding materials, trade shows and public relations, as well as allocated overhead.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we strategically invest to grow our marketing operations and expand into new products and markets, but decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. We expect to hire additional sales personnel and related account management and sales support personnel as we continue to grow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of employee-related expenses, including compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees who are responsible for information systems, administration, human resources, finance, legal and executive management as well as other corporate expenses associated with these functional areas. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our infrastructure and continue to comply with the requirements applicable to public companies. These increases have included and will likely continue to include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for directors, outside consultants, accountants, lawyers and investor relations. We also expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nRemeasurement of Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration\nWe classify our acquisition-related contingent consideration as a liability. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date. Any change in the fair value of such acquisition-related contingent consideration is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the liability. We will continue to adjust the carrying value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration until the contingency is finally determined.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment in equipment and our capitalized software development and acquisition-related intangibles.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, our revolving credit facility, and our finance lease obligations. It also includes the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to these various debt arrangements.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nnm = not meaningful\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased $24.3 million, or 22%, from $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $137.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $3.2 million to the increase. Increased prescription fulfillment volume from growth in the number of patients served by our existing clients represented approximately $17.1 million of the increase, and medication mix of prescriptions filled and payer mix contributed to an additional $4.0 million of the overall increase in product revenue.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased $56.1 million, or 61%, from $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $147.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $42.0 million to the increase. Each acquisition experienced growth from the revenue run-rates recognized at the closing dates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, MRM service revenue grew approximately $8.7 million, primarily related to the expansion of existing customer relationships. Health plan management services increased $3.1 million primarily as a result of growth in our risk adjustment services. In addition, pharmacy cost management services increased $2.3 million related to more favorable revenues on the sale of medication utilization data.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased $17.4 million, or 21%, from $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $102.3 million for the comparable period in 2019. New MRM prescription fulfillment clients acquired period over period contributed $2.2 million to the increase. In addition, increased prescription volume as a result of growth in the number of patients served by our existing customers contributed approximately $10.4 million to the change. Manufacturer price increases and medication mix of prescriptions filled for our clients' patients contributed an additional $1.2 million to the overall increase in the cost of product revenue. In addition, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, increased $1.9 million due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance based increases. Distribution charges represented $1.6 million of the increase and related to higher shipping volume for the medications we fulfilled for our clients' patients.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased $26.3 million, or 50%, from $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recent acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed approximately $16.9 million to the increase in service costs. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, MRM service costs increased approximately $7.4 million, of which $5.3 million was primarily due to increases in headcount and related employee compensation, including stock-based compensation, to support the growth of our MTM service offerings. MRM service costs also increased due to a $1.6 million increase in contract labor costs, as well as increases in information technology expenses. Service costs related to our health plan management services, excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, increased $2.7 million primarily as a result of an increase in employee compensation costs to support the growth in the risk adjustment operations of our health plan management services. These increases in service cost were offset by a decrease in our pharmacy cost management due to lower claim submission activity.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased $9.5 million, or 78%, from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $1.6 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in research and development costs was largely due to an increase in employee compensation costs of approximately $6.4 million, of which $4.8 million related to increased stock compensation costs related to grants made during 2019 as well as performance-based equity awards granted in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining increase in employee compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount as well as increases in salary and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Research and development expenses were also impacted by a $761 thousand increase in contractor costs and a $399 thousand increase in rent expense due to the expanded office space for our healthcare analytics and software development departments at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to increases in information technology spending and travel costs to support development efforts.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $15.6 million, or 161%, from $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.0 million to the increase, which primarily related to employee compensation costs. Excluding the acquisitions, the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in personnel costs, which included an increase in stock compensation expenses of $2.5 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, additional headcount to support the expansion of our sales team, and increases in salaries and benefits related to market adjustments and performance-based increases for our existing employees. The remaining increases in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $568 thousand increase in conference and other travel costs related to business development activities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $22.7 million, or 81%, from $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness contributed $10.2 million to the increase in expenses, which consisted primarily of employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, information technology expenses, business insurance costs, and rent and utilities expenses. Excluding the acquisitions, higher employee compensation costs of $8.5 million were primarily due to an increase in stock compensation of $5.4 million related to equity awards granted during 2019, an increase in headcount to support the overall growth of our operations, and increases in salaries and benefits for existing employees related to market adjustments and performance-based increases. Professional service fees primarily related to audit, tax and internal control services and legal fees represented $1.9 million of the increase. In addition, general and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million as a result of acquisition related transaction costs related to the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness in 2019. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased information technology expenses due to operational growth.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a $3.8 million and $49.5 million charge, respectively, related to the fair value adjustments of our acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $3.0 million charge to increase the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration primarily due to an amendment of certain definitions used in the calculation of the contingent consideration set forth in the stock purchase agreement, and the decreased discount period to the final measurement date. The Cognify contingent consideration is based on a multiple of the excess of Cognify's 2021 revenues and EBITDA over its 2018 revenues and EBITDA, as defined in the stock purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the Cognify contingent consideration liability was $10.8 million with the potential for up to an additional $3.2 million to be earned if the maximum contingent amount is earned, which would flow through as a charge to net income or loss. The final amount of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration liability will be fixed as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $300 thousand for the change in the fair value of the Cognify acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a charge of $30 thousand related to the fair value adjustment of the final DoseMe acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. We elected to accelerate the payment of the DoseMe contingent consideration and made a final cash payment during the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $624 thousand charge related to the fair value adjustments of the final SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration amount. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $49.9 million charge related to the fair value adjustments of the SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. The SRx acquisition-related contingent consideration liability was paid in full during the first quarter of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $163 thousand remeasurement charge related to the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration as a result of final purchase price adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a remeasurement gain of $141 thousand to the fair value of the Peak PACE acquisition-related contingent consideration related to fair value adjustments. The Peak PACE liability was paid in full during the second quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the final payment related to the acquisition-related contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of Medliance LLC, or Medliance, was paid in full. During 2018, we incurred $6 thousand related to the accretion of the final Medliance contingent consideration amount.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $17.5 million, or 104%, from $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to $14.7 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness in 2018 and 2019. The increase in amortization expense was also due to a $2.0 million\nincrease in the amortization of capitalized software related to new software functionality placed into service since 2018, of which Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness accounted for $509 thousand of the increase. Depreciation expense also increased by $916 thousand, which primarily related to property and equipment acquired from Peak PACE, Mediture, Cognify, DoseMe, and PrescribeWellness.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $15.1 million from $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to $15.6 million of interest expense on the 2026 Notes, which were issued in February 2019, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit and a decrease in interest expense on finance leases.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an income tax benefit of $16.2 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.3%. The benefit primarily consists of the benefit generated by the Company's losses, the benefit from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by other tax expense due to the increase in the Company's valuation allowance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.4 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 6.7%. The benefit was primarily from windfall tax benefits generated from the vesting of restricted stock, disqualifying dispositions, and exercising of nonqualified stock options during the period, offset by a tax expense generated from the fair value adjustment of the Company's contingent consideration liabilities.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 2018 and 2017\nFor a discussion of results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, please refer to Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information about our financial results, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus certain other expenses, which includes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income tax, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense (income), severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018, acquisition-related expense and stock-based compensation related expense. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is one of the measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance, and we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance. We believe this metric is commonly used by the financial community, and we present it to enhance investors' understanding of our operating performance and cash flows. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u25cf as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; \n \u25cf to prepare and approve our annual budget; and \n \u25cf to develop short- and long-term operational plans. \nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. As a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. In particular:\n \u25cf although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash interest income or expense; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect severance related payments related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018; and \n \u25cf other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net (loss) income and our other GAAP financial results and not in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. You should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net (loss) income for the periods presented:\n\nAdjusted Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders, or Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAdjusted Diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items and, therefore, has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operations, results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry and to be more consistent with our expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Our management uses this measure along with corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as net (loss) income before fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, acquisition-related expense, stock-based compensation related expense, severance expense related to the termination of two members of senior management in 2018 and the tax impact of those items, as well as adjustments for tax benefits related to the partial release of our valuation allowance and recognition of windfall benefits, expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We consider acquisition-related expense to include nonrecurring direct transaction and integration costs, severance, and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair value of acquired deferred revenue.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation, and we do not intend to imply that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe following table reconciles net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders on a diluted basis, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted Diluted EPS:\n\n (1) The impact to taxes was calculated using a normalized statutory tax rate applied to pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for the respective items above and then subtracting the tax provision as determined for GAAP purposes. \nThe following table reconciles the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate net (loss) income per share on a diluted basis for GAAP purposes to the diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate Adjusted Diluted EPS:\n\n (1) We account for the convertible senior subordinated notes utilizing the Treasury Stock Method as we intend to settle the notes entirely or partly in cash. Under this method, the underlying shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, except to the extent that the average stock price for the reporting period exceeds their conversion price of $69.95 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no impact on diluted EPS from the convertible senior subordinated notes as the conversion price exceeded our average stock price. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe incurred a net loss of $32.4 million, net loss of $47.3 million, and generated net income of $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, debt service obligations and strategic business acquisitions. We have funded our operations, working capital needs and investments with cash generated through operations, issuance of stock and borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash of $42.5 million.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $32.4 million, $24.5 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the SRx, Peak PACE and DoseMe acquisitions, changes in net deferred taxes of $16.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $8.8 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $76.3 million. The noncash items primarily included $34.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized software development costs and acquisition-related intangibles, $27.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to equity awards granted to employees and non-employees in 2018 and 2019, $10.9 million of amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts primarily related to the 2026 Notes, and $3.8 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify, and DoseMe. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to our pharmacy cost management business, health plan management contracts and MRM service contracts, and an increase in prepaid information technology expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was also due to a decrease in accounts payable as a result of shorter payment terms with our new medication vendor, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee compensation, contract liability related to our performance obligations for our services, and interest expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of our net loss of $47.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $10.0 million, offset by the addition of noncash items of $73.1 million. The noncash items primarily included $49.5 million in the aggregate related to the change in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration for SRx, Peak PACE, and Cognify, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles, and $10.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock granted to certain employees and stock options granted to employees in 2018, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit of $3.6 million. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to revenues generated as a result of the SRx, Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify acquisitions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase in contract assets related to estimated drug utilization fees in pharmacy cost management services and a decrease in accounts payable, which were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued contract labor costs to support our MRM services, accrued employee related expenses, and client fund obligations acquired from the Peak PACE and Mediture acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted primarily of our net income of $12.8 million plus the addition of noncash items of $2.7 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities totaling $2.8 million. The noncash items primarily included depreciation and amortization expenses related to leasehold improvements, capital equipment, capitalized internal-use software development costs, and acquisition related intangibles of $9.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $8.8 million, which was primarily related to shares of restricted common stock that were granted to certain employees in 2016 and stock options granted to employees, which were partially offset by non-cash income from the change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $6.2 million and a $9.5 million deferred tax benefit primarily due to the release of a significant portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognition of an additional benefit related to tax windfall benefits generated during the year ended December 31, 2017. The significant factors that contributed to the change in operating assets and liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits accruals as of December 31, 2017, and an increase in accounts payable as of December 31, 2017. The increase in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to new revenues generated from our MRM service contracts during 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and reflected $158.8 million paid in connection with the acquisitions of DoseMe and PrescribeWellness, net of cash acquired. In addition, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $14.5 million in software development costs, $7.5 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of equipment and improvements for our expanded office space at our Moorestown, New Jersey headquarters and our new research facility in Lake Nona, Florida and $1.2 million in connection with the purchase of developed technology to support our MRM services. Net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received from the repayment of the $1.0 million note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd in 2018.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and reflected $32.2 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify. Net cash used in investing activities included $5.6 million of software development costs related to costs associated with internally developed software. Net cash used in investing activities also included $5.0 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to purchases of new pharmacy dispensing equipment, equipment and improvements for our new office space in Tucson, Arizona for SRx and improvements for our spaces in Austin, Texas and Gainesville, Florida dedicated to our MRM service call centers. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $1.0 million related to the note receivable issued to DoseMe Holdings Pty Ltd.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and reflected $34.5 million, net of cash acquired, paid in connection with the acquisition of SRx. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included $3.3 million in purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, primarily related to our office space and headquarters in Moorestown, New Jersey, our new space in South Carolina dedicated to software development, and new space in South San Francisco, California dedicated to pharmacy dispensing, which we began to occupy in February 2017. Net cash used in investing activities also consisted of $3.3 million in software development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily reflected gross proceeds of $325.0 million from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, $65.9 million from the proceeds of the warrant transactions and $3.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially offset by a payment of $101.7 million for the convertible hedge options entered into in connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, a payment of $45.0 million to repay the amounts outstanding on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line of Credit, $29.1 million in payments for the contingent purchase price consideration related to the SRx, Peak PACE, and DoseMe acquisitions, $9.6 million in payments for debt financing costs, and $968 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted of $45.0 million of borrowings on the Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line to fund the acquisitions of Peak PACE, Mediture, and Cognify, $3.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and $156 thousand received as a result of a disgorgement related to short swing profits. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was partially offset by $2.9 million in payments for the repurchase of common stock, a $1.6 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition, $1.1 million in payments of long-term debt, and $539 thousand in payments for debt financing and costs associated with our common stock offering completed in December 2017.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and consisted of $34.9 million of cash proceeds, net of underwriting costs, from our common stock offering, which was partially offset by $2.1 million in payments for payroll taxes remitted to taxing authorities on behalf of employees from shares withheld from the net exercise of stock options during 2017. Net cash used in financing activities also included a $1.5 million payment of contingent purchase price consideration related to our Medliance acquisition and $600 thousand of payments related to our acquisition related consideration for 9176-1916 Quebec Inc., $959 thousand in payments for the repurchase of common stock, and $766 thousand in payments of long-term debt.\nFunding Requirements\nOn February 12, 2019, we issued and sold convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the offering and the remaining net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, fund the final payments related to the Peak PACE and SRx acquisition-relation contingent consideration liabilities, fund the PrescribeWellness acquisition in March 2019 and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we have $59.8 million available for borrowings under our Amended and Restated 2015 Revolving Line, and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants related to the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit as of December 31, 2019. See Note 12 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect to the convertible senior subordinated notes and the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash of $42.5 million as of December 31, 2019, borrowing capacity under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least March 31, 2021. Our ability to maintain successful operations will depend on, among other things, new business, the retention of clients and the effectiveness of sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\n\n (1) Contingent consideration represents the estimated future cash payments as of December 31, 2019 related to our acquisition of Cognify in 2018. See Note 5 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (2) Finance lease obligations represent future lease payments for equipment including interest. \n (3) The operating lease obligations represent future lease payments for office space. \n (4) We are contingently liable for $200 thousand under an outstanding letter of credit related to our lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in Moorestown, New Jersey. The letter of credit renews annually and expires in September 2027. \n (5) Effective December 2018, we entered into a vendor agreement with a vendor to provide information technology related services that commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $2.0 million in the first three years of the contract. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.6 million was remaining under the contract. In addition, effective January 1, 2020, we entered into an updated agreement with our data aggregation partner for our pharmacy cost management services, which commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of $30 thousand per month for 36 months. \nOur existing office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew and generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.\nIn addition, effective March 2019, we entered into an Affiliated Pharmacy Agreement and Pharmaceutical Program Supply Agreement with Thrifty Drug Stores, Inc. to provide us with the pharmaceutical products that we sell. The contract commits us to a minimum purchase obligation of 98% of our total prescription product requirements from Thrifty Drug Stores through September 2020.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table and described above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nWe base this management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to: (i) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, (ii) the recognition and disclosure of contingent liabilities, (iii) the useful lives of long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets), (iv) the evaluation of revenue recognition criteria, (v) assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation instruments, (vi) the realizability of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, (vii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases, and (viii) the assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible debt instruments and related equity-classified conversion option. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis\nfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. You should consider your evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations with these policies, judgments and estimates in mind.\nWhile we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to the judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe provide technology-enabled solutions tailored toward the specific needs of healthcare organizations, including payers, providers, and pharmacies. These solutions can be integrated or provided on a standalone basis. Contracts generally have a term of one to five years and in some cases automatically renew at the end of the initial term. In most cases, clients may terminate their contracts with a notice period ranging from 0 to 180 days without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we have enforceable rights and obligations. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected in exchange for the goods or services. We use the practical expedient not to account for significant financing components because the period between recognition and collection does not exceed one year for most of our contracts.\nProduct Revenue\nMRM prescription fulfillment services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide prescription fulfillment pharmacy services, including dispensing and delivery of an unknown mix and quantity of medications, directly to healthcare organizations. Revenue from medication risk management, or MRM, prescription fulfillment services is recognized when medications are delivered to the client. At the time of delivery, we have performed substantially all of our performance obligations under our client contracts and we do not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments\nService Revenue\nMRM services. We provide an array of medication risk management services. These services include identification of high risk individuals, patient engagement, medication regimen reviews, and software for pharmacists to track clinical interventions regarding optimizing medication therapy, including dosing, and methodologies to increase adherence. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees, monthly subscription fees, and a fee for each comprehensive medication review completed. MRM per member per month fees and monthly subscription fees are recognized based on their relative stand-alone selling prices as the services are provided. Additionally, certain of our MRM service contracts include a performance guarantee based on the number of comprehensive medication reviews completed and guarantees by us for specific service level performance. For these contracts, revenue is recognized as comprehensive medication reviews are completed at their relative stand-alone selling price which is estimated based on our assessment of the total transaction price under each contract. The stand-alone selling price and amount of variable consideration recognized are adjusted as necessary at the end of each reporting period.\nHealth plan management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide risk adjustment services, electronic health record solutions and third party administration services, which we collectively refer to as health plan management services. The performance obligations are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to these performance obligations primarily consists of per member per month fees. Revenue from these contracts is recognized monthly as the health plan management services are provided. The revenue includes the contractual per member per month rate and fees for these services are generally billed monthly.\nPharmacy cost management services. We have a stand ready obligation to provide monthly pharmacy cost management services which includes adjudication, pricing validation, utilization analysis and pharmacy transaction review services. The performance obligation is a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. Revenue related to this performance obligation primarily consists of subscription fees based on a monthly flat fee or a percentage of monthly transactions incurred. Revenue from these stand ready services is recognized monthly as the pharmacy cost management services are provided at the contractual subscription fee rate. We also generate revenue from the sale of drug utilization data to drug manufacturers. Revenues related to the sale of drug\nutilization data are recognized when the data is submitted to the drug manufacturers based upon an estimate that uses historical data, and are adjusted as necessary to reflect new information. Drug utilization data is generally submitted monthly and fees from the sale of drug utilization data are collected approximately 180 days after submission.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to contingent consideration are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe account for contingent consideration in accordance with applicable guidance provided within the business combination accounting rules. As part of our consideration for the SRx, Peak PACE, Cognify and DoseMe acquisitions, we were and, with respect to certain acquisitions, are contractually obligated to pay certain consideration resulting from the outcome of future events. Therefore, we are required to update our underlying assumptions each reporting period, based on new developments, and record such contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingency is resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities are recognized each reporting period and included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nExamples of critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include:\n \u25cf future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies; \n \u25cf the acquired company's trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio; \n \u25cf the probability of meeting the future events; and \n \u25cf discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. \nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill consists of the excess purchase price over fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually. GAAP provides an entity an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test. If this is the case, the two-step goodwill impairment test is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. If the two-step goodwill impairment test is required, first, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.\nFactors we generally consider important in our qualitative assessment that could trigger a step-two impairment test include significant underperformance relative to expected operating trends, significant changes in the way assets are used, underutilization of our tangible assets, discontinuance of certain products by us or by our clients, changes in the competitive environment and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of property and equipment, software development costs and definite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, we compare forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount.

provides technology-enabled solutions for medication risk management. Revenues were $284.7 million in 2019, up from $204.3 million in 2018. Net loss was $32.4 million in 2019 compared to $47.3 million in 2018. \n\n- Product revenue from prescription fulfillment services increased 22% from 2018 to 2019 due to new clients and increased volume from existing clients. Service revenue increased 61% largely due to acquisitions.\n\n- Gross margin declined in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased costs related to acquisitions, higher personnel costs, and increased volume. Operating expenses increased due to acquisitions, higher R&D costs, and increased general and administrative expenses.\n\n- Net cash used in operating activities was $5.8 million in 2019 compared to net cash provided of $15.8 million in 2018. Cash used in investing activities was $180.9 million in 2019, primarily for acquisitions, versus $43.8 million in 2018. Cash from financing was $208.3 million in 2019 mainly from debt issuance, compared to $42.6 million in 2018.\n\n- As of December 31, 2019, TRHC had $42.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $59.8 million available under its revolving credit facility.\n\n- TRHC believes its available cash, borrowing capacity, and cash from operations will sufficiently fund operations through at least March 2021. Additional funding may be needed through debt or equity financing.\n\nIn summary, TRHC grew revenues substantially in 2019 but at the expense of profitability. The company made significant investments in acquisitions impacting cash flows. TRHC appears to have adequate liquidity for the next 12 months based on current projections."}
