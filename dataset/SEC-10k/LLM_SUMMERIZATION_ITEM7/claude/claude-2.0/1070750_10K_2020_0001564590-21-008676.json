This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of Host L.P.'s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.'s day-to-day management and control.\nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, we own 80 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 64%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2020 room sales. By comparison, our 2019 room sales consisted of 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, for transient business, group business and contract business. Transient business broadly represents individual business and leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand during the period April 2020 to present has primarily been driven by leisure customers. For a discussion of our customer categories, see Item 1 Business - Our Customers\u201d.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically. The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other governmental authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted.\nWe have not filed for any relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); however, several of our operators, including Hyatt and Marriott, have filed for the Employee Retention Credit ( ERC\u201d) to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under Title II of the CARES Act, as discussed below. Benefits received by our operators from the ERC related to employees at our hotels ultimately will benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels.\nIn response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have taken the following actions:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> As of February 19, 2021, reopened 31 of the 35 hotels that had suspended operations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the timing for widespread availability of vaccines and, as a result, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict. We, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.\nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses. Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).\nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of 2020 Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of 2019 Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rooms revenues.

It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 59% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators. The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hotel occupancy is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) is a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenues per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> total revenues per available room ( Total RevPAR\u201d) is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by\nincreases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> NAREIT Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA. All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability.

Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDAre for property insurance gains, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn discussing our operating results, we typically present RevPAR and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. For this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or 2020; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. We also present RevPAR separately for our consolidated domestic and foreign (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels. We provide RevPAR results in constant currency due to the consolidated hotels that we own in Canada and Brazil and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. We use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. For all other measures (net income, operating profit, EBITDA, FFO, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal US$, which is consistent with the presentation of our financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nSummary of 2020 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss) margin under GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings (loss) per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.04\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAREIT FFO per diluted share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (.31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted FFO per diluted share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (.17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll Owned Hotel Data:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 Owned Hotels (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel revenues (pro forma) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel EBITDA (pro forma) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel EBITDA margin (pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) Total RevPAR - Constant US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) RevPAR - Constant US$ (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) RevPAR - Nominal US$ (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and all owned hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC.

An overall decline in travel as well as the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and on-going travel restrictions have significantly reduced demand at our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma RevPAR decreased 70.3% compared to 2019, on a constant US$ basis, due to a 5,260 basis point decline in occupancy to 26.0%. All owned hotel pro forma Total RevPAR decreased 69.4% for the year as food and beverage revenues also experienced significant declines due to the decline in occupancy. (see Statement of Operations Results and Trends\u201d).\nFollowing RevPAR increases in January and February 2020 across the majority of the portfolio, we experienced unprecedented occupancy declines in the second quarter, followed by modest sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters. The incremental quarterly improvement in the second half of the year was driven by increased demand in drive-to leisure markets. As a result, all owned hotel Total RevPAR in our Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Miami markets declined the least during the year, with decreases of 40.6%, 46.1% and 46.6%, respectively, due primarily to short-term leisure demand in the second half of the year. All owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Phoenix properties declined 51.1% during the year, also benefiting from leisure business, which led to strong golf revenues at two of our properties in that market, while all owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu properties declined 69.6%, with operations suspended for three of our hotels through the third quarter followed by hotel reopenings and loosening travel restrictions in the fourth quarter. Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose and New York, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines in all owned hotel Total RevPAR of 74.5% and 80.3%, respectively, due to suspension of operations for a portion of the year at several of these hotels. The largest all owned hotel Total RevPAR declines occurred in our Boston and Chicago markets, with decreases of 84.8% and 82.7%, respectively, as operations remain suspended at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Westin Chicago River North.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) declined in 2020 to (58.8)% due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit margins under GAAP also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined to (8.5)% for the year.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. decreased $1,673 million in 2020 to a loss of $741 million primarily due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a $132 million decrease in other gains/(losses), consisting primarily of lower gain on sale of assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. These results led to a diluted loss per common share for Host Inc. of $1.04. Adjusted EBITDAre, which excludes, among other items, gain on sale of assets, impairment expense and severance expense, decreased to $(168) million for the year, while Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which excludes gain on sale of assets and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, impairment and severance, decreased to $(0.17) in 2020.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\n2021 Outlook\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2021. While economic growth and business investment are expected to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, supported by further stimulus, low interest rates, and vaccine distribution, government-imposed restrictions across the U.S. remain. Many regions continue to grapple with the early 2021 surge in outbreaks and new variants of the virus, which has resulted in elevated jobless claims and slower economic activity in the first part of the year. While forecasts for 2021 remain uncertain, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real GDP of 4.9% for the year, while business investment is anticipated to increase 6.8%. Though analysts believe the unemployment rate peaked in 2020, it is anticipated to remain elevated into 2021, with an expected average of 5.8% for the year. The range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically is exceptionally wide, reflecting both the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and varying analyst assumptions surrounding infection rates, new virus variants and the timing of vaccine deployments.\nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2021, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges resulted in project delays across the U.S. A large percentage of U.S. hotels closed temporarily in 2020, and while many have begun to reopen, we anticipate that the number of permanent hotel closures will be higher than historical averages. The pandemic's outsized impact on our industry has resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between increased business investment and RevPAR growth. RevPAR recovery is anticipated to lag that of the broader U.S. economy, despite lower supply growth. Luxury and upper upscale hotels in top markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. While we have seen slightly improving trends, we anticipate that these factors will persist in 2021.\nAs a result of the significant uncertainties related to the timing of vaccine deployment, further government stimulus and related policy, and resulting broader macroeconomic trends in 2021, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slow return of corporate and group travel, as businesses likely will remain cautious. While investor optimism has grown in the early part of 2021 as analysts focus on the potential for significant pent-up leisure demand, existing corporate policies are expected to continue to constrain nonessential business transient and group travel until the country approaches herd immunity. Given the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its effect on our industry, we are not able to provide a full year forecast for RevPAR at this time. We believe that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. Accordingly, we believe the recovery in 2021 likely will be gradual and that the impact on specific markets and industries will be uneven.\nAs noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. There can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2021, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting the Brazil and Canada markets in order to focus on our domestic portfolio. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\nDispositions. We completed the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa in 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $202 million. Additionally, in transactions completed during the year, we sold a total of 38 acres of land adjacent to The Phoenician for $83 million.\nFinancing transactions. Senior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of approximately $733 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior Notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects. A portion of the proceeds were used in August 2020 to repay approximately 81% of the outstanding 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $390 million, including $26 million of prepayment costs. Additionally, the remaining $86 million of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $94 million, including a premium of approximately $8 million. This eliminated the final series of senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating, and therefore any covenants or restrictions under our non-investment grade senior notes indentures no longer are applicable.\nCredit Facility. During the year, we had a net draw of $1,483 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Additionally, in June 2020 and February 2021, we amended the terms of our credit facility, under which the quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. Following the covenant waiver period, certain financial maintenance covenants are modified through the third quarter of 2023.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. Through our transactions in 2020, we were able to lower our weighted average interest rate to 3.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2019, and extended our weighted average debt maturity to 5.0 years. We have a debt balance of $5.5 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nFor a detailed discussion, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5. Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Projects. We continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2020, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures, of which $343 million represented return on investment ( ROI\u201d) capital expenditures and $156 million represented renewal and replacement projects.\nIn collaboration with Marriott, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2018 on an initial 17 properties, now 16 properties following the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, that is expected to occur over a four-year period. We believe these investments will make these hotels more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. To accelerate this process, we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements, or approximately an average of $175 million per year, which amounts are included in the forecast range of 2021 capital expenditures reflected below. In exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, over the four years to offset expected business disruption.\nOf the 16 properties included in the program, we substantially completed the projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019 and projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020. Work is underway at seven other properties. Approximately 65% of the total estimated costs of the transformational capital program have been spent as of December 31, 2020 and, in 2021, we expect to substantially complete four additional properties, including: The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Medical Center Marriott and Orlando World Center Marriott.\nIn 2021, we also have several projects scheduled to be completed or initiated that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. These include:\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> AC Hotel Scottsdale North - using an underutilized parking lot alongside The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, we developed a 165-room select-service hotel branded as an AC by Marriott.

We received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020 from Marriott and expect to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The total expected capital spend consists of $275 million to $325 million of ROI projects and $100 million to $150 million of renewal and replacement projects. We have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million, if required, to conserve cash.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends. On August 5, 2019, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 8.9 million common shares at an average price of $16.49 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $147 million, prior to suspending our repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. Repurchases are currently restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment.\nDuring 2020, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in the first quarter, with respect to Host Inc.'s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.2042988 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2020. As part of its response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, Host suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend commencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in July 2020.\nThere can be no assurances as to when dividends will be restored but, based on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. However, while the dividend is suspended to preserve cash and liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two

Total rooms revenues decreased $2,455 million, or 71.6%, in 2020. Rooms revenues in 2019 include $196 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nFood and beverage. Total F&B revenues decreased $1,221 million, or 74.1%, in 2020. F&B revenues in 2019 include $77 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nOther revenues. Total other revenues decreased $173 million, or 44.2%, in 2019. Attrition and cancelation fees increased $3 million compared to 2019. Other revenues in 2019 include $26 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food and beverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other departmental and support expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other property-level expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total property-level operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 59% of these expenses in any year. During 2020, these expenses declined 54% compared to 2019, excluding the severance expense discussed below. Included in these amounts in 2020 is $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers and special pay, partially offset by approximately $39 million related to the ERC recorded by our managers. We also recorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, which has been excluded from the wage and benefit discussions below. Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe decline in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees predominantly are due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as follows:\nRooms. Rooms expenses decreased $511 million, or 58.5%, during 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses and 66% of our 2019 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage. F&B expenses decreased $700 million, or 62.5%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 74% of our 2020 F&B expenses and 70% of our 2019 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses. Other departmental and support expenses decreased $609 million, or 47.0%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses and 41% of our 2019 other departmental and support expenses.\nManagement fees. Total management fees decreased $200 million, or 83.7%, in 2020. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased $119 million, or 72.1%, compared to 2019. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $91 million, as we did not pay incentive management fees during 2020.\nOther property-level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses decreased $53 million, or 14.5%, in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2020 and 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $11 million, or 1.6%, to $665 million in 2020, due to impairment expense that was recorded in 2019.\nOther Income and Expenses\nCorporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. In 2020, corporate and other expenses declined by approximately 17% compared to 2019, as a result of reduced compensation, travel and other overhead. In 2019, corporate and other expenses include costs associated with a significant transformation of our corporate information systems platform, the implementation of which was completed in the second quarter of 2019.\nGain on insurance and business interruption settlements. In 2019, we received $27 million of property insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma, that occurred in 2017, resulting in a gain of $4 million.\nInterest income. Interest income decreased $24 million, or 75.0%, in 2020 due to a decline in interest rates.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $28 million, or 12.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting the benefits from refinancing activities in 2019 and 2020 as well as a decline in floating interest rates, which was partially offset by increased principal balances outstanding due to the credit facility draw. Interest expense for 2020 also reflects less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the Series C senior notes compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2019 on the Series Z and Series B senior notes.

In 2020, we recorded a loss of $30 million related to our unconsolidated investments. This included a $14 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, in addition to operating losses incurred by our investments. In 2019, we recorded earnings of $14 million from our unconsolidated investments.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes. We lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, such domestic net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. Any domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income. We expect to generate additional net operating losses from our TRS in 2021 and we will evaluate whether or not to record an income tax benefit for all or a portion of such net operating loss at that time. The 2019 income tax provision of $30 million primarily related to hotel operations at our TRS. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7. Income Taxes\u201d for a discussion of our income taxes.\nHotel RevPAR Overview\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. See All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics\u201d for a complete description of our methodology. We also discuss our Hotel RevPAR results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\n2020 Compared to 2019\nHotel Operating Data by Location.\nThe following

The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nOverview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We were able to take further steps in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.\nUnder the current challenging operating environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by drawing on our credit facility, working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotel, reducing corporate level expenses, suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases and deferring certain capital expenditures projects to future years. These actions contributed to lowering our cash used in operating activities each quarter following the beginning of the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund negative operations at our hotels, corporate expenses and reduced levels of capital expenditures. However, we also are well positioned to execute acquisitions to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise.\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in operating cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures programs. We may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2019 to 2020 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflects our actions to preserve financial liquidity:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash shown on the statements of cash flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (558\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net draws (repayments) on credit facility revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuances of senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase/redemption of senior notes, including extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (485\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Host Inc.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock repurchases and dividends on common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (467\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Host L.P.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchases of common OP units and distributions on common OP units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (470\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Requirements.

Our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2021 are approximately $32 million. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. Our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 91 years, while other operating obligations are generally short term in nature. We have no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $375 million to $475 million in 2021, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As part of our COVID-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend currently is suspended and we are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP Units under the terms of our credit facility amendment as discussed below. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees.\nCapital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2,335 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $139 million in our FF&E escrow reserve. We have substantially utilized the $1.5 billion revolver under our credit facility to increase our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt payments, operating and corporate costs, primarily with our existing cash reserves due to the negative operating cash from operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2020 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if our hotel operations remain at current negative operating levels.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. Following the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. However, we currently are below the interest coverage ratio required under our senior notes indentures to incur additional debt and, while not an event of default, we will be unable to incur additional debt while we remain below the required covenant level.\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2021, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.\nIn February 2017, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Host Inc. common stock, and on August 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Under the terms of our credit facility amendment in 2020, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash. In 2020, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, draws on our credit facility revolver and dispositions. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, repurchases of common stock and distributions to equity holders. We do not anticipate significant cash from operations in 2021 and we are restricted from issuing debt under the covenants of our senior notes indenture. However, we have significant available cash and also have access to stock issuances and property dispositions as alternative sources of cash. Primary uses of cash are expected to include continued funding of operating shortfalls at our properties, interest and other corporate expenses and capital expenditures. Subject to market conditions, other uses of cash may include property acquisitions or other investments.\nCash Provided by/Used in Operations. Our net cash used in operations for 2020 was $307 million compared to cash provided by operations in 2019 of $1,250 million due primarily to the decline in operations at our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties. In the first quarter of 2020, our portfolio provided cash from operations due to positive operating results in January and February. However, beginning with the second quarter, we experienced significant cash outflows from operating activities which continued through the second half of the year. However, net cash used in operations did decrease in each sequential quarter as a result of reducing operating costs at our hotels and the slightly improving levels of operations. The following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2020:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (172\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $195 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2020 compared to $58 million provided in 2019. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures in 2020, compared to $558 million in 2019. These amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $12 million, $12 million and $11 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and return of investments in affiliates from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> Transaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description of Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition of 1 Hotel South Beach\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (610\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (610\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,231 million for 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,315 million in 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the issuance of $750 million of 3.5% Series I senior notes and a draw on the credit facility, while 2019 included the issuance of $650 million of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 included the repayment of the Series C senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series I senior notes, and the redemption of preferred OP units and cash used in 2019 included the repayment of senior notes. While cash used in 2020 and 2019 both included stock repurchases and dividend payments, payments in 2020 for these items were $638 million lower compared to 2019, as we suspended dividends and repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table summarizes significant issuances, net of deferred financing costs and issuance discounts, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> Transaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description of Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Issuances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August - September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Issuance of $750 million 3.5% Series I senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March - December\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net draw on the revolver portion of the credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Proceeds from the issuance of $650 million 3\u215c% Series H senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total issuances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents significant debt repayments, including prepayment premiums, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description of Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repayment of $86 million 4.75% Series C senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repayment of $364 million 4.75% Series C senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (390\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of preferred OP units of Host LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of $300 million of 6% Series Z senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of $350 million of 5\u00bc% Series B senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (377\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net repayment on the revolver portion of credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total cash repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity/Capital Transactions.

On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes. The proceeds were used to make a tender offer for our Series C senior notes and to improve our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Series I senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the September 15, 2030 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series I senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2020 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.'s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.\nThe following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Covenant Requirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unencumbered assets test\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 150%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total indebtedness to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured indebtedness to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are in compliance with certain of the financial ratios applicable to our senior notes as of December 31, 2020, but we fell below the 1.5x requirement for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio starting as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 and, as a result, while not in default, we will not be able to incur additional debt while the ratio remains below this requirement. We expect to continue to be below the 1.5x interest coverage ratio and hence will be unable to incur additional debt until operations substantially improve from current levels.\nCredit Facility. On August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity, other than those required during the Covenant Relief Period as set forth below. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees. Similar to our senior note indentures, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments. Voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.\nFinancial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ( leverage ratio\u201d) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. Except as set forth below during the Covenant Relief Period, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt\u201d concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.\nAmendments. On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on July 1, 2020 and ending on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the Covenant Relief Period\u201d). The existing financial maintenance covenants are reinstated for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, except that after the reinstatement instead of using the prior four calendar quarters' results in the calculations, only results for the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter are used during a phase in period. In addition, for the second quarter of 2022, the only financial covenant that shall be required to be satisfied shall be a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of such quarter. For the fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period (i.e., after June 30, 2022), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the Amendments shall apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the Covenant Relief\nPeriod and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter. The Amendments permit us to terminate the Covenant Relief Period at any time, subject to demonstrating satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants that otherwise would apply for the quarter ending June 30, 2022.\nThe Amendments also provide for, among other things:\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings during the Covenant Relief Period, with the rate being increased by 40 basis points to the applicable rate across the credit rating-based pricing grid determined according to our unsecured long-term debt rating;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the addition of a permanent LIBOR floor of 15 basis points applicable to borrowings under the revolver and the term facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the addition of a minimum liquidity covenant, which requires a minimum liquidity level of $400,000,000 at the end of each calendar month until the end of the Covenant Relief Period (subject to potential increase in the case of any future acquisitions of hotels, but not to exceed $600 million);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on acquisitions which provide that we may make acquisitions including (i) property exchange transactions governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) acquisitions of up to $7,500,000,000 funded by issuances of equity and (iii) acquisitions of up to $2,000,000,000 funded by existing liquidity and up to $500 million of asset sales as long as we maintain minimum total liquidity of up to $600,000,000, depending on the amount of the acquisition; we also may assume debt in acquisitions, if permitted under our senior notes indenture, provided that the debt to undepreciated real estate assets ratio shall not exceed 0.35:1.00 calculated on a pro forma basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on the ability to make distributions and repurchases or redemptions, with certain exceptions, including the ability to make distributions sufficient to allow for the payment of a quarterly common cash dividend by Host Inc. of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, and annual distributions of up to $50 million for any preferred OP units which Host L.P. may issue;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on debt incurrence such that we can incur indebtedness only if the incurrence is permitted under our senior notes indenture;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> limitations on the ability to make stock repurchases or OP unit redemptions following the Covenant Relief Period if the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.25:1.00, subject to certain exceptions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> limitations on the ability to make capital expenditures from the period beginning on the effective date and ending on March 31, 2022 (or any earlier date on which the Covenant Relief Period is terminated); during this period we can fund all emergency, life safety and ordinary course maintenance capital expenditures plus $950,000,000 in other capital expenditures, such as return on investment capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a requirement during the Covenant Relief Period to apply the net cash proceeds in excess of $350,000,000 in the aggregate from asset sales and debt issuances (but not equity issuances) as a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility; the mandatory prepayment requirements for asset sales and debt issuances are subject to various exceptions, including, among other things, (1) the net cash proceeds of asset sales in an amount of up to $750,000,000 that are used in a property exchange transaction governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) net cash proceeds up to $500 million of asset sales that are used to acquire assets unencumbered by debt, (3) the net cash proceeds of debt issuances constituting refinancing indebtedness, (4) certain indebtedness assumed in acquisitions and (5) other indebtedness up to $10,000,000. Following the issuance of the Series I Senior Notes and the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, we have maximized the $350 million net cash proceeds capacity available to Host, and therefore future excess cash proceeds will be applied in accordance with the repayment terms of the Amendments unless they fit into one of the exceptions set forth above.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender's commitments under the revolver and term facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, for informational purposes only, as the covenants are not currently in effect under the Amendments:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Covenant Requirement\nfor all years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.9\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 7.25x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.25x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.75x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. Based on Host L.P.'s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is 165 basis points.\nBorrowings under our revolver (currently $1.5 billion) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in LIBOR. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR over time. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023. There currently is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Our credit facility provides that in the event LIBOR no longer is published, we and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowing at the higher of the federal funds rate plus \u00bd of 1% or the prime rate\u201d announced by Bank of America, N.A.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $145 million at December 31, 2020. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends. Host Inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. After paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, Host Inc. suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the credit facility, we agreed to substantial limitations on our ability to pay common cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period as discussed above.\nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2020, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.'s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit. During the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.\nCounterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d:\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Property and Equipment - Impairment testing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.\nConstant US$ and Nominal US$\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe that this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.\nSimilarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA\nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,\u201d to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Property Insurance Gains - We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquisition Costs - Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Litigation Gains and Losses - We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Severance Expense - Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company's current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre to net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions)\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (220\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on dispositions (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (334\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash impairment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investment adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pro rata EBITDAre of equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to EBITDAre:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance at hotel properties (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on property insurance settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Net income (loss), EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a gain of $59 million from the sale of land adjacent to The Phoenician hotel and a loss of $14 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Reflects the sale of one hotel in 2020 and 14 hotels in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Including severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO would have been $(233) and $(184) million, respectively, for 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT's definition of FFO included in NAREIT's Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. The adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate NAREIT FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt - We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquisition Costs -Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred.

We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc.

Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\u201d above. We present all owned hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWhile management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our all owned hotel pro forma results for the periods presented herein:\nAll Owned Hotel Pro Forma Results for

This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of Host L.P.'s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.'s day-to-day management and control.\nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, we own 80 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 64%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2020 room sales. By comparison, our 2019 room sales consisted of 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, for transient business, group business and contract business. Transient business broadly represents individual business and leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand during the period April 2020 to present has primarily been driven by leisure customers. For a discussion of our customer categories, see Item 1 Business - Our Customers\u201d.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically. The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other governmental authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted.\nWe have not filed for any relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); however, several of our operators, including Hyatt and Marriott, have filed for the Employee Retention Credit ( ERC\u201d) to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under Title II of the CARES Act, as discussed below. Benefits received by our operators from the ERC related to employees at our hotels ultimately will benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels.\nIn response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have taken the following actions:\n \u2022 As of February 19, 2021, reopened 31 of the 35 hotels that had suspended operations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will maintain operations or reopen a property when it is anticipated to generate revenue greater than the incremental costs associated with staying open; \n \u2022 Average monthly occupancy (which includes the results of hotels with suspended operations) has increased during the pandemic from 6.9% in April to 17.3% in December, due primarily to increased demand in drive-to leisure markets; \n \u2022 Working with our hotel managers, we implemented portfolio-wide cost reductions, including significantly reducing staffing levels by furloughing or severing a substantial portion of the hotel workforce, reduced shared services fees, suspended food and beverage outlet operations, closed guestroom floors and meeting space, and temporarily suspended brand standards. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction of hotel operating costs across the portfolio by over 50% for the year, excluding severance, compared to 2019. We expect that certain initiatives, including modernized brand standards, \n streamlined operating departments and accelerated adoption of cost-saving technologies, may lead to long-term expense reductions over time; \n \u2022 Paid health benefits of approximately $112 million during the year for hotel employees furloughed by our managers and special pay and accrued $13 million at year-end for similar payments to be made in the first quarter of 2021. A portion of the furlough costs has been offset by ERC of approximately $39 million recorded for the year. We also recorded $65 million during the year for hotel-level severance costs; \n \u2022 Suspended contributions to our hotels' FF&E escrow accounts and suspended or deferred non-essential capital projects, which reduced full year 2020 capital expenditures by over $100 million compared to the forecast range as reported in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K; \n \u2022 Successfully amended the credit agreement governing our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and two $500 million term loans. Under the amendments, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022, with certain financial covenants modified through the third quarter of 2023; \n \u2022 Accessed the full $1.5 billion under the revolver portion of the credit facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of continued uncertainty in the global markets; \n \u2022 Suspended regular quarterly common cash dividends and stock repurchases until further notice. All future dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors; and \n \u2022 Reduced corporate expenses by approximately 16.8% for the year compared to 2019, through reduced travel, compensation and other overhead. \nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, together with the response of our hotel operators. There remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the timing for widespread availability of vaccines and, as a result, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict. We, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.\nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses. Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).\nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of 2020 Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of 2019 Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rooms revenues.

It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 59% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators. The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS:\n \u2022 hotel occupancy is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold; \n \u2022 average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) is a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold; \n \u2022 revenues per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and \n \u2022 total revenues per available room ( Total RevPAR\u201d) is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR. \nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by\nincreases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\n \u2022 NAREIT Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business. \n \u2022 All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA. All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our hotels. \n \u2022 EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDAre for property insurance gains, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). \nIn discussing our operating results, we typically present RevPAR and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. For this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or 2020; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. We also present RevPAR separately for our consolidated domestic and foreign (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels. We provide RevPAR results in constant currency due to the consolidated hotels that we own in Canada and Brazil and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. We use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. For all other measures (net income, operating profit, EBITDA, FFO, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal US$, which is consistent with the presentation of our financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nSummary of 2020 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss) margin under GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings (loss) per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.04\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAREIT FFO per diluted share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (.31\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted FFO per diluted share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (.17\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll Owned Hotel Data:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 Owned Hotels (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel revenues (pro forma) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel EBITDA (pro forma) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All owned hotel EBITDA margin (pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) Total RevPAR - Constant US$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) RevPAR - Constant US$ (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in all owned hotel (pro forma) RevPAR - Nominal US$ (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and all owned hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. Beginning in 2020, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO to exclude non-ordinary course severance costs, and remove these severance costs from property level operating results, which we believe provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. Furlough costs, which are viewed as a replacement to wages, will continue to be included in these metrics. Including these severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO would have been $(233) and $(184), respectively. Including severance costs, our All Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(202) million. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. \nN/M = Not meaningful.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues declined $3,849 million, or 70.4%, compared to 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we experienced a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel beginning in mid-March 2020. An overall decline in travel as well as the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and on-going travel restrictions have significantly reduced demand at our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma RevPAR decreased 70.3% compared to 2019, on a constant US$ basis, due to a 5,260 basis point decline in occupancy to 26.0%. All owned hotel pro forma Total RevPAR decreased 69.4% for the year as food and beverage revenues also experienced significant declines due to the decline in occupancy. (see Statement of Operations Results and Trends\u201d).\nFollowing RevPAR increases in January and February 2020 across the majority of the portfolio, we experienced unprecedented occupancy declines in the second quarter, followed by modest sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters. The incremental quarterly improvement in the second half of the year was driven by increased demand in drive-to leisure markets. As a result, all owned hotel Total RevPAR in our Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Miami markets declined the least during the year, with decreases of 40.6%, 46.1% and 46.6%, respectively, due primarily to short-term leisure demand in the second half of the year. All owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Phoenix properties declined 51.1% during the year, also benefiting from leisure business, which led to strong golf revenues at two of our properties in that market, while all owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu properties declined 69.6%, with operations suspended for three of our hotels through the third quarter followed by hotel reopenings and loosening travel restrictions in the fourth quarter. Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose and New York, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines in all owned hotel Total RevPAR of 74.5% and 80.3%, respectively, due to suspension of operations for a portion of the year at several of these hotels. The largest all owned hotel Total RevPAR declines occurred in our Boston and Chicago markets, with decreases of 84.8% and 82.7%, respectively, as operations remain suspended at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Westin Chicago River North.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) declined in 2020 to (58.8)% due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit margins under GAAP also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined to (8.5)% for the year.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. decreased $1,673 million in 2020 to a loss of $741 million primarily due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a $132 million decrease in other gains/(losses), consisting primarily of lower gain on sale of assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. These results led to a diluted loss per common share for Host Inc. of $1.04. Adjusted EBITDAre, which excludes, among other items, gain on sale of assets, impairment expense and severance expense, decreased to $(168) million for the year, while Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which excludes gain on sale of assets and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, impairment and severance, decreased to $(0.17) in 2020.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\n2021 Outlook\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2021. While economic growth and business investment are expected to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, supported by further stimulus, low interest rates, and vaccine distribution, government-imposed restrictions across the U.S. remain. Many regions continue to grapple with the early 2021 surge in outbreaks and new variants of the virus, which has resulted in elevated jobless claims and slower economic activity in the first part of the year. While forecasts for 2021 remain uncertain, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real GDP of 4.9% for the year, while business investment is anticipated to increase 6.8%. Though analysts believe the unemployment rate peaked in 2020, it is anticipated to remain elevated into 2021, with an expected average of 5.8% for the year. The range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically is exceptionally wide, reflecting both the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and varying analyst assumptions surrounding infection rates, new virus variants and the timing of vaccine deployments.\nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2021, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges resulted in project delays across the U.S. A large percentage of U.S. hotels closed temporarily in 2020, and while many have begun to reopen, we anticipate that the number of permanent hotel closures will be higher than historical averages. The pandemic's outsized impact on our industry has resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between increased business investment and RevPAR growth. RevPAR recovery is anticipated to lag that of the broader U.S. economy, despite lower supply growth. Luxury and upper upscale hotels in top markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. While we have seen slightly improving trends, we anticipate that these factors will persist in 2021.\nAs a result of the significant uncertainties related to the timing of vaccine deployment, further government stimulus and related policy, and resulting broader macroeconomic trends in 2021, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slow return of corporate and group travel, as businesses likely will remain cautious. While investor optimism has grown in the early part of 2021 as analysts focus on the potential for significant pent-up leisure demand, existing corporate policies are expected to continue to constrain nonessential business transient and group travel until the country approaches herd immunity. Given the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its effect on our industry, we are not able to provide a full year forecast for RevPAR at this time. We believe that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. Accordingly, we believe the recovery in 2021 likely will be gradual and that the impact on specific markets and industries will be uneven.\nAs noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. There can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2021, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting the Brazil and Canada markets in order to focus on our domestic portfolio. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\nDispositions. We completed the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa in 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $202 million. Additionally, in transactions completed during the year, we sold a total of 38 acres of land adjacent to The Phoenician for $83 million.\nFinancing transactions. Senior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of approximately $733 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior Notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects. A portion of the proceeds were used in August 2020 to repay approximately 81% of the outstanding 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $390 million, including $26 million of prepayment costs. Additionally, the remaining $86 million of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $94 million, including a premium of approximately $8 million. This eliminated the final series of senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating, and therefore any covenants or restrictions under our non-investment grade senior notes indentures no longer are applicable.\nCredit Facility. During the year, we had a net draw of $1,483 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Additionally, in June 2020 and February 2021, we amended the terms of our credit facility, under which the quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. Following the covenant waiver period, certain financial maintenance covenants are modified through the third quarter of 2023.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. Through our transactions in 2020, we were able to lower our weighted average interest rate to 3.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2019, and extended our weighted average debt maturity to 5.0 years. We have a debt balance of $5.5 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nFor a detailed discussion, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5. Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Projects. We continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2020, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures, of which $343 million represented return on investment ( ROI\u201d) capital expenditures and $156 million represented renewal and replacement projects.\nIn collaboration with Marriott, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2018 on an initial 17 properties, now 16 properties following the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, that is expected to occur over a four-year period. We believe these investments will make these hotels more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. To accelerate this process, we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements, or approximately an average of $175 million per year, which amounts are included in the forecast range of 2021 capital expenditures reflected below. In exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, over the four years to offset expected business disruption.\nOf the 16 properties included in the program, we substantially completed the projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019 and projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020. Work is underway at seven other properties. Approximately 65% of the total estimated costs of the transformational capital program have been spent as of December 31, 2020 and, in 2021, we expect to substantially complete four additional properties, including: The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Medical Center Marriott and Orlando World Center Marriott.\nIn 2021, we also have several projects scheduled to be completed or initiated that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. These include:\n \u2022 AC Hotel Scottsdale North - using an underutilized parking lot alongside The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, we developed a 165-room select-service hotel branded as an AC by Marriott. The hotel was substantially completed in 2020 and opened in January 2021; \n \u2022 Additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort - development and construction of 19 additional two-bedroom, luxury villas at the Andaz Maui is underway and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021; \n \u2022 Expansion at The Ritz-Carlton Naples Golf Resort - development and construction of a 1.5-acre water park is underway and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021; \n \u2022 Expansions at the Orlando World Center Marriott - development and construction of a 2.3-acre waterpark and a 60,000 gross square-foot meeting space expansion is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022; and \n \u2022 The Ritz-Carlton Naples - a tower expansion and extensive guestroom renovation that will increase the number of suites at the property are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2021, paired with the redevelopment of public and meeting space, including the addition of a new pool and cabanas to begin in 2022, with all projects expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. \nFor 2021, we expect to make capital expenditures of $375 million to $475 million, including approximately $110 million to $140 million for the Marriott transformational capital program discussed above, which is expected to be nearly 85% complete by year-end 2021. We received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020 from Marriott and expect to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The total expected capital spend consists of $275 million to $325 million of ROI projects and $100 million to $150 million of renewal and replacement projects. We have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million, if required, to conserve cash.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends. On August 5, 2019, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 8.9 million common shares at an average price of $16.49 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $147 million, prior to suspending our repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. Repurchases are currently restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment.\nDuring 2020, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in the first quarter, with respect to Host Inc.'s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.2042988 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2020. As part of its response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, Host suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend commencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in July 2020.\nThere can be no assurances as to when dividends will be restored but, based on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. However, while the dividend is suspended to preserve cash and liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two

beginning in March of 2020. After a significant decline in revenues in the second quarter, revenues gradually improved through subsequent quarters, although they remained well below historical levels. Our 2020 revenues on a quarterly basis were as follows:\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRooms. Total rooms revenues decreased $2,455 million, or 71.6%, in 2020. Rooms revenues in 2019 include $196 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nFood and beverage. Total F&B revenues decreased $1,221 million, or 74.1%, in 2020. F&B revenues in 2019 include $77 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nOther revenues. Total other revenues decreased $173 million, or 44.2%, in 2019. Attrition and cancelation fees increased $3 million compared to 2019. Other revenues in 2019 include $26 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rooms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food and beverage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other departmental and support expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other property-level expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total property-level operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 59% of these expenses in any year. During 2020, these expenses declined 54% compared to 2019, excluding the severance expense discussed below. Included in these amounts in 2020 is $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers and special pay, partially offset by approximately $39 million related to the ERC recorded by our managers. We also recorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, which has been excluded from the wage and benefit discussions below. Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe decline in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees predominantly are due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as follows:\nRooms. Rooms expenses decreased $511 million, or 58.5%, during 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses and 66% of our 2019 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage. F&B expenses decreased $700 million, or 62.5%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 74% of our 2020 F&B expenses and 70% of our 2019 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses. Other departmental and support expenses decreased $609 million, or 47.0%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses and 41% of our 2019 other departmental and support expenses.\nManagement fees. Total management fees decreased $200 million, or 83.7%, in 2020. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased $119 million, or 72.1%, compared to 2019. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $91 million, as we did not pay incentive management fees during 2020.\nOther property-level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses decreased $53 million, or 14.5%, in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2020 and 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $11 million, or 1.6%, to $665 million in 2020, due to impairment expense that was recorded in 2019.\nOther Income and Expenses\nCorporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. In 2020, corporate and other expenses declined by approximately 17% compared to 2019, as a result of reduced compensation, travel and other overhead. In 2019, corporate and other expenses include costs associated with a significant transformation of our corporate information systems platform, the implementation of which was completed in the second quarter of 2019.\nGain on insurance and business interruption settlements. In 2019, we received $27 million of property insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma, that occurred in 2017, resulting in a gain of $4 million.\nInterest income. Interest income decreased $24 million, or 75.0%, in 2020 due to a decline in interest rates.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $28 million, or 12.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting the benefits from refinancing activities in 2019 and 2020 as well as a decline in floating interest rates, which was partially offset by increased principal balances outstanding due to the credit facility draw. Interest expense for 2020 also reflects less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the Series C senior notes compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2019 on the Series Z and Series B senior notes. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash interest expense(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash incremental interest expense (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash debt extinguishment costs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash debt extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Total cash interest expense paid was $183 million and $219 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes an increase (decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $(2) million and $9 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n (2) Incremental interest expense reflects the cash interest expense for refinanced debt subsequent to the issuance of the new financing and prior to the repayment of the refinanced debt. \nOther gains/(losses).

In 2020, we recorded a loss of $30 million related to our unconsolidated investments. This included a $14 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, in addition to operating losses incurred by our investments. In 2019, we recorded earnings of $14 million from our unconsolidated investments.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes. We lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, such domestic net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. Any domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income. We expect to generate additional net operating losses from our TRS in 2021 and we will evaluate whether or not to record an income tax benefit for all or a portion of such net operating loss at that time. The 2019 income tax provision of $30 million primarily related to hotel operations at our TRS. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7. Income Taxes\u201d for a discussion of our income taxes.\nHotel RevPAR Overview\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. See All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics\u201d for a complete description of our methodology. We also discuss our Hotel RevPAR results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\n2020 Compared to 2019\nHotel Operating Data by Location.\nThe following

The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nOverview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We were able to take further steps in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.\nUnder the current challenging operating environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by drawing on our credit facility, working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotel, reducing corporate level expenses, suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases and deferring certain capital expenditures projects to future years. These actions contributed to lowering our cash used in operating activities each quarter following the beginning of the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund negative operations at our hotels, corporate expenses and reduced levels of capital expenditures. However, we also are well positioned to execute acquisitions to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise.\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in operating cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures programs. We may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2019 to 2020 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflects our actions to preserve financial liquidity:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash shown on the statements of cash flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (558\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net draws (repayments) on credit facility revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuances of senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase/redemption of senior notes, including extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (485\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (700\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Host Inc.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock repurchases and dividends on common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (467\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Host L.P.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchases of common OP units and distributions on common OP units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (470\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,112\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Requirements. We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. Our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2021 are approximately $32 million. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. Our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 91 years, while other operating obligations are generally short term in nature. We have no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $375 million to $475 million in 2021, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As part of our COVID-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend currently is suspended and we are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP Units under the terms of our credit facility amendment as discussed below. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees.\nCapital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2,335 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $139 million in our FF&E escrow reserve. We have substantially utilized the $1.5 billion revolver under our credit facility to increase our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt payments, operating and corporate costs, primarily with our existing cash reserves due to the negative operating cash from operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2020 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if our hotel operations remain at current negative operating levels.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. Following the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. However, we currently are below the interest coverage ratio required under our senior notes indentures to incur additional debt and, while not an event of default, we will be unable to incur additional debt while we remain below the required covenant level.\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2021, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.\nIn February 2017, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Host Inc. common stock, and on August 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Under the terms of our credit facility amendment in 2020, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash. In 2020, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, draws on our credit facility revolver and dispositions. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, repurchases of common stock and distributions to equity holders. We do not anticipate significant cash from operations in 2021 and we are restricted from issuing debt under the covenants of our senior notes indenture. However, we have significant available cash and also have access to stock issuances and property dispositions as alternative sources of cash. Primary uses of cash are expected to include continued funding of operating shortfalls at our properties, interest and other corporate expenses and capital expenditures. Subject to market conditions, other uses of cash may include property acquisitions or other investments.\nCash Provided by/Used in Operations. Our net cash used in operations for 2020 was $307 million compared to cash provided by operations in 2019 of $1,250 million due primarily to the decline in operations at our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties. In the first quarter of 2020, our portfolio provided cash from operations due to positive operating results in January and February. However, beginning with the second quarter, we experienced significant cash outflows from operating activities which continued through the second half of the year. However, net cash used in operations did decrease in each sequential quarter as a result of reducing operating costs at our hotels and the slightly improving levels of operations. The following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2020:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (172\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $195 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2020 compared to $58 million provided in 2019. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures in 2020, compared to $558 million in 2019.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,231 million for 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,315 million in 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the issuance of $750 million of 3.5% Series I senior notes and a draw on the credit facility, while 2019 included the issuance of $650 million of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 included the repayment of the Series C senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series I senior notes, and the redemption of preferred OP units and cash used in 2019 included the repayment of senior notes. While cash used in 2020 and 2019 both included stock repurchases and dividend payments, payments in 2020 for these items were $638 million lower compared to 2019, as we suspended dividends and repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table summarizes significant issuances, net of deferred financing costs and issuance discounts, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> Transaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description of Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Issuances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August - September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Issuance of $750 million 3.5% Series I senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March - December\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net draw on the revolver portion of the credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Proceeds from the issuance of $650 million 33\u20448% Series H senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total issuances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents significant debt repayments, including prepayment premiums, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description of Transaction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt Repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repayment of $86 million 4.75% Series C senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (94\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> August\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Repayment of $364 million 4.75% Series C senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (390\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of preferred OP units of Host LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of $300 million of 6% Series Z senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Redemption of $350 million of 51\u20444% Series B senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (377\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net repayment on the revolver portion of credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (56\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total cash repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity/Capital Transactions.

On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes. The proceeds were used to make a tender offer for our Series C senior notes and to improve our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Series I senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the September 15, 2030 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series I senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2020 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.'s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.\nThe following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Covenant Requirement\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unencumbered assets test\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 150%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total indebtedness to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Secured indebtedness to total assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 40%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.2\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.5x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are in compliance with certain of the financial ratios applicable to our senior notes as of December 31, 2020, but we fell below the 1.5x requirement for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio starting as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 and, as a result, while not in default, we will not be able to incur additional debt while the ratio remains below this requirement. We expect to continue to be below the 1.5x interest coverage ratio and hence will be unable to incur additional debt until operations substantially improve from current levels.\nCredit Facility. On August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity, other than those required during the Covenant Relief Period as set forth below. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees. Similar to our senior note indentures, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments. Voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.\nFinancial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ( leverage ratio\u201d) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. Except as set forth below during the Covenant Relief Period, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt\u201d concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.\nAmendments. On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on July 1, 2020 and ending on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the Covenant Relief Period\u201d). The existing financial maintenance covenants are reinstated for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, except that after the reinstatement instead of using the prior four calendar quarters' results in the calculations, only results for the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter are used during a phase in period. In addition, for the second quarter of 2022, the only financial covenant that shall be required to be satisfied shall be a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of such quarter. For the fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period (i.e., after June 30, 2022), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the Amendments shall apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the Covenant Relief\nPeriod and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter. The Amendments permit us to terminate the Covenant Relief Period at any time, subject to demonstrating satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants that otherwise would apply for the quarter ending June 30, 2022.\nThe Amendments also provide for, among other things:\n \u2022 an increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings during the Covenant Relief Period, with the rate being increased by 40 basis points to the applicable rate across the credit rating-based pricing grid determined according to our unsecured long-term debt rating; \n \u2022 the addition of a permanent LIBOR floor of 15 basis points applicable to borrowings under the revolver and the term facilities; \n \u2022 the addition of a minimum liquidity covenant, which requires a minimum liquidity level of $400,000,000 at the end of each calendar month until the end of the Covenant Relief Period (subject to potential increase in the case of any future acquisitions of hotels, but not to exceed $600 million); \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on acquisitions which provide that we may make acquisitions including (i) property exchange transactions governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) acquisitions of up to $7,500,000,000 funded by issuances of equity and (iii) acquisitions of up to $2,000,000,000 funded by existing liquidity and up to $500 million of asset sales as long as we maintain minimum total liquidity of up to $600,000,000, depending on the amount of the acquisition; we also may assume debt in acquisitions, if permitted under our senior notes indenture, provided that the debt to undepreciated real estate assets ratio shall not exceed 0.35:1.00 calculated on a pro forma basis; \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on the ability to make distributions and repurchases or redemptions, with certain exceptions, including the ability to make distributions sufficient to allow for the payment of a quarterly common cash dividend by Host Inc. of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, and annual distributions of up to $50 million for any preferred OP units which Host L.P. may issue; \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on debt incurrence such that we can incur indebtedness only if the incurrence is permitted under our senior notes indenture; \n \u2022 limitations on the ability to make stock repurchases or OP unit redemptions following the Covenant Relief Period if the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.25:1.00, subject to certain exceptions; \n \u2022 limitations on the ability to make capital expenditures from the period beginning on the effective date and ending on March 31, 2022 (or any earlier date on which the Covenant Relief Period is terminated); during this period we can fund all emergency, life safety and ordinary course maintenance capital expenditures plus $950,000,000 in other capital expenditures, such as return on investment capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 a requirement during the Covenant Relief Period to apply the net cash proceeds in excess of $350,000,000 in the aggregate from asset sales and debt issuances (but not equity issuances) as a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility; the mandatory prepayment requirements for asset sales and debt issuances are subject to various exceptions, including, among other things, (1) the net cash proceeds of asset sales in an amount of up to $750,000,000 that are used in a property exchange transaction governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) net cash proceeds up to $500 million of asset sales that are used to acquire assets unencumbered by debt, (3) the net cash proceeds of debt issuances constituting refinancing indebtedness, (4) certain indebtedness assumed in acquisitions and (5) other indebtedness up to $10,000,000. Following the issuance of the Series I Senior Notes and the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, we have maximized the $350 million net cash proceeds capacity available to Host, and therefore future excess cash proceeds will be applied in accordance with the repayment terms of the Amendments unless they fit into one of the exceptions set forth above. \nIn connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender's commitments under the revolver and term facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, for informational purposes only, as the covenants are not currently in effect under the Amendments:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Covenant Requirement\nfor all years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16.9\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum ratio of 7.25x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed charge coverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.25x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> x)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum ratio of 1.75x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x. \nInterest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. Based on Host L.P.'s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is 165 basis points.\nBorrowings under our revolver (currently $1.5 billion) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in LIBOR. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR over time. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023. There currently is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Our credit facility provides that in the event LIBOR no longer is published, we and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowing at the higher of the federal funds rate plus 1\u20442 of 1% or the prime rate\u201d announced by Bank of America, N.A.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $145 million at December 31, 2020. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends. Host Inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. After paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, Host Inc. suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the credit facility, we agreed to substantial limitations on our ability to pay common cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period as discussed above.\nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2020, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.'s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit. During the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.\nCounterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d:\n \u2022 Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations; and \n \u2022 Property and Equipment - Impairment testing. \nAll Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.\nConstant US$ and Nominal US$\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe that this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.\nSimilarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA\nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,\u201d to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:\n \u2022 Property Insurance Gains - We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets. \n \u2022 Acquisition Costs - Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. \n \u2022 Litigation Gains and Losses - We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n \u2022 Severance Expense - Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. \nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company's current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre to net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions)\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (220\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on dispositions (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (334\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash impairment expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity investment adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pro rata EBITDAre of equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to EBITDAre:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance at hotel properties (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on property insurance settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDAre (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ___________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Net income (loss), EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a gain of $59 million from the sale of land adjacent to The Phoenician hotel and a loss of $14 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates. \n (2) Reflects the sale of one hotel in 2020 and 14 hotels in 2019. \n (3) Including severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO would have been $(233) and $(184) million, respectively, for 2020. \nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT's definition of FFO included in NAREIT's Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. The adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate NAREIT FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\n \u2022 Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt - We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. \n \u2022 Acquisition Costs -Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. \n \u2022 Litigation Gains and Losses - We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n \u2022 Severance Expense - Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. \nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc.

Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\u201d above. We present all owned hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWhile management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our all owned hotel pro forma results for the periods presented herein:\nAll Owned Hotel Pro Forma Results for

This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of Host L.P.'s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.'s day-to-day management and control.\nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, we own 80 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.\nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 64%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2020 room sales. By comparison, our 2019 room sales consisted of 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, for transient business, group business and contract business. Transient business broadly represents individual business and leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand during the period April 2020 to present has primarily been driven by leisure customers. For a discussion of our customer categories, see Item 1 Business - Our Customers\u201d.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically. The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other governmental authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted.\nWe have not filed for any relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); however, several of our operators, including Hyatt and Marriott, have filed for the Employee Retention Credit ( ERC\u201d) to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under Title II of the CARES Act, as discussed below. Benefits received by our operators from the ERC related to employees at our hotels ultimately will benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels.\nIn response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have taken the following actions:\n \u2022 As of February 19, 2021, reopened 31 of the 35 hotels that had suspended operations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will maintain operations or reopen a property when it is anticipated to generate revenue greater than the incremental costs associated with staying open; \n \u2022 Average monthly occupancy (which includes the results of hotels with suspended operations) has increased during the pandemic from 6.9% in April to 17.3% in December, due primarily to increased demand in drive-to leisure markets; \n \u2022 Working with our hotel managers, we implemented portfolio-wide cost reductions, including significantly reducing staffing levels by furloughing or severing a substantial portion of the hotel workforce, reduced shared services fees, suspended food and beverage outlet operations, closed guestroom floors and meeting space, and temporarily suspended brand standards. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction of hotel operating costs across the portfolio by over 50% for the year, excluding severance, compared to 2019. We expect that certain initiatives, including modernized brand standards, \n streamlined operating departments and accelerated adoption of cost-saving technologies, may lead to long-term expense reductions over time; \n \u2022 Paid health benefits of approximately $112 million during the year for hotel employees furloughed by our managers and special pay and accrued $13 million at year-end for similar payments to be made in the first quarter of 2021. A portion of the furlough costs has been offset by ERC of approximately $39 million recorded for the year. We also recorded $65 million during the year for hotel-level severance costs; \n \u2022 Suspended contributions to our hotels' FF&E escrow accounts and suspended or deferred non-essential capital projects, which reduced full year 2020 capital expenditures by over $100 million compared to the forecast range as reported in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K; \n \u2022 Successfully amended the credit agreement governing our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and two $500 million term loans. Under the amendments, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022, with certain financial covenants modified through the third quarter of 2023; \n \u2022 Accessed the full $1.5 billion under the revolver portion of the credit facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of continued uncertainty in the global markets; \n \u2022 Suspended regular quarterly common cash dividends and stock repurchases until further notice. All future dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors; and \n \u2022 Reduced corporate expenses by approximately 16.8% for the year compared to 2019, through reduced travel, compensation and other overhead. \nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, together with the response of our hotel operators. There remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the timing for widespread availability of vaccines and, as a result, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict. We, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.\nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses. Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).\nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues:\n\nHotel operating expenses represent approximately 97% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:\n\nThe expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 59% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators. The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS:\n \u2022 hotel occupancy is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold; \n \u2022 average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) is a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold; \n \u2022 revenues per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and \n \u2022 total revenues per available room ( Total RevPAR\u201d) is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR. \nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by\nincreases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\n \u2022 NAREIT Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business. \n \u2022 All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA. All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our hotels. \n \u2022 EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre. Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate ( EBITDAre\u201d) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDAre for property insurance gains, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business ( Adjusted EBITDAre\u201d). \nIn discussing our operating results, we typically present RevPAR and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. For this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or 2020; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. We also present RevPAR separately for our consolidated domestic and foreign (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels. We provide RevPAR results in constant currency due to the consolidated hotels that we own in Canada and Brazil and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. We use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. For all other measures (net income, operating profit, EBITDA, FFO, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal US$, which is consistent with the presentation of our financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nSummary of 2020 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\n\nAll Owned Hotel Data:\n\n (1) EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and all owned hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. Beginning in 2020, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO to exclude non-ordinary course severance costs, and remove these severance costs from property level operating results, which we believe provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. Furlough costs, which are viewed as a replacement to wages, will continue to be included in these metrics. Including these severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO would have been $(233) and $(184), respectively. Including severance costs, our All Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(202) million. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. \nN/M = Not meaningful.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues declined $3,849 million, or 70.4%, compared to 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we experienced a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel beginning in mid-March 2020. An overall decline in travel as well as the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and on-going travel restrictions have significantly reduced demand at our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma RevPAR decreased 70.3% compared to 2019, on a constant US$ basis, due to a 5,260 basis point decline in occupancy to 26.0%. All owned hotel pro forma Total RevPAR decreased 69.4% for the year as food and beverage revenues also experienced significant declines due to the decline in occupancy. (see Statement of Operations Results and Trends\u201d).\nFollowing RevPAR increases in January and February 2020 across the majority of the portfolio, we experienced unprecedented occupancy declines in the second quarter, followed by modest sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters. The incremental quarterly improvement in the second half of the year was driven by increased demand in drive-to leisure markets. As a result, all owned hotel Total RevPAR in our Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Miami markets declined the least during the year, with decreases of 40.6%, 46.1% and 46.6%, respectively, due primarily to short-term leisure demand in the second half of the year. All owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Phoenix properties declined 51.1% during the year, also benefiting from leisure business, which led to strong golf revenues at two of our properties in that market, while all owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu properties declined 69.6%, with operations suspended for three of our hotels through the third quarter followed by hotel reopenings and loosening travel restrictions in the fourth quarter. Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose and New York, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines in all owned hotel Total RevPAR of 74.5% and 80.3%, respectively, due to suspension of operations for a portion of the year at several of these hotels. The largest all owned hotel Total RevPAR declines occurred in our Boston and Chicago markets, with decreases of 84.8% and 82.7%, respectively, as operations remain suspended at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Westin Chicago River North.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) declined in 2020 to (58.8)% due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit margins under GAAP also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined to (8.5)% for the year.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. decreased $1,673 million in 2020 to a loss of $741 million primarily due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a $132 million decrease in other gains/(losses), consisting primarily of lower gain on sale of assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. These results led to a diluted loss per common share for Host Inc. of $1.04. Adjusted EBITDAre, which excludes, among other items, gain on sale of assets, impairment expense and severance expense, decreased to $(168) million for the year, while Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which excludes gain on sale of assets and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, impairment and severance, decreased to $(0.17) in 2020.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\n2021 Outlook\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2021. While economic growth and business investment are expected to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, supported by further stimulus, low interest rates, and vaccine distribution, government-imposed restrictions across the U.S. remain. Many regions continue to grapple with the early 2021 surge in outbreaks and new variants of the virus, which has resulted in elevated jobless claims and slower economic activity in the first part of the year. While forecasts for 2021 remain uncertain, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real GDP of 4.9% for the year, while business investment is anticipated to increase 6.8%. Though analysts believe the unemployment rate peaked in 2020, it is anticipated to remain elevated into 2021, with an expected average of 5.8% for the year. The range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically is exceptionally wide, reflecting both the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and varying analyst assumptions surrounding infection rates, new virus variants and the timing of vaccine deployments.\nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2021, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges resulted in project delays across the U.S. A large percentage of U.S. hotels closed temporarily in 2020, and while many have begun to reopen, we anticipate that the number of permanent hotel closures will be higher than historical averages. The pandemic's outsized impact on our industry has resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between increased business investment and RevPAR growth. RevPAR recovery is anticipated to lag that of the broader U.S. economy, despite lower supply growth. Luxury and upper upscale hotels in top markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. While we have seen slightly improving trends, we anticipate that these factors will persist in 2021.\nAs a result of the significant uncertainties related to the timing of vaccine deployment, further government stimulus and related policy, and resulting broader macroeconomic trends in 2021, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slow return of corporate and group travel, as businesses likely will remain cautious. While investor optimism has grown in the early part of 2021 as analysts focus on the potential for significant pent-up leisure demand, existing corporate policies are expected to continue to constrain nonessential business transient and group travel until the country approaches herd immunity. Given the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its effect on our industry, we are not able to provide a full year forecast for RevPAR at this time. We believe that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. Accordingly, we believe the recovery in 2021 likely will be gradual and that the impact on specific markets and industries will be uneven.\nAs noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. There can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2021, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting the Brazil and Canada markets in order to focus on our domestic portfolio. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\nDispositions. We completed the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa in 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $202 million. Additionally, in transactions completed during the year, we sold a total of 38 acres of land adjacent to The Phoenician for $83 million.\nFinancing transactions. Senior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of approximately $733 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior Notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects. A portion of the proceeds were used in August 2020 to repay approximately 81% of the outstanding 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $390 million, including $26 million of prepayment costs. Additionally, the remaining $86 million of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $94 million, including a premium of approximately $8 million. This eliminated the final series of senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating, and therefore any covenants or restrictions under our non-investment grade senior notes indentures no longer are applicable.\nCredit Facility. During the year, we had a net draw of $1,483 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Additionally, in June 2020 and February 2021, we amended the terms of our credit facility, under which the quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. Following the covenant waiver period, certain financial maintenance covenants are modified through the third quarter of 2023.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. Through our transactions in 2020, we were able to lower our weighted average interest rate to 3.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2019, and extended our weighted average debt maturity to 5.0 years. We have a debt balance of $5.5 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nFor a detailed discussion, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5. Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Projects. We continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2020, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures, of which $343 million represented return on investment ( ROI\u201d) capital expenditures and $156 million represented renewal and replacement projects.\nIn collaboration with Marriott, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2018 on an initial 17 properties, now 16 properties following the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, that is expected to occur over a four-year period. We believe these investments will make these hotels more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. To accelerate this process, we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements, or approximately an average of $175 million per year, which amounts are included in the forecast range of 2021 capital expenditures reflected below. In exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, over the four years to offset expected business disruption.\nOf the 16 properties included in the program, we substantially completed the projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019 and projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020. Work is underway at seven other properties. Approximately 65% of the total estimated costs of the transformational capital program have been spent as of December 31, 2020 and, in 2021, we expect to substantially complete four additional properties, including: The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Medical Center Marriott and Orlando World Center Marriott.\nIn 2021, we also have several projects scheduled to be completed or initiated that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. These include:\n \u2022 AC Hotel Scottsdale North - using an underutilized parking lot alongside The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, we developed a 165-room select-service hotel branded as an AC by Marriott. The hotel was substantially completed in 2020 and opened in January 2021; \n \u2022 Additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort - development and construction of 19 additional two-bedroom, luxury villas at the Andaz Maui is underway and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021; \n \u2022 Expansion at The Ritz-Carlton Naples Golf Resort - development and construction of a 1.5-acre water park is underway and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021; \n \u2022 Expansions at the Orlando World Center Marriott - development and construction of a 2.3-acre waterpark and a 60,000 gross square-foot meeting space expansion is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022; and \n \u2022 The Ritz-Carlton Naples - a tower expansion and extensive guestroom renovation that will increase the number of suites at the property are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2021, paired with the redevelopment of public and meeting space, including the addition of a new pool and cabanas to begin in 2022, with all projects expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. \nFor 2021, we expect to make capital expenditures of $375 million to $475 million, including approximately $110 million to $140 million for the Marriott transformational capital program discussed above, which is expected to be nearly 85% complete by year-end 2021. We received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020 from Marriott and expect to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The total expected capital spend consists of $275 million to $325 million of ROI projects and $100 million to $150 million of renewal and replacement projects. We have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million, if required, to conserve cash.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends. On August 5, 2019, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 8.9 million common shares at an average price of $16.49 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $147 million, prior to suspending our repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. Repurchases are currently restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment.\nDuring 2020, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in the first quarter, with respect to Host Inc.'s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.2042988 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2020. As part of its response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, Host suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend commencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in July 2020.\nThere can be no assurances as to when dividends will be restored but, based on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. However, while the dividend is suspended to preserve cash and liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\n\n (1) Amounts represent total operating costs and expenses from our consolidated statements of operations, less corporate and other expenses and the gain on insurance and business interruption settlements. \nN/M = Not meaningful\nStatement of Operations Results and Trends\nThe following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\n\nThe significant decline in revenues was due predominantly to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began to significantly impact hotel operations beginning in March of 2020. After a significant decline in revenues in the second quarter, revenues gradually improved through subsequent quarters, although they remained well below historical levels. Our 2020 revenues on a quarterly basis were as follows:\n\nRooms. Total rooms revenues decreased $2,455 million, or 71.6%, in 2020. Rooms revenues in 2019 include $196 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nFood and beverage. Total F&B revenues decreased $1,221 million, or 74.1%, in 2020. F&B revenues in 2019 include $77 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nOther revenues. Total other revenues decreased $173 million, or 44.2%, in 2019. Attrition and cancelation fees increased $3 million compared to 2019. Other revenues in 2019 include $26 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):\n\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 59% of these expenses in any year. During 2020, these expenses declined 54% compared to 2019, excluding the severance expense discussed below. Included in these amounts in 2020 is $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers and special pay, partially offset by approximately $39 million related to the ERC recorded by our managers. We also recorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, which has been excluded from the wage and benefit discussions below. Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe decline in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees predominantly are due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as follows:\nRooms. Rooms expenses decreased $511 million, or 58.5%, during 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses and 66% of our 2019 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage. F&B expenses decreased $700 million, or 62.5%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 74% of our 2020 F&B expenses and 70% of our 2019 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses. Other departmental and support expenses decreased $609 million, or 47.0%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses and 41% of our 2019 other departmental and support expenses.\nManagement fees. Total management fees decreased $200 million, or 83.7%, in 2020. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased $119 million, or 72.1%, compared to 2019. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $91 million, as we did not pay incentive management fees during 2020.\nOther property-level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses decreased $53 million, or 14.5%, in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2020 and 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $11 million, or 1.6%, to $665 million in 2020, due to impairment expense that was recorded in 2019.\nOther Income and Expenses\nCorporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\n\nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. In 2020, corporate and other expenses declined by approximately 17% compared to 2019, as a result of reduced compensation, travel and other overhead. In 2019, corporate and other expenses include costs associated with a significant transformation of our corporate information systems platform, the implementation of which was completed in the second quarter of 2019.\nGain on insurance and business interruption settlements. In 2019, we received $27 million of property insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma, that occurred in 2017, resulting in a gain of $4 million.\nInterest income. Interest income decreased $24 million, or 75.0%, in 2020 due to a decline in interest rates.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $28 million, or 12.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting the benefits from refinancing activities in 2019 and 2020 as well as a decline in floating interest rates, which was partially offset by increased principal balances outstanding due to the credit facility draw. Interest expense for 2020 also reflects less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the Series C senior notes compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2019 on the Series Z and Series B senior notes. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):\n\n (1) Total cash interest expense paid was $183 million and $219 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes an increase (decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $(2) million and $9 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n (2) Incremental interest expense reflects the cash interest expense for refinanced debt subsequent to the issuance of the new financing and prior to the repayment of the refinanced debt. \nOther gains/(losses). The following table presents the gains recognized on the sale of assets and other (in millions):\n\n (1) Represents amortization of the previously deferred gain related to the land contributed to the Maui JV. \nEquity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $30 million related to our unconsolidated investments. This included a $14 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, in addition to operating losses incurred by our investments. In 2019, we recorded earnings of $14 million from our unconsolidated investments.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes. We lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, such domestic net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. Any domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income. We expect to generate additional net operating losses from our TRS in 2021 and we will evaluate whether or not to record an income tax benefit for all or a portion of such net operating loss at that time. The 2019 income tax provision of $30 million primarily related to hotel operations at our TRS. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7. Income Taxes\u201d for a discussion of our income taxes.\nHotel RevPAR Overview\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. See All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics\u201d for a complete description of our methodology. We also discuss our Hotel RevPAR results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).\n2020 Compared to 2019\nHotel Operating Data by Location.\nThe following table sets forth performance information for our hotels by geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAll Owned Hotels (pro forma) by Location in Constant US$(1)\n\n (1) For a discussion of constant US$ and nominal US$ presentation, see -All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics.\u201d \nHotel Sales by Business Mix.\nThe majority of our customers fall into three broad categories: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix results from the 79 hotels owned as of December 31, 2020.\nThe following are the results of our consolidated portfolio transient, group and contract business:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nOverview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We were able to take further steps in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.\nUnder the current challenging operating environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by drawing on our credit facility, working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotel, reducing corporate level expenses, suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases and deferring certain capital expenditures projects to future years. These actions contributed to lowering our cash used in operating activities each quarter following the beginning of the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund negative operations at our hotels, corporate expenses and reduced levels of capital expenditures. However, we also are well positioned to execute acquisitions to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise.\nDespite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in operating cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures programs. We may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2019 to 2020 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflects our actions to preserve financial liquidity:\n\nCash Requirements. We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. Our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2021 are approximately $32 million. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. Our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 91 years, while other operating obligations are generally short term in nature. We have no significant debt maturities until 2023.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $375 million to $475 million in 2021, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As part of our COVID-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend currently is suspended and we are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP Units under the terms of our credit facility amendment as discussed below. See also Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies\u201d for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees.\nCapital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2,335 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $139 million in our FF&E escrow reserve. We have substantially utilized the $1.5 billion revolver under our credit facility to increase our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt payments, operating and corporate costs, primarily with our existing cash reserves due to the negative operating cash from operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2020 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if our hotel operations remain at current negative operating levels.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. Following the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. However, we currently are below the interest coverage ratio required under our senior notes indentures to incur additional debt and, while not an event of default, we will be unable to incur additional debt while we remain below the required covenant level.\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2021, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.\nIn February 2017, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Host Inc. common stock, and on August 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Under the terms of our credit facility amendment in 2020, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash. In 2020, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, draws on our credit facility revolver and dispositions. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, repurchases of common stock and distributions to equity holders. We do not anticipate significant cash from operations in 2021 and we are restricted from issuing debt under the covenants of our senior notes indenture. However, we have significant available cash and also have access to stock issuances and property dispositions as alternative sources of cash. Primary uses of cash are expected to include continued funding of operating shortfalls at our properties, interest and other corporate expenses and capital expenditures. Subject to market conditions, other uses of cash may include property acquisitions or other investments.\nCash Provided by/Used in Operations. Our net cash used in operations for 2020 was $307 million compared to cash provided by operations in 2019 of $1,250 million due primarily to the decline in operations at our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties. In the first quarter of 2020, our portfolio provided cash from operations due to positive operating results in January and February. However, beginning with the second quarter, we experienced significant cash outflows from operating activities which continued through the second half of the year. However, net cash used in operations did decrease in each sequential quarter as a result of reducing operating costs at our hotels and the slightly improving levels of operations. The following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2020:\n\nCash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $195 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2020 compared to $58 million provided in 2019. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures in 2020, compared to $558 million in 2019. These amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $12 million, $12 million and $11 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and return of investments in affiliates from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\n\n (1) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. As a result, the acquisition above was considered an asset acquisition and we capitalized $2 million of acquisition costs in 2019, which costs are not included in the above chart. \n\n (1) Proceeds are net of transfer taxes, other sales costs and FF&E replacement funds deposited directly to the property or hotel manager by the purchaser. \n (2) In connection with the sale of a parcel of land adjacent to The Phoenician hotel, we extended a $9 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The disposition proceeds shown are net of the bridge loan. The loan was repaid in January 2021. \n (3) In connection with the sale of the Chicago Marriott Suites O'Hare, we extended a $28 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The disposition proceeds shown are net of the bridge loan. The loan was repaid in January 2020. \nCash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,231 million for 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,315 million in 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the issuance of $750 million of 3.5% Series I senior notes and a draw on the credit facility, while 2019 included the issuance of $650 million of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 included the repayment of the Series C senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series I senior notes, and the redemption of preferred OP units and cash used in 2019 included the repayment of senior notes. While cash used in 2020 and 2019 both included stock repurchases and dividend payments, payments in 2020 for these items were $638 million lower compared to 2019, as we suspended dividends and repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following table summarizes significant issuances, net of deferred financing costs and issuance discounts, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\n\nThe following table presents significant debt repayments, including prepayment premiums, that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\n\nEquity/Capital Transactions. The following table summarizes significant equity transactions that have been completed from January 1, 2019 through February 19, 2021 (in millions):\n\n (1) In connection with the dividend payments, Host L.P. made distributions of $323 million in 2020 and $630 million in 2019 to its common OP unit holders. \nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt was approximately $5.5 billion, of which 55% carried a fixed rate of interest. Total debt was comprised of the following (in millions):\n\n_________\n (1) There were no outstanding credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2019. Amount shown represents deferred financing costs related to the credit facility revolver. \nAggregate debt maturities at December 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):\n\n \nSenior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes. The proceeds were used to make a tender offer for our Series C senior notes and to improve our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Series I senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the September 15, 2030 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series I senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2020 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.'s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.'s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.\nThe following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2020:\n\nWe are in compliance with certain of the financial ratios applicable to our senior notes as of December 31, 2020, but we fell below the 1.5x requirement for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio starting as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 and, as a result, while not in default, we will not be able to incur additional debt while the ratio remains below this requirement. We expect to continue to be below the 1.5x interest coverage ratio and hence will be unable to incur additional debt until operations substantially improve from current levels.\nCredit Facility. On August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity, other than those required during the Covenant Relief Period as set forth below. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees. Similar to our senior note indentures, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments. Voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.\nFinancial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ( leverage ratio\u201d) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. Except as set forth below during the Covenant Relief Period, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt\u201d concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.\nAmendments. On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on July 1, 2020 and ending on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the Covenant Relief Period\u201d). The existing financial maintenance covenants are reinstated for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, except that after the reinstatement instead of using the prior four calendar quarters' results in the calculations, only results for the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter are used during a phase in period. In addition, for the second quarter of 2022, the only financial covenant that shall be required to be satisfied shall be a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of such quarter. For the fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period (i.e., after June 30, 2022), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the Amendments shall apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the Covenant Relief\nPeriod and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter. The Amendments permit us to terminate the Covenant Relief Period at any time, subject to demonstrating satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants that otherwise would apply for the quarter ending June 30, 2022.\nThe Amendments also provide for, among other things:\n \u2022 an increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings during the Covenant Relief Period, with the rate being increased by 40 basis points to the applicable rate across the credit rating-based pricing grid determined according to our unsecured long-term debt rating; \n \u2022 the addition of a permanent LIBOR floor of 15 basis points applicable to borrowings under the revolver and the term facilities; \n \u2022 the addition of a minimum liquidity covenant, which requires a minimum liquidity level of $400,000,000 at the end of each calendar month until the end of the Covenant Relief Period (subject to potential increase in the case of any future acquisitions of hotels, but not to exceed $600 million); \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on acquisitions which provide that we may make acquisitions including (i) property exchange transactions governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) acquisitions of up to $7,500,000,000 funded by issuances of equity and (iii) acquisitions of up to $2,000,000,000 funded by existing liquidity and up to $500 million of asset sales as long as we maintain minimum total liquidity of up to $600,000,000, depending on the amount of the acquisition; we also may assume debt in acquisitions, if permitted under our senior notes indenture, provided that the debt to undepreciated real estate assets ratio shall not exceed 0.35:1.00 calculated on a pro forma basis; \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on the ability to make distributions and repurchases or redemptions, with certain exceptions, including the ability to make distributions sufficient to allow for the payment of a quarterly common cash dividend by Host Inc. of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, and annual distributions of up to $50 million for any preferred OP units which Host L.P. may issue; \n \u2022 during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on debt incurrence such that we can incur indebtedness only if the incurrence is permitted under our senior notes indenture; \n \u2022 limitations on the ability to make stock repurchases or OP unit redemptions following the Covenant Relief Period if the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.25:1.00, subject to certain exceptions; \n \u2022 limitations on the ability to make capital expenditures from the period beginning on the effective date and ending on March 31, 2022 (or any earlier date on which the Covenant Relief Period is terminated); during this period we can fund all emergency, life safety and ordinary course maintenance capital expenditures plus $950,000,000 in other capital expenditures, such as return on investment capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 a requirement during the Covenant Relief Period to apply the net cash proceeds in excess of $350,000,000 in the aggregate from asset sales and debt issuances (but not equity issuances) as a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility; the mandatory prepayment requirements for asset sales and debt issuances are subject to various exceptions, including, among other things, (1) the net cash proceeds of asset sales in an amount of up to $750,000,000 that are used in a property exchange transaction governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) net cash proceeds up to $500 million of asset sales that are used to acquire assets unencumbered by debt, (3) the net cash proceeds of debt issuances constituting refinancing indebtedness, (4) certain indebtedness assumed in acquisitions and (5) other indebtedness up to $10,000,000. Following the issuance of the Series I Senior Notes and the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, we have maximized the $350 million net cash proceeds capacity available to Host, and therefore future excess cash proceeds will be applied in accordance with the repayment terms of the Amendments unless they fit into one of the exceptions set forth above. \nIn connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender's commitments under the revolver and term facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, for informational purposes only, as the covenants are not currently in effect under the Amendments:\n\n (1) If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x. \nInterest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on Host L.P.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. Based on Host L.P.'s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is 165 basis points.\nBorrowings under our revolver (currently $1.5 billion) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in LIBOR. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR over time. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023. There currently is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Our credit facility provides that in the event LIBOR no longer is published, we and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowing at the higher of the federal funds rate plus 1\u20442 of 1% or the prime rate\u201d announced by Bank of America, N.A.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $145 million at December 31, 2020. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends. Host Inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. After paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, Host Inc. suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.'s Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the credit facility, we agreed to substantial limitations on our ability to pay common cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period as discussed above.\nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2020, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.'s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit. During the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.\nCounterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d:\n \u2022 Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations; and \n \u2022 Property and Equipment - Impairment testing. \nAll Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.\nConstant US$ and Nominal US$\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe that this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures,\u201d which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.\nSimilarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA\nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.\nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,\u201d to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:\n \u2022 Property Insurance Gains - We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets. \n \u2022 Acquisition Costs - Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. \n \u2022 Litigation Gains and Losses - We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n \u2022 Severance Expense - Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. \nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company's current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre to net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions)\n\n (1) Net income (loss), EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a gain of $59 million from the sale of land adjacent to The Phoenician hotel and a loss of $14 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates. \n (2) Reflects the sale of one hotel in 2020 and 14 hotels in 2019. \n (3) Including severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO would have been $(233) and $(184) million, respectively, for 2020. \nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT's definition of FFO included in NAREIT's Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. The adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate NAREIT FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\n \u2022 Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt - We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. \n \u2022 Acquisition Costs -Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. \n \u2022 Litigation Gains and Losses - We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n \u2022 Severance Expense - Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. \nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc. Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share to\nNAREIT and Adjusted Funds From Operations per Diluted Share\n(in millions, except per share amount)\n\n (1-3) Refer to the corresponding footnote on the Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Host Inc. and Host L.P. \n (4) Earnings per diluted share and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive. \nAll Owned Hotel Pro Forma Property Level Operating Results\nWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\u201d above. We present all owned hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWhile management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our all owned hotel pro forma results for the periods presented herein:\nAll Owned Hotel Pro Forma Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions, except hotel statistics)\n\n\n \n (1) Profit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. GAAP operating profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations. Comparable hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above table. \n (2) Including severance costs, our All Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(202) million for 2020. \n (3) Pro forma adjustments represent the following items: (i) the elimination of results of operations of our sold hotels, which operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the addition of results for periods prior to our ownership for hotels acquired during the presented periods. For this presentation, we no longer adjust for certain items such as the results of our leased office buildings and other non-hotel revenue and expense items, and they are included in the All Owned Hotel Pro Forma results.

report:\n\n- Total revenues declined 70.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupancy rates dropped significantly starting in March 2020, leading to large declines in room revenues, food & beverage revenues, and other revenues.\n\n- Operating profit margin declined to -58.8% in 2020 from 14.6% in 2019. Net loss was $741 million compared to net income of $613 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDAre declined from $1.5 billion to -$168 million. \n\n- The company took several actions in response to COVID-19 including drawing down $1.5 billion on its credit facility, suspending dividends and buybacks, reducing operating costs, and amending debt agreements.\n\n- Hotel revenue metrics like RevPAR and Total RevPAR dropped 70% on a constant dollar basis for the owned hotel portfolio. Declines were most severe in urban markets reliant on air travel and group business. \n\n- The company has sufficient liquidity to withstand current operating losses but expects continued negative cash flow from operations until travel demand improves. Additional debt issuances are restricted due to falling below required interest coverage ratios.\n\n- Capital expenditures were reduced to $499 million in 2020, a $59 million decrease from 2019. The company can reduce 2021 capital spending by ~$150 million if needed.\n\n- The company believes travel demand will gradually recover in 2021 but significant uncertainty remains regarding the timing and pace of improvement."}
