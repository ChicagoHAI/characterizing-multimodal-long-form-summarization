MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion presents Management's analysis of the Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of operations for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K Annual Report (see Item 8 below).\nStatements contained in this report or incorporated by reference that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, including the Company's expectations, intentions, beliefs, or strategies regarding the future. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, growth rates, income, expenses, or other values which are included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date noted, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could materially differ from those in such forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those outlined previously in Item 1A.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The financial information and disclosures contained within those statements are significantly impacted by Management's estimates and judgments, which are based on historical experience and incorporate various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates under divergent conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, and have the greatest potential impact on the Company's stated results of operations. In Management's opinion, the Company's critical accounting policies deal with the following areas: the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses, as explained in detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; the valuation of impaired loans and foreclosed assets, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, especially with regard to the ability of the Company to recover deferred tax assets as discussed in the Provision for Income Taxes\u201d and Other Assets\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; and goodwill and other intangible assets, which are evaluated annually for impairment and for which we have determined that no impairment exists, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Other Assets\u201d section of this discussion and analysis. Critical accounting areas are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Company's financial statements incorporate the most recent expectations with regard to those areas.\nOverview of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nResults of Operations Summary\nThe Company recognized net income of $35.96 million in 2019 relative to $29.68 million in 2018 and $19.54 million in 2017. Net income per diluted share was $2.33 in 2019, as compared to $1.92 in 2018 and $1.36 for 2017. The Company's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.40% and 12.23%, respectively, in 2019, as compared to 1.23% and 11.37%, respectively, in 2018 and 0.93% and 8.82%, respectively, for 2017. Our financial results have been trending better for the past several years due in part to a higher volume of loans, a strong base of core deposits, and reductions in nonperforming assets. Our operating results and balance sheet have been materially impacted by a whole-bank acquisition in 2017, branch acquisitions in both 2017 and 2018, and nonrecurring items, as discussed in greater detail in the applicable sections below. Furthermore, the Company's financial performance was favorably affected by a substantially lower corporate income tax rate starting in 2018, but was negatively impacted in 2017 by a $2.71 million charge to our income tax provision as we revalued our net deferred tax asset to reflect the lower income tax rate enacted\nat the end of that year. The following is a summary of the major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet interest income improved by 5% in 2019 over 2018 and 22% in 2018 over 2017, due primarily to growth in average interest-earning assets. The increase in average earning assets in 2019 over 2018 was due primarily to a $90.0 million increase in average balance of real estate loans and a $48.1 million increase in average balances of mortgage warehouse loans, partially offset by decreases in other loan categories. The increase in real estate loans was driven primarily by organic growth in late 2018 and early 2019, but were offset by paydowns in the second half of 2019. The increase in average mortgage warehouse loans in 2019 was primarily a result of proactive pricing and marketing to mortgage lenders in the lower mortgage rate cycle in 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 over 2017 was due partly to recent acquisitions, but was largely organic, resulting from concerted business development efforts and lending opportunities inherent in expanded markets. The positive impact of average asset growth in 2019 was partially offset by a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin due to the lower rate environment in the second half of 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 as compared to 2017 was further enhanced by net interest margin expansion of 20 basis points in 2018 resulting in part from short-term interest rate increases, discount accretion on acquisition loans, and a favorable shift in our mix of interest-earning assets. Net interest income has also been impacted by nonrecurring interest items, which added $0.82 million to interest income in 2019 relative to $0.28 million in 2018 and $0.74 million in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019, as compared to $4.35 million in 2018 and a negative provision of $1.14 million in 2017. The 2019 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances, including reserves set aside for a $2.8 million loan that was placed on non-accrual status shortly before the end of the third quarter. We recorded a partial charge-off of $1.2 million on that particular loan in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2018 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances (including $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on non-accrual status in the third quarter). The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNoninterest income increased by $1.91 million, or 9%, in 2019, but fell by $0.22 million or 1%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to favorable fluctuation in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income associated with deferred compensation income, and a nonrecurring charge in 2018 as described below. The decline in 2018 occurred as gains in deposit service charges, debit card interchange income, and other fees were offset by lower income from BOLI and a $0.91 million drop in nonrecurring income including the impact of an expense amortization adjustment on our tax credit investments (reflected as an offset to income).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNoninterest expense increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The slight increase in noninterest expense in 2019 was due mostly to other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense and directors deferred compensation expense associated with the BOLI income described above. These increases were mostly offset by lower occupancy expense. The escalation of noninterest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 includes the impact of acquisitions on ongoing operating costs and a relatively large increase in group health insurance costs, partially offset by favorable swings of $1.78 million in nonrecurring acquisition costs, $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs, and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe Company recorded income tax provisions of $11.76 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2019; $9.91 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2018; and $13.64 million, or 41% of pre-tax income in 2017. As expected, the overall tax rate remained relatively stable throughout 2019 and 2018.

Total liabilities were $2.28 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.25 billion at the end of 2018, and shareholders' equity totaled $309 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $273 million at December 31, 2018. The following is a summary of key balance sheet changes during 2019.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal assets increased by $71 million, or 3%.

The increase in capital is due mostly to the addition of net income and capital from stock options exercised, net of dividends paid.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on deposits and other borrowed money. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non-customer sources such as BOLI and investment gains. The majority of the Company's noninterest expense is comprised of operating costs that facilitate offering a full range of banking services to our customers. As noted above, acquisitions have had a material impact on our operating results in recent periods, including the recognition of nonrecurring acquisition costs as well as higher revenues and ongoing overhead expense. Our results were also materially affected by the reduction in our federal income tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted at the end of 2017 and became effective at the beginning of 2018.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $97.37 million in 2019 as compared to $92.39 million in 2018 and $75.70 million in 2017. This equates to increases of 5% in 2019 and 22% in 2018. The level of net interest income we recognize in any given period depends on a combination of factors including the average volume and yield for interest-earning assets, the average volume and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the mix of products which comprise the Company's earning assets, deposits, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also impacted by the reversal of interest for loans placed on non-accrual status, and the recovery of interest on loans that had been on non-accrual and were paid off, sold or returned to accrual status.\nThe following table shows average balances for significant balance sheet categories and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with each category for each of the past three years. The table also displays calculated yields on\neach major component of the Company's investment and loan portfolios, average rates paid on each key segment of the Company's interest-bearing liabilities, and our net interest margin for the noted periods.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

partially offset by a $0.32 million rate variance. For 2018 relative to 2017, net interest income reflects a favorable variance of $15.13 million attributable to volume changes, in addition to a favorable rate variance of $1.56 million.\nThe 2019 volume variance is due mostly to increases in average balances of real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines. However, the ending balance of real estate loans ended 2019 approximately 3% lower than the balance at December 31, 2018. For 2018, the volume variance is due to an overall increase of $277 million, or 14%, in average interest-earning\nassets, resulting from the impact of acquisitions and organic growth in loans less a $30 million drop in the average balance of investments.\nThe Company's net interest margin, which is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets declined by 5 basis points to 4.2% in 2019, but increased by 20 basis points in 2018 as compared to 2017. The 2019 unfavorable rate variance is due partially to a lower rate environment in 2019, as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets to lower yielding mortgage warehouse lines and non-taxable investment securities coupled with an increase in rates paid on time deposits. The 2018 favorable rate variance is largely the result of a higher rate environment favorably impacting our earning assets more than our costs of liabilities. In 2018, our yield on average earning assets increased 35 basis points relative to an increase of 23 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Investment yields increased in both 2019 and 2018 primarily due to a continued plan to shift to higher yielding municipal bonds, as well as a limited investment portfolio restructuring which took place in the latter part of 2017. Overall loan yields increased in both 2019 and 2018. Loan yields have risen as a result of the impact of higher short-term index rates on variable-rate loans, and a relatively large volume of new fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans booked at higher interest rates. The increase in loan yields in 2019 was partially offset by a shift to lower yielding mortgage warehouse loans. In addition, the company proactively lowered rates on certain mortgage warehouse relationships during 2019 in order to increase volumes. Rates paid on non-maturity deposits were about the same for the comparative periods due to overall low deposit betas on such products. The only exception was a 5 basis point increase on money market accounts, but overall money market account interest cost of 15 basis points remained low in 2019 relative to the industry. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities went up in both 2019 and 2018 primarily because of higher rates paid on time deposits (including brokered deposits added in the last half of 2018). If the Federal Open Markets Committee of the Federal Reserve System keeps the federal funds target rate at or near its current level throughout 2020, we would expect to see lower time deposit rates in 2020 due to the relatively short duration of our time deposit portfolio. Overnight borrowings and adjustable-rate trust-preferred securities ( TRUPS\u201d) are also tied to short-term rates which began lowering in the second half of 2019, but still remained higher overall in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the year, adjustments to interest income occur due to the following adjustments: interest income recovered upon the resolution of nonperforming loans, the reversal of interest income when a loan is placed on non-accrual status, and accelerated fees or prepayment penalties recognized for early payoffs of loans. Such adjustments totaled $0.82 million in 2019, $0.28 million in 2018, and $0.74 million in 2017. Further, discount accretion on loans from whole-bank acquisitions enhanced our net interest margin by approximately four basis points in 2019, seven basis points in 2018, and five basis points in 2017.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019; $4.35 million in 2018, and a negative loan loss provision of $1.14 million in 2017. Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company sets aside an allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset account, through periodic charges to earnings which are reflected in the income statement as a provision for loan and lease losses. The provision for loan and lease losses includes adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses pursuant to our evaluation of overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for other specifically identified impaired loan balances. Two separate impaired loans impacted the provision for loan and lease losses in both 2019 and 2018. In 2019, additional reserve was booked in the third quarter 2019 for a $2.8 million loan placed on nonaccrual status resulting in a $1.2 million charge-off. The provision for 2018 includes $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2018. The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances.\nWith the loan loss provision recorded in 2019 we were able to maintain our allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that, in Management's judgment, is adequate to absorb probable loan losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as well as probable incurred losses in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable loan losses are immediately charged off against the allowance. The Company experienced net loan losses of $2.38 million in 2019, including a $1.2 million charge-off on the loan placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2019 as mentioned above. The Company experienced net loan losses of $3.64 million in 2018, including a $2.4 million loss on the above-referenced participation loan. The Company recorded net recoveries of $0.48 million on charged off balances in 2017. The loan and lease loss provision for 2019 and 2018 has been favorably impacted by the following factors: most charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve\nreplenishment; loss rates for most loan types have been declining, thus having a positive impact on general reserves required for performing loans; and, new loans booked have been underwritten using continued tighter credit standards.\nThe Company's policies for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance and determining loan amounts that should be charged off, and other detailed information with regard to changes in the allowance, are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and below under Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d The process utilized to establish an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses can result in a high degree of variability in the Company's loan loss provision, and consequently in our net earnings.\nNoninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\nThe table below sets forth the major components of the Company's noninterest revenue and operating expense for the years indicated, along

million increase, or 9%, as compared to a decline of $0.21 million, or 1%, in 2018. Total noninterest income was 1.00% of average interest-earning asset in 2019 as compared to a ratio of 0.98% in 2018 and 1.13% in 2017. The ratio declined in 2018 primarily due to a 14% increase in interest-earning assets and a slightly lower level of noninterest income due mostly to lower BOLI income.\nThe principal component of the Company's noninterest revenue, service charges on deposit accounts, increased by $0.30 million, or 2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item improved by $1.21 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. This line item is primarily driven by the volume of transaction accounts. As a percent of average transaction account balances, service charge income was 1.0% in 2019 and 2018, and was 1.1% in 2017.\nCheckcard fees consists of interchange fees from our customers' use of debit cards for electronic funds transactions. This category increased by $0.71 million, or 12%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.92 million, or 19%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily a result of growth in our deposit account base as well as increased usage of debit cards by our customers.\nOther service charges and fees declined by $0.99 million, or 19%, after increasing by $1.17 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019, as well as the increase for 2018 was due largely to two infrequent items occurring in 2018. In 2018, we had a $1.18 million write-up of our investment in Pacific Coast Bankers Bank ( PCBB\u201d) as well as a $0.16 million special dividend received pursuant to our equity investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d).\nBOLI income generally fluctuates based on the market. In 2019, BOLI income increased by $1.59 million, or 270%, over 2018, whereas such income decreased by $1.05 million, or 64%, in 2018 over 2017. BOLI income is derived from two types of policies owned by the Company, namely separate account\u201d and general account\u201d life insurance, and the year over year variances are due in large part to fluctuations in income on separate account BOLI. The Company had $8.0 million invested in separate account BOLI at December 31, 2019, which produces income that helps offset expense accruals for deferred compensation accounts the Company maintains on behalf of certain directors and senior officers. Those accounts have returns pegged to participant-directed investment allocations that can include equity, bond, or real estate indices, and are thus subject to gains or losses which often contribute to significant fluctuations in income (and associated expense accruals). Gains on separate account BOLI totaled $1.22 million in 2019 as compared to net losses of $0.38 million in 2018, and gains of $0.69 million in 2017. This resulted in a favorable variance of $1.07 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and an unfavorable variance of $1.13 million in 2018 over 2017. As noted, gains and losses on separate account BOLI are related to expense accruals or reversals associated with participant gains and losses on deferred compensation balances, thus the overall net impact on taxable income tends to be minimal. The Company's books also reflect a net cash surrender value for general account BOLI of $42.5 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $41.6 million at year-end 2018. General account BOLI produces income that is used to help offset expenses associated with executive salary continuation plans, director retirement plans and other employee benefits. Interest credit rates on general account BOLI do not change frequently so the income has typically been fairly consistent with $0.97 million, $0.97 million and $0.95 million of general account BOLI income recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company recognized a $0.20 million loss in 2019, as compared to a nominal gain in 2018 and a $0.50 million gain in 2017. The loss in 2019 was taken in order to sell several small balance and low-yielding bonds in order to replace them with fewer higher-yielding bonds. The earnback of the transaction was less than a year.\nLoss on tax credit investment reflects pass-through expenses associated with our investments in low-income housing tax credit funds and other limited partnerships. Those expenses, which are netted out of revenue, decreased by $0.48 million, or 19%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In 2018 as compared to 2017, these expenses increased by $1.60 million, or 166%. The largest contribution to the favorable variance in 2019, as well as the unfavorable variance in 2018 came from a $0.91 million adjustment to accelerate expense amortization on our tax credit investments, to ensure that the book value of each investment does not exceed its projected remaining tax benefits. The remainder of the annual variances primarily relate to expense amortization for newer investments, as well as a gain of $0.32 million realized in 2017 from the dissolution of one of our earliest tax credit investment funds.\nTotal operating expense, or noninterest expense, increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. Although overall noninterest expense did not fluctuate significantly from 2019 to 2018, several line items fluctuated with the largest single item being deposit service costs of $2.55 million. This increase was mostly offset by several smaller changes in other line items. The increase for 2018 as compared to 2017 is due primarily to a full year of operating costs associated with the Ojai whole-bank acquisition and a partial year of costs for the Lompoc branch acquisition, offset in part by favorable swings of $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income). Noninterest expense as a percent of average interest-earning assets trended down each year. This ratio was 3.0% in 2019, 3.2% in 2018 and 3.4% in 2017.\nThe largest component of noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits, was down $0.16 million, or 0.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item was up by $4.63 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. Salary expense declined in 2019 as compared to 2018 in part due to selective staff reductions even though there was some increase to deferred compensation expenses as well as the normal annual salary increases. Personnel costs increased in 2018 due to a full year of costs for employees retained subsequent to our acquisitions in 2017 and offices opened in 2017, staffing costs for the Lompoc branch acquired in 2018, salary adjustments in the normal course of business, and an increase of $0.59 million, or 23%, in group health insurance costs. Components of compensation expense that can experience significant variability and are typically difficult to predict include salaries associated with successful loan originations, which are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidelines on the recognition and measurement of non-refundable fees and origination costs for lending activities, and accruals associated with employee deferred compensation plans. Loan origination salaries that were deferred from current expense for recognition over the life of related loans totaled $3.68 million in 2019, $4.17 million in 2018, and $3.85 million for 2017. Employee deferred compensation expense accruals totaled only $0.23 million in 2019, an increase of $0.22 million from 2018. Such deferred compensation expenses was $0.22 million in 2017. As noted above in our discussion of BOLI income, employee deferred compensation plan accruals are related to separate account BOLI income and losses, as are directors deferred compensation accruals that are included in other professional services,\u201d and the net income impact of all income/expense accruals related to deferred compensation is usually minimal. Salaries and benefits were 51.0% of total operating expense in 2019, relative to 51.6% in 2018 and 48.1% in 2017. The number of full-time equivalent staff employed by the Company totaled 513 at the end of 2019, as compared to 541 at December 31, 2018 and 560 at December 31, 2017. The reductions each year came from efficiency initiatives implemented toward the end of the 2018 which continued throughout 2019.\nTotal rent and occupancy expense, including furniture and equipment costs, decreased by $0.45 million, or 4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.70 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The decline in 2019 was primarily due to lower depreciation expenses and lower maintenance/repair costs in 2019. The increase for 2018 includes the impact of the acquisition and de novo branch offices in 2017 and 2018, and was also due in part to an accrual adjustment that inflated rent expense in 2017.\nAdvertising and promotion costs decreased by 7% to $2.57 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.23 million, or 9%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2018 was mainly the result of marketing efforts targeting our expanded geography, and other promotional expenses associated with opening new branches.\nData processing costs decreased by $0.45 million, or 9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.65 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower core software provider costs. The increase in 2018 is primarily from additional core processing costs and other software costs associated with Bank expansion.\nDeposit services costs increased by $2.55 million, or 47%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.99 million, or 22%, in 2018 over 2017. In 2019, approximately $1.5 million of costs associated with statement printing costs that were previously recorded in Other Operations Expenses and Stationary & Supplies Expense were reclassified to Data Processing costs. The purpose of the reclassification was to better track the costs associated with producing paper statements for our customers so that we could better track progress against our strategy to lower such costs. Deposit costs were further impacted by increases in debit card processing and ATM network costs due to higher activity levels. Most of the increase in 2018 for deposit costs was the result of ongoing expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nLoan services costs are comprised of loan processing costs, and net costs associated with foreclosed assets. Loan processing costs, which include expenses for property appraisals and inspections, loan collections, demand and foreclosure activities, loan servicing, loan sales, and other miscellaneous lending costs, decreased by $0.47 million, or 41%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.11 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was due to smaller declines in almost every category of loan servicing including collections, appraisals, foreclosure costs, title, flood as a result of a dramatic reduction in the amount of residential first mortgages made by the Company. The increase in 2018 resulted from a higher level of these same costs including appraisal, inspection and credit reporting costs incidental to more robust lending activity. Foreclosed assets costs are comprised of write-downs taken subsequent to reappraisals, OREO operating expense (including property taxes), and losses on the sale of foreclosed assets, net of rental income on OREO properties and gains on the sale of foreclosed assets. Those costs were just $0.04 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.74 million net gain in 2018 and costs of $0.27 million in 2017. These costs fluctuate based on market conditions of OREO relative to our holding value and the nature of the underlying property.\nThe other operating costs\u201d category includes telecommunications expense, postage, and other miscellaneous costs. Telecommunications expense increased slightly by 3% to $1.53 million in 2019, as compared to $1.48 million in 2018. Such expense was $0.17 million, or 11%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, due to focused expense reduction efforts. Postage expense increased by $0.56 million, or 56%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased by 6% in 2018 relative to 2017. The significant decline in 2019 was due mostly to a reclassification of nearly the entire annual variance to deposit services costs related to paper statements as described above. The Other\u201d category under other operating costs was up by $0.39 million, or 28%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and up by $0.32 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in both years are due mostly to higher consulting and training costs as well as higher recruiting costs in 2019.\nTotal Professional Services costs increased by $0.25 million, or 6%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as compared to a $1.69 million, or 27%, decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017. Professional Services costs consists of legal and accounting, acquisition, and other professional services costs. Legal and Accounting costs increased by $0.14 million, or 7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.40 million, or 26%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 was mostly due to increased audit and compliance costs as a result of an enhanced risk management program. The increase in 2018 was due mostly higher audit and tax costs and higher legal costs associated with collections. Acquisition costs, or one-time expenses directly attributable to our whole-bank and branch acquisitions, totaled just $0.02 million in 2019, as compared to $0.45 million in 2018 and $2.22 million in 2017. Acquisition costs are comprised primarily of termination fees for core processing contracts and certain other contracts, software conversion costs, financial advisor fees, legal costs, severance and retention amounts paid to employees of the acquired institutions, and the write-off of furniture, fixtures and equipment that were not utilized by the Company. Other professional services costs include FDIC assessments and other regulatory expenses, directors' costs, and certain insurance costs among other things. This category increased by $0.54 million, or 27%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and declined by $0.31 million, or 14%, in 2018 relative to 2017. The increase in 2019 is mostly due to a $0.85 million increase in directors' deferred compensation expense as described above under the separate account BOLI. This deferred compensation expense increase is mostly offset by higher BOLI income. In addition, FDIC and State exam assessment expenses declined by $0.33 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The decline in this category in 2018 stems from a favorable swing of $0.70 million in director's deferred compensation expense, which more than offset higher FDIC costs and corporate insurance premiums.\nStationery and supply costs decreased by $1.07 million, or 77%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a reclassification of customer paper statement expense to deposit services costs as described above. This same category increased by $0.08 million, or 6%, in 2018 over 2017, due to costs associated with Bank expansion.\nSundry and teller costs of $0.28 million in 2019; $0.40 million in 2018 and $0.60 million in 2017 primarily reflect operational losses, including debit card disputes. These costs continue to trend downward due to better technology and education.\nThe Company's tax-equivalent overhead efficiency ratio was 57.5% in 2019, 60.8% in 2018, and 65.5% in 2017. The overhead efficiency ratio represents total noninterest expense divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest and noninterest income, with the provision for loan losses and investment gains/losses excluded from the equation. The ratio trended downward due to continued efforts to control costs, as well as to higher income. Further, acquisition costs in 2017 also impacted the ratio unfavorably.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision was $11.76 million, or 24.6% of pre-tax income in 2019 as compared to $9.91 million, or 25.0% of pre-tax income in 2018, and $13.640 million, or 41.1% of pre-tax income in 2017. The tax accrual rate was approximately the same in 2019 as it was in 2018. The tax accrual rate dropped in 2018 because of a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe Company sets aside a provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The amount of that provision is determined by first applying the Company's statutory income tax rates to estimated taxable income, which is pre-tax book income adjusted for permanent differences, and then subtracting available tax credits. Permanent differences include but are not limited to tax-exempt interest income, BOLI income, and certain book expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions. The Company's investments in state, county and municipal bonds provided $4.53 million of federal tax-exempt income in 2019, $4.06 million in 2018, and $3.71 million in 2017. Moreover, in addition to life insurance proceeds of $0.50 million in 2017, net increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance added $2.18 million to tax-exempt income in 2019; $0.59 million in 2018, and $1.64 million in 2017.\nOur tax credits consist primarily of those generated by investments in low-income housing tax credit funds, and California state employment tax credits. We had a total of $4.1 million invested in low-income housing tax credit funds as of December 31, 2019 and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which are included in other assets rather than in our investment portfolio. Those investments have generated substantial tax credits over the past few years, with about $0.54 million in credits available for the 2019 tax year; $0.63 million for the 2018 tax year, and $0.71 million in 2017. The credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants, and cannot be projected with certainty. Furthermore, our capacity to utilize them will continue to depend on our ability to generate sufficient pre-tax income. We plan to invest in additional tax credit funds in the future, but if the economics of such transactions do not justify continued investments then the level of low-income housing tax credits will taper off in future years until they are substantially utilized by the end of 2028. That means that even if taxable income stayed at the same level through 2028, our tax accrual rate would gradually increase.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets totaled $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.32 million, or 3%, for the year. Assets increased in 2019 primarily due to a $40.32 million increase in investment securities and a $30.76 million, or 2% increase, in net loans and leases. Deposits were up $52.03 million, or 2%. Total capital increased by $36.26 million, or 13%. The major components of the Company's balance sheet are individually analyzed below, along with information on off-balance sheet activities and exposure.\nLoan and Lease Portfolio\nThe Company's loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets, substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the Company's financial condition.\nThe Selected Financial Data table in Item 6 above reflects the amount of loans and leases outstanding at December 31st for each year from 2019 back to 2015, net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Loan and Lease Distribution table that follows sets forth by loan type the Company's gross loans and leases outstanding, and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated. The balances for each loan type include nonperforming loans, if any, but do not reflect any deferred or unamortized loan origination, extension, or commitment fees, or deferred loan origination costs. Although not reflected in the loan totals below and not currently comprising a\nmaterial part of our lending activities, the Company also occasionally originates and sells, or participates out portions of, loans to non-affiliated investors.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan and Lease Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n74,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,941\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther construction/land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n91,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,359\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family -

This growth is due in part to acquisitions, including Coast National Bank in 2016 and Ojai Community Bank in 2017, as well as whole loan purchases and participations. Organic loan growth has also been relatively robust in recent periods, particularly with regard to commercial real estate and construction loans.\nFor 2019, gross loans were up by $31 million, or 2%, due to growth in mortgage warehouse lines, partially offset by declines in all other loan categories. Mortgage warehouse lines increased by $97.29 million, or 106%, in 2019 primarily due to a strategy to focus on volume given the short duration of these loans. This growth strategy involved providing more competitive pricing to mortgage originators coupled with a stronger emphasis on calling efforts. The largest single decline in any other category of loans during 2019 was real estate loans of $44.31 million, or 3%, mostly due to a strategic decision to significantly reduce our activity of residential mortgages. Residential mortgage loan balances declined by\napproximately $43.0 million in 2019. As a result of the declines in other loans categories including commercial real estate and commercial & industrial loans, the Company announced in early 2020 the opening of a loan production office in Northern California (Rocklin, California) and an expansion of the loan team in Southern California.\nAs demonstrated by the expansion of the lending teams, management remains focused on organic loan growth. However, no assurance can be provided with regard to future net growth in aggregate loan balances given occasional surges in prepayments and fluctuations in mortgage warehouse lending.\nLoan and Lease Maturities\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution for total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including non-accruing loans, grouped by remaining scheduled principal payments:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans and Lease Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFloating rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFixed rate:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndue after one\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndue after one\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nor less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n78,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,115,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,402,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n938,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n308,985\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAgricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,525\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n115,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,055\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage warehouse lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n189,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,933\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,252\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n136,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n242,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n225,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,157,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,762,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n980,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n403,750\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the Company's liquidity position, balance sheet repricing characteristics, and sensitivity to interest rates changes, refer to the Liquidity and Market Risk\u201d section of this discussion and analysis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company maintains commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business, as long as there are no violations of conditions established in the outstanding contractual arrangements. Unused commitments to extend credit totaled $492 million at December 31, 2019 and $782 million at December 31, 2018, although it is not likely that all of those commitments will ultimately be drawn down. The decrease in 2019 is due in part to a higher utilization of mortgage warehouse lines in 2019. Unused commitments represented approximately 28% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 45% at December 31, 2018. The Company also had undrawn letters of credit issued to customers totaling $9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Off-balance sheet obligations pose potential credit risk to the Company, and a $0.31 million reserve for unfunded commitments is reflected as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, down from $0.384 million at December 31, 2018. The effect on the Company's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will ever be used. However, the Liquidity\u201d section in this Form 10-K outlines resources available to draw upon should we be required to fund a significant portion of unused commitments.\nIn addition to unused commitments to provide credit, the Company is utilizing a $105 million letter of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank on the Company's behalf as security for certain deposits and to facilitate certain credit arrangements with the Company's customers. That letter of credit is backed by loans which are pledged to the FHLB by the Company.

NPAs were reduced by $3.2 million, or 34%, during 2018, and the decline is even more dramatic when looking further back in time. This reduction\nhas occurred in response to better economic conditions and our continuous efforts to improve credit quality. Not reflected in the period-end numbers is the addition of a $10 million purchased participation loan to nonperforming loans in August 2018. That loan was written down by a total of $2.4 million, and was ultimately transferred to OREO and sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nNonperforming loans secured by real estate comprised $5.1 million of total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million, or 41%, since December 31, 2018. This was mostly offset by a decline in Commercial & Industrial and Consumer nonperforming loans during 2019. We have no reason to believe that there will be additional material increases in nonperforming real estate or commercial loans in the near term, but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Nonperforming loan balances at December 31, 2019 include $2.6 million in TDRs and other loans that were paying as agreed, but which met the technical definition of nonperforming and were classified as such. We also had $8.4 million in loans classified as performing TDRs for which we were still accruing interest at December 31, 2019, a drop of $2.6 million, or 24%, relative to December 31, 2018. Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements provide a more comprehensive disclosure of TDR balances and activity within recent periods.\nThe balance of foreclosed assets had a carrying value of $0.80 million at December 31, 2019, comprised of 10 properties classified as OREO and two mobile homes. At the end of 2018 foreclosed assets totaled $1.1 million, consisting of 11 properties classified as OREO. All foreclosed assets are periodically evaluated and written down to their fair value less expected disposition costs, if lower than the then-current carrying value. An action plan is in place for each of our non-accruing loans and foreclosed assets and they are all being actively managed. Collection efforts are continuously pursued for all nonperforming loans, but no assurance can be provided that they will be resolved in a timely manner or that nonperforming balances will not increase.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset, is established through a provision for loan and lease losses. It is maintained at a level that is considered adequate to absorb probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans, as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance; recoveries are generally recorded only when sufficient cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements provides a more comprehensive discussion of the accounting guidance we conform to and the methodology we use to determine an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe Company's allowance for loan and lease losses was $9.9 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019, relative to $9.8 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance resulted from the addition of a $2.55 million loan loss provision in 2019, less $2.38 million in net loan charge-offs. Reserves were established for losses inherent in incremental loan balances and unanticipated charge-offs in 2019. The net increase in the allowance might have been even larger if not for the following circumstances: many charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve replenishment; all acquired loans were booked at their fair values, and thus did not initially require a loan loss allowance; and loan loss rates have been declining, having a positive impact on general reserves established for performing loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was 173.0% at December 31, 2019, relative to 189.1% at December 31, 2018, and 228.2% at December 31, 2017. As described above, a separate allowance of $0.31 million for potential losses inherent in unused commitments is included in other liabilities at December 31, 2019.\nThe table that follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of and for the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalances:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage gross loans and leases outstanding during period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,753,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,625,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,318,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,153,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,027,983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross loans and leases held for investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,762,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,731,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,557,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,262,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,132,856\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,248\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision charged to expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther construction/land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family -

Furthermore, fluctuations in credit quality, changes in economic conditions, updated accounting or regulatory requirements, and/or other factors could induce us to augment or reduce the allowance. The Company adopted the current expected credit losses methodology on January 1, 2020. Initial estimates indicate that our allowance for loan and lease losses will increase by $12 million relative to current levels however the exact impact has not been definitively determined at this time.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments can at any given time consist of debt securities and marketable equity securities (together, the investment portfolio\u201d), investments in the time deposits of other banks, surplus interest-earning balances in our Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) account, and overnight fed funds sold. Surplus FRB balances and fed funds sold to correspondent banks typically represent the temporary investment of excess liquidity. The Company's investments serve several purposes: 1) they provide liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; 2) they provide a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits, bankruptcy deposits and certain borrowed funds which require collateral; 3) they constitute a large base of assets with maturity and interest rate characteristics that can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio, to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Company; 4) they are another interest-earning option for surplus funds when loan demand is light; and 5) they can provide partially tax exempt income. Aggregate investments totaled $615 million, or 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019, as compare to $562 million, or 22% of total assets at December 31, 2018.\nWe had no fed funds sold at the end of the reporting periods, and interest-bearing balances held primarily in our Federal Reserve Bank account totaled $15 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $2 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's investment securities portfolio had a book balance of $601 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $560 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting a net increase of $41 million for 2019. The Company carries investments at their fair market values. We currently have the intent and ability to hold our investment securities to maturity, but the securities are all marketable and are classified as available for sale\u201d to allow maximum flexibility with regard to interest rate risk and liquidity management. The expected average life for bonds in our investment portfolio was 4.4 years and their average effective duration was 3.2 years at December 31, 2019, as compared to an expected average life of 4.1 years and an average effective duration of 3.3 years at year-end 2018.\nThe following Investment Portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for each primary category of investment securities for the past three years:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment Portfolio-Available for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,326\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n398,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n414,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n399,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n393,802\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n181,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n188,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n143,201\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n592,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n600,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n569,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n560,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n561,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n558,329\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio, or the amount by which aggregate fair market values exceeded the amortized cost, was $8.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to a net loss of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.9 million. The change was caused by lower market interest rates on fixed-rate bond values. The balance of U.S. Government agency securities in our portfolio declined by $3.1 million, or 20%, during 2019 due primarily to bond maturities and a strategy to change the mix of the portfolio to more heavily weight municipal bonds. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities increased by $4 million, or 1% due to prepayments not being reinvested. Municipal bond balances increased by $47.7 million, or 34%. Municipal bonds purchased in recent periods have strong underlying ratings, and all municipal bonds in our portfolio undergo a detailed quarterly review for potential impairment.\nInvestment securities that were pledged as collateral for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law totaled $235 million at December 31, 2019 and $217 million at December 31, 2018, leaving $366 million in unpledged debt securities at December 31, 2019 and $343 million at December 31, 2018. Securities that were pledged in excess of actual pledging needs and were thus available for liquidity purposes, if needed, totaled $71 million at December 31, 2019 and $9 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe table below groups the Company's investment securities by their remaining time to maturity as of December 31, 2019, and provides weighted average yields for each segment. Since the actual timing of principal payments may differ from contractual maturities when obligors have the right to prepay principal, maturities for mortgage-backed securities (including collateralized mortgage obligations) were determined by incorporating expected prepayments.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaturity and Yield of Available for Sale Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWithin\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter One\nBut Within\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter Five Years\nBut Within\nTen Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\nTen Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.35% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.16% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.46% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.15% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n344,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.62% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.50% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.63% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.42% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.58% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n141,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.50% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n188,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.59% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n361,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n141,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n600,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Due from Banks\nInterest-earning cash balances were discussed above in the Investments\u201d section, but the Company also maintains a certain level of cash on hand in the normal course of business as well as non-earning deposits at other financial institutions. Our balance of cash and due from banks depends on the timing of collection of outstanding cash items (checks), the amount of cash held at our branches and our reserve requirement, among other things, and is subject to significant fluctuations in the normal course of business. While cash flows are normally predictable within limits, those limits are fairly broad and the Company manages its short-term cash position through the utilization of overnight loans to, and borrowings from, correspondent banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Should a large short\u201d overnight position persist for any length of time, the Company typically raises money through focused retail deposit\ngathering efforts or by adding brokered time deposits. If a long\u201d position is prevalent, we will let brokered deposits or other wholesale borrowings roll off as they mature, or we might invest excess liquidity into longer-term, higher-yielding bonds. The Company's balance of noninterest earning cash and balances due from correspondent banks totaled $66 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2019, and $72 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The average balance of non-earning cash and due from banks, which can be used to determine trends, was $61 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated on our books at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The cost of furniture and equipment is expensed as depreciation over the estimated useful life of the related assets, and leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nThe following premises and equipment table reflects the original cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and net book value of fixed assets by major category, for the years noted:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

book value of the Company's premises and equipment was 1.1% of total assets at December 31, 2019, relative to 1.2% at December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization included in occupancy and equipment expense totaled $2.8 million in 2019 and $3.0 million in 2018.\nOther Assets\nGoodwill totaled $27.4 million at December 31, 2019, unchanged for the year and other intangible assets were $5.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 17%, as a result of amortization expense recorded on core deposit intangibles. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated annually for potential impairment following FASB guidelines, and based on those analytics Management has determined that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies increased to $50.5 million at December 31, 2019 from $48.2 million at December 31, 2018, due to the addition of BOLI income to net cash surrender values. Refer to the Noninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\u201d section above for a more detailed discussion of BOLI and the income it generates.\nThe remainder of other assets consists primarily of operating leases upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (Topic 842) in 2019, accrued interest receivable, deferred taxes, investments in bank stocks, other real estate owned, prepaid assets, investments in low income housing credits, and other miscellaneous assets. The total operating lease right-of-use asset recorded on the books is $9.9 million less accumulated amortization of $1.6 million. The bank stocks include Pacific Coast Bankers Bank stock and restricted stock related to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco stock held in conjunction with our FHLB borrowings, and is not deemed to be marketable or liquid. Our net\ndeferred tax asset is evaluated as of every reporting date pursuant to FASB guidance, and we have determined that no impairment exists.\nDeposits\nDeposits represent another key balance sheet category impacting the Company's net interest margin and profitability metrics. Deposits provide liquidity to fund growth in earning assets, and the Company's net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits is concentrated in less volatile and typically less costly non-maturity deposits such as demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and money market demand accounts. Information concerning average balances and rates paid by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the Distribution, Rate, and Yield table located in the previous section under

million, or 2%, in 2019 and $128 million, or 6%, during 2018. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to organic growth. The increase in 2018 is due to acquired Lompoc branch deposits totaling $34 million at December 31, 2018, the addition of $50 million in wholesale brokered deposits, and growth in customer time deposits. Customer time deposits increased by $86 million, or 23%, due primarily to a marketing campaign targeting those deposits in the fourth quarter of 2018, but the increase also includes about $7 million in time deposits in the acquired Lompoc branch at the end of the year.\nNon-interest bearing demand deposit balances were up $28 million, or 4%, and NOW accounts increased by $24 million, or 6% in 2019. Overall non-maturity deposits increased by $48 million, or 3%, to $1.65 billion at December 31, 2019.\nManagement is of the opinion that a relatively high level of core customer deposits is one of the Company's key strengths, and we continue to strive for core deposit retention and growth. Our deposit-targeted promotions are still favorably impacting growth in the number of accounts and it is expected that balances in these accounts will grow over time consistent with our past experience, although given the current highly competitive market for deposits no assurance can be provided with regard to future core deposit increases.\nThe scheduled maturity distribution of the Company's time deposits at the end of 2019 was as follows:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree\nmonths or\nless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree to\nsix months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSix to\ntwelve\nmonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to\nthree\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver\nthree\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime certificates of deposit < $100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n131,247\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther time deposits \u2265 $100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n273,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n383,115\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n360,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n514,362\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Borrowings\nThe Company's non-deposit borrowings may, at any given time, include fed funds purchased from correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, advances from the FRB, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and/or junior subordinated debentures. The Company uses short-term FHLB advances and fed funds purchased on uncommitted lines to support liquidity needs created by seasonal deposit flows, to temporarily satisfy funding needs from increased loan demand, and for other short-term purposes. The FHLB line is committed, but the amount of available credit depends on the level of pledged collateral.\nTotal non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities were down by $27 million, or 25%, in 2019, due to decreases in FHLB advances, partially offset by increases in customer repurchase agreements. Non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities increased by $43 million, or 66%, in 2018, due to increases in FHLB borrowings and customer repurchase agreements. The Company had $20 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2019, as compared to $56 million in overnight FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018. There were no overnight federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks or advances from the FRB on our books at December 31, 2019 or 2018. Repurchase agreements totaled over $26 million at year-end 2019 relative to a balance of $16 million at year-end 2018. Repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts\u201d, where commercial deposit balances above a specified threshold are transferred at the close of each business day into non-deposit accounts secured by investment securities. The Company had junior subordinated debentures totaling $34.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $34.8 million December 31, 2018, in the form of long-term borrowings from trust subsidiaries formed specifically to issue trust preferred securities. The small increase resulted from the amortization of discount on junior subordinated debentures that were part of our acquisition of Coast Bancorp in 2016.\nThe details of the Company's short-term borrowings are presented in the table below, for the years noted:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,150\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,514\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,409\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFed funds purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.32% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.60% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,900\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,074\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.06% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.82% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Noninterest Bearing Liabilities\nOther liabilities are principally comprised of accrued interest payable, other accrued but unpaid expenses, and certain clearing amounts. The Company's balance of other liabilities increased by $10 million, or 37%, during 2019 due to the booking of an operating lease liability as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nCapital Resources\nThe Company had total shareholders' equity of $309.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $273.0 million at December 31, 2018. The increase of $36.3 million, or 13%, is due to $36.0 million in net income and approximately $1.5 million in additional capital related to stock options, a $12.6 million increase in our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of $11.3 million in dividends paid and $2.5 million in stock repurchased. We maintained a very strong capital position throughout the recession and in the ensuing years, and our capital remains at relatively high levels in comparison to many of our peer banks.\nThe Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, including risk-based capital and leverage ratios that are calculated separately for the Company and the Bank. Management reviews these capital measurements on a quarterly basis and takes appropriate action to help ensure that they meet or surpass established internal and external guidelines. As permitted by the regulators for financial institutions that are not deemed to be advanced approaches\u201d institutions, the Company has elected to opt out of the Basel III requirement to include accumulated other comprehensive income in risk-based capital.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios at the dates indicated:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSierra Bancorp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.27% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.61% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.98% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.38% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.89% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Adjusted Average Assets (\"Leverage Ratio\")\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.91% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.49% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBank of the Sierra\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.75% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.25% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.75% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.25% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.25% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.77% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Adjusted Average Assets (\"Leverage Ratio\")\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.73% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.39% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of 2019 the Company and the Bank were both classified as well capitalized,\u201d the highest rating of the categories defined under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, and our regulatory capital ratios remained above the median for peer financial institutions. We do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the Company or the Bank to be less than well capitalized, although no assurance can be given that this will not occur. A more detailed table of regulatory capital ratios, which includes the capital amounts and ratios required to qualify as well capitalized\u201d as well as minimum capital ratios, appears in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. For additional details on risk-based and leverage capital guidelines, requirements, and calculations and for a summary of changes to risk-based capital calculations which were recently approved by federal banking regulators, see Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d and Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action Provisions\u201d herein.\nThe federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio framework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized category under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying banking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent may opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework if has average consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an advance approaches banking organization.\nThe final rule became effective January 1, 2020 and banks that meet the qualifying criteria can elect to use the community bank leverage framework starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company and the Bank meet the criteria outlined in the final rule and are considering whether or not to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework.\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations and commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner. Detailed cash flow projections are reviewed by Management on a monthly basis, with various stress scenarios applied to assess our ability to meet liquidity needs under unusual or adverse conditions. Liquidity ratios are also calculated and reviewed on a regular basis. While those ratios are merely indicators and are not measures of actual liquidity, they are closely monitored and we are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity resources to draw upon should unexpected needs arise.\nThe Company, on occasion, experiences cash needs as the result of loan growth, deposit outflows, asset purchases or liability repayments. To meet short-term needs, we can borrow overnight funds from other financial institutions, draw advances via Federal Home Loan Bank lines of credit, or solicit brokered deposits if customer deposits are not immediately\nobtainable from local sources. Availability on lines of credit from correspondent banks and the FHLB totaled $523 million at December 31, 2019. The Company was also eligible to borrow approximately $59 million at the Federal Reserve Discount Window based on pledged assets at December 31, 2019. Furthermore, funds can be obtained by drawing down excess cash that might be available in the Company's correspondent bank deposit accounts, or by liquidating unpledged investments or other readily saleable assets. In addition, the Company can raise immediate cash for temporary needs by selling under agreement to repurchase those investments in its portfolio which are not pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2019, unpledged debt securities plus pledged securities in excess of current pledging requirements comprised $437 million of the Company's investment balances, as compared to $352 million at December 31, 2018. Other sources of potential liquidity include but are not necessarily limited to any outstanding fed funds sold and vault cash. The Company has a higher level of actual balance sheet liquidity than might otherwise be the case, since we utilize a letter of credit from the FHLB rather than investment securities for certain pledging requirements. That letter of credit, which is backed by loans pledged to the FHLB by the Company, totaled $105 million at December 31, 2019. Management is of the opinion that available investments and other potentially liquid assets, along with standby funding sources it has arranged, are more than sufficient to meet the Company's current and anticipated short-term liquidity needs.\nThe Company's net loans to assets and available investments to assets ratios were 68% and 17%, respectively, at December 31, 2019, as compared to internal policy guidelines of less than 78%\u201d and greater than 3%.\u201d Other liquidity ratios reviewed periodically by Management and the Board include net loans to total deposits and wholesale funding to total assets (including ratios and sub-limits for the various components comprising wholesale funding), which were all well within policy guidelines at December 31, 2019.\nThe holding company's primary uses of funds include operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, shareholder dividends, and stock repurchases. Its primary source of funds is dividends from the Bank, since the holding company does not conduct regular banking operations. Management anticipates that the Bank will have sufficient earnings to provide dividends to the holding company to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. Both the holding company and the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations on dividend payments, as outlined in Item 5(c) Dividends in this Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, nor does it have exposure to currency exchange rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and we have established policies and procedures to monitor and limit our earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The principal objective of interest rate risk management is to manage the financial components of the Company's balance sheet in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital under a variety of interest rate scenarios.\nTo identify areas of potential exposure to interest rate changes, we utilize commercially available modeling software to perform monthly earnings simulations and calculate the Company's market value of portfolio equity under varying interest rate scenarios. The model imports relevant information for the Company's financial instruments and incorporates Management's assumptions on pricing, duration, and optionality for anticipated new volumes. Various rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are then applied in order to calculate the expected effect of a given interest rate change on interest income, interest expense, and the value of the Company's financial instruments. The rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down), ramped (an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period), economic (based on current trends and econometric models) or stable (unchanged from current actual levels).\nIn addition to a stable rate scenario, which presumes that there are no changes in interest rates, we typically use at least six other interest rate scenarios in conducting our rolling 12-month net interest income simulations: upward shocks of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points, and downward shocks of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. Those scenarios may be supplemented, reduced in number, or otherwise adjusted as determined by Management to provide the most meaningful simulations in light of economic conditions and expectations at the time. We currently utilize an additional upward rate shock scenario of 400 basis points. Pursuant to policy guidelines, we generally attempt to limit the projected decline in net interest income relative to the stable rate scenario to no more than 5% for a 100 basis point (bp) interest rate shock, 10%\nfor a 200 bp shock, 15% for a 300 bp shock, and 20% for a 400 bp shock. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile, without factoring in any potential negative impact on spreads resulting from competitive pressures or credit quality deterioration:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImmediate Change in Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+400 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in Net Int.

In prior periods the simulations projected sizeable gains in net interest income in rising rate scenarios, but balance sheet changes such as the addition of fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans with longer reset periods, and the recent increase in interest rates have significantly diminished that effect. If there were an immediate and sustained upward adjustment of 100 basis points in interest rates, all else being equal, net interest income over the next 12 months is projected to improve by only $1.09 million, or 1.1%, relative to a stable interest rate scenario, with the favorable variance contracting very slightly as interest rates rise higher. If interest rates were to decline by 100 basis points, however, net interest income would likely be around $4.50 million lower than in a stable interest rate scenario, for a negative variance of 4.4%. The unfavorable variance increases when rates drop 200 or 300 basis points, due to the fact that certain deposit rates are already relatively low (on NOW accounts and savings accounts, for example), and will hit a natural floor of close to zero while non-floored variable-rate loan yields continue to drop. This effect is exacerbated by accelerated prepayments on fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities when rates decline, although rate floors on some of our variable-rate loans partially offset other negative pressures. While we view material interest rate reductions as unlikely in the near term, we will continue to monitor our interest rate risk profile and will apply remedial changes as deemed appropriate.\nIn addition to the net interest income simulations shown above, we run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank modeling the possibility of no balance sheet growth, the potential runoff of surge\u201d core deposits which flowed into the Bank in the most recent economic cycle, and unfavorable movement in deposit rates relative to yields on earning assets (i.e., higher deposit betas). When no balance sheet growth is incorporated and a stable interest rate environment is assumed, projected annual net interest income is about $6.4 million lower than in our standard simulation. However, the stressed simulations reveal that the Company's greatest potential pressure on net interest income would result from excessive non-maturity deposit runoff and/or unfavorable deposit rate changes in rising rate scenarios.\nThe economic value (or fair value\u201d) of financial instruments on the Company's balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. The difference between the projected fair value of the Company's financial assets and the fair value of its financial liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), and changes in EVE under different interest rate scenarios are effectively a gauge of the Company's longer-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at anticipated replacement interest rates for each account type, while the fair value of non-financial accounts is assumed to equal their book value for all rate scenarios. An economic value simulation is a static measure utilizing balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, and the measurement can change substantially over time as the Company's balance sheet evolves and interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated.\nThe change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including stated interest rates or spreads relative to current or projected market-level interest rates or spreads, the likelihood of principal prepayments, whether contractual interest rates are fixed or floating, and the average remaining time to maturity. As a general rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater the impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical patterns and Management's best estimates. Our EVE has increased in recent periods due to asset growth and higher discount rates, which result in a larger benefit assessed to non-maturity deposits. The table below shows estimated changes in the\nCompany's EVE as of December 31, 2019, under different interest rate scenarios relative to a base case of current interest rates:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImmediate Change in Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+300 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in EVE (in $000's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($94,510)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($115,378)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($91,610)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$48,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$78,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$96,382\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-17.13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-20.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-16.61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+8.74%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+14.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+17.47%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table shows that our EVE will generally deteriorate in declining rate scenarios, but should benefit from a parallel shift upward in the yield curve. The change in EVE flattens out as interest rates drop more than 200 basis points, while the rate of increase in EVE begins to taper off the higher interest rates rise. This phenomenon is caused by the relative durations of our fixed-rate assets and liabilities, combined with optionality inherent in our balance sheet. We also run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank's EVE to simulate the possibility of higher loan prepayment rates, unfavorable changes in deposit rates, and higher deposit decay rates. Model results are highly sensitive to changes in assumed decay rates for non-maturity deposits, in particular, with material unfavorable variances occurring relative to the standard simulations shown above as decay rates are increased. Furthermore, while not as extreme as the variances produced by increasing non-maturity deposit decay rates, EVE also displays a relatively high level of sensitivity to unfavorable changes in deposit rate betas in rising interest rate scenarios.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion presents Management's analysis of the Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of operations for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K Annual Report (see Item 8 below).\nStatements contained in this report or incorporated by reference that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, including the Company's expectations, intentions, beliefs, or strategies regarding the future. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, growth rates, income, expenses, or other values which are included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date noted, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could materially differ from those in such forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those outlined previously in Item 1A.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The financial information and disclosures contained within those statements are significantly impacted by Management's estimates and judgments, which are based on historical experience and incorporate various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates under divergent conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, and have the greatest potential impact on the Company's stated results of operations. In Management's opinion, the Company's critical accounting policies deal with the following areas: the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses, as explained in detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; the valuation of impaired loans and foreclosed assets, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, especially with regard to the ability of the Company to recover deferred tax assets as discussed in the Provision for Income Taxes\u201d and Other Assets\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; and goodwill and other intangible assets, which are evaluated annually for impairment and for which we have determined that no impairment exists, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Other Assets\u201d section of this discussion and analysis. Critical accounting areas are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Company's financial statements incorporate the most recent expectations with regard to those areas.\nOverview of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nResults of Operations Summary\nThe Company recognized net income of $35.96 million in 2019 relative to $29.68 million in 2018 and $19.54 million in 2017. Net income per diluted share was $2.33 in 2019, as compared to $1.92 in 2018 and $1.36 for 2017. The Company's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.40% and 12.23%, respectively, in 2019, as compared to 1.23% and 11.37%, respectively, in 2018 and 0.93% and 8.82%, respectively, for 2017. Our financial results have been trending better for the past several years due in part to a higher volume of loans, a strong base of core deposits, and reductions in nonperforming assets. Our operating results and balance sheet have been materially impacted by a whole-bank acquisition in 2017, branch acquisitions in both 2017 and 2018, and nonrecurring items, as discussed in greater detail in the applicable sections below. Furthermore, the Company's financial performance was favorably affected by a substantially lower corporate income tax rate starting in 2018, but was negatively impacted in 2017 by a $2.71 million charge to our income tax provision as we revalued our net deferred tax asset to reflect the lower income tax rate enacted\nat the end of that year. The following is a summary of the major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Net interest income improved by 5% in 2019 over 2018 and 22% in 2018 over 2017, due primarily to growth in average interest-earning assets. The increase in average earning assets in 2019 over 2018 was due primarily to a $90.0 million increase in average balance of real estate loans and a $48.1 million increase in average balances of mortgage warehouse loans, partially offset by decreases in other loan categories. The increase in real estate loans was driven primarily by organic growth in late 2018 and early 2019, but were offset by paydowns in the second half of 2019. The increase in average mortgage warehouse loans in 2019 was primarily a result of proactive pricing and marketing to mortgage lenders in the lower mortgage rate cycle in 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 over 2017 was due partly to recent acquisitions, but was largely organic, resulting from concerted business development efforts and lending opportunities inherent in expanded markets. The positive impact of average asset growth in 2019 was partially offset by a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin due to the lower rate environment in the second half of 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 as compared to 2017 was further enhanced by net interest margin expansion of 20 basis points in 2018 resulting in part from short-term interest rate increases, discount accretion on acquisition loans, and a favorable shift in our mix of interest-earning assets. Net interest income has also been impacted by nonrecurring interest items, which added $0.82 million to interest income in 2019 relative to $0.28 million in 2018 and $0.74 million in 2017. \n \u00b7 We recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019, as compared to $4.35 million in 2018 and a negative provision of $1.14 million in 2017. The 2019 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances, including reserves set aside for a $2.8 million loan that was placed on non-accrual status shortly before the end of the third quarter. We recorded a partial charge-off of $1.2 million on that particular loan in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2018 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances (including $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on non-accrual status in the third quarter). The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income increased by $1.91 million, or 9%, in 2019, but fell by $0.22 million or 1%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to favorable fluctuation in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income associated with deferred compensation income, and a nonrecurring charge in 2018 as described below. The decline in 2018 occurred as gains in deposit service charges, debit card interchange income, and other fees were offset by lower income from BOLI and a $0.91 million drop in nonrecurring income including the impact of an expense amortization adjustment on our tax credit investments (reflected as an offset to income). \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The slight increase in noninterest expense in 2019 was due mostly to other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense and directors deferred compensation expense associated with the BOLI income described above. These increases were mostly offset by lower occupancy expense. The escalation of noninterest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 includes the impact of acquisitions on ongoing operating costs and a relatively large increase in group health insurance costs, partially offset by favorable swings of $1.78 million in nonrecurring acquisition costs, $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs, and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income). \n \u00b7 The Company recorded income tax provisions of $11.76 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2019; $9.91 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2018; and $13.64 million, or 41% of pre-tax income in 2017. As expected, the overall tax rate remained relatively stable throughout 2019 and 2018. The lower tax rate for 2018 as compared to 2017 resulted from a reduction in our federal income tax rate starting in 2018 as \n well as a $2.71 million deferred tax asset revaluation charge in late 2017 after the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \nFinancial Condition Summary\nThe Company's assets totaled $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.52 billion at December 31, 2018. Total liabilities were $2.28 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.25 billion at the end of 2018, and shareholders' equity totaled $309 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $273 million at December 31, 2018. The following is a summary of key balance sheet changes during 2019.\n \u00b7 Total assets increased by $71 million, or 3%. The increase resulted primarily from earning asset growth including $31 million of gross loan growth and a $40 million increase in investment securities. \n \u00b7 Gross loans and leases were up $31 million, or 2%. Loan growth consisted mainly of growth in mortgage warehouse lines, partially offset by declines in other categories. \n \u00b7 Deposit balances reflect net growth of $52 million, or 2%. Deposit growth in 2019 was primarily a result of organic growth of noninterest bearing deposits of $28 million and a $14 million increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts. \n \u00b7 Total capital increased by $36 million, or 13%, ending the year with a balance of $309 million. The increase in capital is due mostly to the addition of net income and capital from stock options exercised, net of dividends paid. \nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on deposits and other borrowed money. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non-customer sources such as BOLI and investment gains. The majority of the Company's noninterest expense is comprised of operating costs that facilitate offering a full range of banking services to our customers. As noted above, acquisitions have had a material impact on our operating results in recent periods, including the recognition of nonrecurring acquisition costs as well as higher revenues and ongoing overhead expense. Our results were also materially affected by the reduction in our federal income tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted at the end of 2017 and became effective at the beginning of 2018.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $97.37 million in 2019 as compared to $92.39 million in 2018 and $75.70 million in 2017. This equates to increases of 5% in 2019 and 22% in 2018. The level of net interest income we recognize in any given period depends on a combination of factors including the average volume and yield for interest-earning assets, the average volume and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the mix of products which comprise the Company's earning assets, deposits, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also impacted by the reversal of interest for loans placed on non-accrual status, and the recovery of interest on loans that had been on non-accrual and were paid off, sold or returned to accrual status.\nThe following table shows average balances for significant balance sheet categories and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with each category for each of the past three years. The table also displays calculated yields on\neach major component of the Company's investment and loan portfolios, average rates paid on each key segment of the Company's interest-bearing liabilities, and our net interest margin for the noted periods.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

partially offset by a $0.32 million rate variance. For 2018 relative to 2017, net interest income reflects a favorable variance of $15.13 million attributable to volume changes, in addition to a favorable rate variance of $1.56 million.\nThe 2019 volume variance is due mostly to increases in average balances of real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines. However, the ending balance of real estate loans ended 2019 approximately 3% lower than the balance at December 31, 2018. For 2018, the volume variance is due to an overall increase of $277 million, or 14%, in average interest-earning\nassets, resulting from the impact of acquisitions and organic growth in loans less a $30 million drop in the average balance of investments.\nThe Company's net interest margin, which is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets declined by 5 basis points to 4.2% in 2019, but increased by 20 basis points in 2018 as compared to 2017. The 2019 unfavorable rate variance is due partially to a lower rate environment in 2019, as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets to lower yielding mortgage warehouse lines and non-taxable investment securities coupled with an increase in rates paid on time deposits. The 2018 favorable rate variance is largely the result of a higher rate environment favorably impacting our earning assets more than our costs of liabilities. In 2018, our yield on average earning assets increased 35 basis points relative to an increase of 23 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Investment yields increased in both 2019 and 2018 primarily due to a continued plan to shift to higher yielding municipal bonds, as well as a limited investment portfolio restructuring which took place in the latter part of 2017. Overall loan yields increased in both 2019 and 2018. Loan yields have risen as a result of the impact of higher short-term index rates on variable-rate loans, and a relatively large volume of new fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans booked at higher interest rates. The increase in loan yields in 2019 was partially offset by a shift to lower yielding mortgage warehouse loans. In addition, the company proactively lowered rates on certain mortgage warehouse relationships during 2019 in order to increase volumes. Rates paid on non-maturity deposits were about the same for the comparative periods due to overall low deposit betas on such products. The only exception was a 5 basis point increase on money market accounts, but overall money market account interest cost of 15 basis points remained low in 2019 relative to the industry. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities went up in both 2019 and 2018 primarily because of higher rates paid on time deposits (including brokered deposits added in the last half of 2018). If the Federal Open Markets Committee of the Federal Reserve System keeps the federal funds target rate at or near its current level throughout 2020, we would expect to see lower time deposit rates in 2020 due to the relatively short duration of our time deposit portfolio. Overnight borrowings and adjustable-rate trust-preferred securities ( TRUPS\u201d) are also tied to short-term rates which began lowering in the second half of 2019, but still remained higher overall in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the year, adjustments to interest income occur due to the following adjustments: interest income recovered upon the resolution of nonperforming loans, the reversal of interest income when a loan is placed on non-accrual status, and accelerated fees or prepayment penalties recognized for early payoffs of loans. Such adjustments totaled $0.82 million in 2019, $0.28 million in 2018, and $0.74 million in 2017. Further, discount accretion on loans from whole-bank acquisitions enhanced our net interest margin by approximately four basis points in 2019, seven basis points in 2018, and five basis points in 2017.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019; $4.35 million in 2018, and a negative loan loss provision of $1.14 million in 2017. Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company sets aside an allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset account, through periodic charges to earnings which are reflected in the income statement as a provision for loan and lease losses. The provision for loan and lease losses includes adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses pursuant to our evaluation of overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for other specifically identified impaired loan balances. Two separate impaired loans impacted the provision for loan and lease losses in both 2019 and 2018. In 2019, additional reserve was booked in the third quarter 2019 for a $2.8 million loan placed on nonaccrual status resulting in a $1.2 million charge-off. The provision for 2018 includes $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2018. The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances.\nWith the loan loss provision recorded in 2019 we were able to maintain our allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that, in Management's judgment, is adequate to absorb probable loan losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as well as probable incurred losses in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable loan losses are immediately charged off against the allowance. The Company experienced net loan losses of $2.38 million in 2019, including a $1.2 million charge-off on the loan placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2019 as mentioned above. The Company experienced net loan losses of $3.64 million in 2018, including a $2.4 million loss on the above-referenced participation loan. The Company recorded net recoveries of $0.48 million on charged off balances in 2017. The loan and lease loss provision for 2019 and 2018 has been favorably impacted by the following factors: most charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve\nreplenishment; loss rates for most loan types have been declining, thus having a positive impact on general reserves required for performing loans; and, new loans booked have been underwritten using continued tighter credit standards.\nThe Company's policies for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance and determining loan amounts that should be charged off, and other detailed information with regard to changes in the allowance, are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and below under Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d The process utilized to establish an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses can result in a high degree of variability in the Company's loan loss provision, and consequently in our net earnings.\nNoninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\nThe table below sets forth the major components of the Company's noninterest revenue and operating expense for the years indicated, along

expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and noninterest income excluding net gains (losses) from securities and bank owned life insurance income. \nNoninterest income improved in 2019 with a $1.91 million increase, or 9%, as compared to a decline of $0.21 million, or 1%, in 2018. Total noninterest income was 1.00% of average interest-earning asset in 2019 as compared to a ratio of 0.98% in 2018 and 1.13% in 2017. The ratio declined in 2018 primarily due to a 14% increase in interest-earning assets and a slightly lower level of noninterest income due mostly to lower BOLI income.\nThe principal component of the Company's noninterest revenue, service charges on deposit accounts, increased by $0.30 million, or 2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item improved by $1.21 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. This line item is primarily driven by the volume of transaction accounts. As a percent of average transaction account balances, service charge income was 1.0% in 2019 and 2018, and was 1.1% in 2017.\nCheckcard fees consists of interchange fees from our customers' use of debit cards for electronic funds transactions. This category increased by $0.71 million, or 12%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.92 million, or 19%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily a result of growth in our deposit account base as well as increased usage of debit cards by our customers.\nOther service charges and fees declined by $0.99 million, or 19%, after increasing by $1.17 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019, as well as the increase for 2018 was due largely to two infrequent items occurring in 2018. In 2018, we had a $1.18 million write-up of our investment in Pacific Coast Bankers Bank ( PCBB\u201d) as well as a $0.16 million special dividend received pursuant to our equity investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d).\nBOLI income generally fluctuates based on the market. In 2019, BOLI income increased by $1.59 million, or 270%, over 2018, whereas such income decreased by $1.05 million, or 64%, in 2018 over 2017. BOLI income is derived from two types of policies owned by the Company, namely separate account\u201d and general account\u201d life insurance, and the year over year variances are due in large part to fluctuations in income on separate account BOLI. The Company had $8.0 million invested in separate account BOLI at December 31, 2019, which produces income that helps offset expense accruals for deferred compensation accounts the Company maintains on behalf of certain directors and senior officers. Those accounts have returns pegged to participant-directed investment allocations that can include equity, bond, or real estate indices, and are thus subject to gains or losses which often contribute to significant fluctuations in income (and associated expense accruals). Gains on separate account BOLI totaled $1.22 million in 2019 as compared to net losses of $0.38 million in 2018, and gains of $0.69 million in 2017. This resulted in a favorable variance of $1.07 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and an unfavorable variance of $1.13 million in 2018 over 2017. As noted, gains and losses on separate account BOLI are related to expense accruals or reversals associated with participant gains and losses on deferred compensation balances, thus the overall net impact on taxable income tends to be minimal. The Company's books also reflect a net cash surrender value for general account BOLI of $42.5 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $41.6 million at year-end 2018. General account BOLI produces income that is used to help offset expenses associated with executive salary continuation plans, director retirement plans and other employee benefits. Interest credit rates on general account BOLI do not change frequently so the income has typically been fairly consistent with $0.97 million, $0.97 million and $0.95 million of general account BOLI income recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company recognized a $0.20 million loss in 2019, as compared to a nominal gain in 2018 and a $0.50 million gain in 2017. The loss in 2019 was taken in order to sell several small balance and low-yielding bonds in order to replace them with fewer higher-yielding bonds. The earnback of the transaction was less than a year.\nLoss on tax credit investment reflects pass-through expenses associated with our investments in low-income housing tax credit funds and other limited partnerships. Those expenses, which are netted out of revenue, decreased by $0.48 million, or 19%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In 2018 as compared to 2017, these expenses increased by $1.60 million, or 166%. The largest contribution to the favorable variance in 2019, as well as the unfavorable variance in 2018 came from a $0.91 million adjustment to accelerate expense amortization on our tax credit investments, to ensure that the book value of each investment does not exceed its projected remaining tax benefits. The remainder of the annual variances primarily relate to expense amortization for newer investments, as well as a gain of $0.32 million realized in 2017 from the dissolution of one of our earliest tax credit investment funds.\nTotal operating expense, or noninterest expense, increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. Although overall noninterest expense did not fluctuate significantly from 2019 to 2018, several line items fluctuated with the largest single item being deposit service costs of $2.55 million. This increase was mostly offset by several smaller changes in other line items. The increase for 2018 as compared to 2017 is due primarily to a full year of operating costs associated with the Ojai whole-bank acquisition and a partial year of costs for the Lompoc branch acquisition, offset in part by favorable swings of $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income). Noninterest expense as a percent of average interest-earning assets trended down each year. This ratio was 3.0% in 2019, 3.2% in 2018 and 3.4% in 2017.\nThe largest component of noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits, was down $0.16 million, or 0.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item was up by $4.63 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. Salary expense declined in 2019 as compared to 2018 in part due to selective staff reductions even though there was some increase to deferred compensation expenses as well as the normal annual salary increases. Personnel costs increased in 2018 due to a full year of costs for employees retained subsequent to our acquisitions in 2017 and offices opened in 2017, staffing costs for the Lompoc branch acquired in 2018, salary adjustments in the normal course of business, and an increase of $0.59 million, or 23%, in group health insurance costs. Components of compensation expense that can experience significant variability and are typically difficult to predict include salaries associated with successful loan originations, which are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidelines on the recognition and measurement of non-refundable fees and origination costs for lending activities, and accruals associated with employee deferred compensation plans. Loan origination salaries that were deferred from current expense for recognition over the life of related loans totaled $3.68 million in 2019, $4.17 million in 2018, and $3.85 million for 2017. Employee deferred compensation expense accruals totaled only $0.23 million in 2019, an increase of $0.22 million from 2018. Such deferred compensation expenses was $0.22 million in 2017. As noted above in our discussion of BOLI income, employee deferred compensation plan accruals are related to separate account BOLI income and losses, as are directors deferred compensation accruals that are included in other professional services,\u201d and the net income impact of all income/expense accruals related to deferred compensation is usually minimal. Salaries and benefits were 51.0% of total operating expense in 2019, relative to 51.6% in 2018 and 48.1% in 2017. The number of full-time equivalent staff employed by the Company totaled 513 at the end of 2019, as compared to 541 at December 31, 2018 and 560 at December 31, 2017. The reductions each year came from efficiency initiatives implemented toward the end of the 2018 which continued throughout 2019.\nTotal rent and occupancy expense, including furniture and equipment costs, decreased by $0.45 million, or 4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.70 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The decline in 2019 was primarily due to lower depreciation expenses and lower maintenance/repair costs in 2019. The increase for 2018 includes the impact of the acquisition and de novo branch offices in 2017 and 2018, and was also due in part to an accrual adjustment that inflated rent expense in 2017.\nAdvertising and promotion costs decreased by 7% to $2.57 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.23 million, or 9%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2018 was mainly the result of marketing efforts targeting our expanded geography, and other promotional expenses associated with opening new branches.\nData processing costs decreased by $0.45 million, or 9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.65 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower core software provider costs. The increase in 2018 is primarily from additional core processing costs and other software costs associated with Bank expansion.\nDeposit services costs increased by $2.55 million, or 47%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.99 million, or 22%, in 2018 over 2017. In 2019, approximately $1.5 million of costs associated with statement printing costs that were previously recorded in Other Operations Expenses and Stationary & Supplies Expense were reclassified to Data Processing costs. The purpose of the reclassification was to better track the costs associated with producing paper statements for our customers so that we could better track progress against our strategy to lower such costs. Deposit costs were further impacted by increases in debit card processing and ATM network costs due to higher activity levels. Most of the increase in 2018 for deposit costs was the result of ongoing expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nLoan services costs are comprised of loan processing costs, and net costs associated with foreclosed assets. Loan processing costs, which include expenses for property appraisals and inspections, loan collections, demand and foreclosure activities, loan servicing, loan sales, and other miscellaneous lending costs, decreased by $0.47 million, or 41%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.11 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was due to smaller declines in almost every category of loan servicing including collections, appraisals, foreclosure costs, title, flood as a result of a dramatic reduction in the amount of residential first mortgages made by the Company. The increase in 2018 resulted from a higher level of these same costs including appraisal, inspection and credit reporting costs incidental to more robust lending activity. Foreclosed assets costs are comprised of write-downs taken subsequent to reappraisals, OREO operating expense (including property taxes), and losses on the sale of foreclosed assets, net of rental income on OREO properties and gains on the sale of foreclosed assets. Those costs were just $0.04 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.74 million net gain in 2018 and costs of $0.27 million in 2017. These costs fluctuate based on market conditions of OREO relative to our holding value and the nature of the underlying property.\nThe other operating costs\u201d category includes telecommunications expense, postage, and other miscellaneous costs. Telecommunications expense increased slightly by 3% to $1.53 million in 2019, as compared to $1.48 million in 2018. Such expense was $0.17 million, or 11%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, due to focused expense reduction efforts. Postage expense increased by $0.56 million, or 56%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased by 6% in 2018 relative to 2017. The significant decline in 2019 was due mostly to a reclassification of nearly the entire annual variance to deposit services costs related to paper statements as described above. The Other\u201d category under other operating costs was up by $0.39 million, or 28%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and up by $0.32 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in both years are due mostly to higher consulting and training costs as well as higher recruiting costs in 2019.\nTotal Professional Services costs increased by $0.25 million, or 6%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as compared to a $1.69 million, or 27%, decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017. Professional Services costs consists of legal and accounting, acquisition, and other professional services costs. Legal and Accounting costs increased by $0.14 million, or 7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.40 million, or 26%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 was mostly due to increased audit and compliance costs as a result of an enhanced risk management program. The increase in 2018 was due mostly higher audit and tax costs and higher legal costs associated with collections. Acquisition costs, or one-time expenses directly attributable to our whole-bank and branch acquisitions, totaled just $0.02 million in 2019, as compared to $0.45 million in 2018 and $2.22 million in 2017. Acquisition costs are comprised primarily of termination fees for core processing contracts and certain other contracts, software conversion costs, financial advisor fees, legal costs, severance and retention amounts paid to employees of the acquired institutions, and the write-off of furniture, fixtures and equipment that were not utilized by the Company. Other professional services costs include FDIC assessments and other regulatory expenses, directors' costs, and certain insurance costs among other things. This category increased by $0.54 million, or 27%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and declined by $0.31 million, or 14%, in 2018 relative to 2017. The increase in 2019 is mostly due to a $0.85 million increase in directors' deferred compensation expense as described above under the separate account BOLI. This deferred compensation expense increase is mostly offset by higher BOLI income. In addition, FDIC and State exam assessment expenses declined by $0.33 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The decline in this category in 2018 stems from a favorable swing of $0.70 million in director's deferred compensation expense, which more than offset higher FDIC costs and corporate insurance premiums.\nStationery and supply costs decreased by $1.07 million, or 77%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a reclassification of customer paper statement expense to deposit services costs as described above. This same category increased by $0.08 million, or 6%, in 2018 over 2017, due to costs associated with Bank expansion.\nSundry and teller costs of $0.28 million in 2019; $0.40 million in 2018 and $0.60 million in 2017 primarily reflect operational losses, including debit card disputes. These costs continue to trend downward due to better technology and education.\nThe Company's tax-equivalent overhead efficiency ratio was 57.5% in 2019, 60.8% in 2018, and 65.5% in 2017. The overhead efficiency ratio represents total noninterest expense divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest and noninterest income, with the provision for loan losses and investment gains/losses excluded from the equation. The ratio trended downward due to continued efforts to control costs, as well as to higher income. Further, acquisition costs in 2017 also impacted the ratio unfavorably.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision was $11.76 million, or 24.6% of pre-tax income in 2019 as compared to $9.91 million, or 25.0% of pre-tax income in 2018, and $13.640 million, or 41.1% of pre-tax income in 2017. The tax accrual rate was approximately the same in 2019 as it was in 2018. The tax accrual rate dropped in 2018 because of a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe Company sets aside a provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The amount of that provision is determined by first applying the Company's statutory income tax rates to estimated taxable income, which is pre-tax book income adjusted for permanent differences, and then subtracting available tax credits. Permanent differences include but are not limited to tax-exempt interest income, BOLI income, and certain book expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions. The Company's investments in state, county and municipal bonds provided $4.53 million of federal tax-exempt income in 2019, $4.06 million in 2018, and $3.71 million in 2017. Moreover, in addition to life insurance proceeds of $0.50 million in 2017, net increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance added $2.18 million to tax-exempt income in 2019; $0.59 million in 2018, and $1.64 million in 2017.\nOur tax credits consist primarily of those generated by investments in low-income housing tax credit funds, and California state employment tax credits. We had a total of $4.1 million invested in low-income housing tax credit funds as of December 31, 2019 and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which are included in other assets rather than in our investment portfolio. Those investments have generated substantial tax credits over the past few years, with about $0.54 million in credits available for the 2019 tax year; $0.63 million for the 2018 tax year, and $0.71 million in 2017. The credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants, and cannot be projected with certainty. Furthermore, our capacity to utilize them will continue to depend on our ability to generate sufficient pre-tax income. We plan to invest in additional tax credit funds in the future, but if the economics of such transactions do not justify continued investments then the level of low-income housing tax credits will taper off in future years until they are substantially utilized by the end of 2028. That means that even if taxable income stayed at the same level through 2028, our tax accrual rate would gradually increase.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets totaled $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.32 million, or 3%, for the year. Assets increased in 2019 primarily due to a $40.32 million increase in investment securities and a $30.76 million, or 2% increase, in net loans and leases. Deposits were up $52.03 million, or 2%. Total capital increased by $36.26 million, or 13%. The major components of the Company's balance sheet are individually analyzed below, along with information on off-balance sheet activities and exposure.\nLoan and Lease Portfolio\nThe Company's loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets, substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the Company's financial condition.\nThe Selected Financial Data table in Item 6 above reflects the amount of loans and leases outstanding at December 31st for each year from 2019 back to 2015, net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Loan and Lease Distribution table that follows sets forth by loan type the Company's gross loans and leases outstanding, and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated. The balances for each loan type include nonperforming loans, if any, but do not reflect any deferred or unamortized loan origination, extension, or commitment fees, or deferred loan origination costs. Although not reflected in the loan totals below and not currently comprising a\nmaterial part of our lending activities, the Company also occasionally originates and sells, or participates out portions of, loans to non-affiliated investors.\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoan and Lease Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n74,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,941\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther construction/land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n91,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,359\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family -

This growth is due in part to acquisitions, including Coast National Bank in 2016 and Ojai Community Bank in 2017, as well as whole loan purchases and participations. Organic loan growth has also been relatively robust in recent periods, particularly with regard to commercial real estate and construction loans.\nFor 2019, gross loans were up by $31 million, or 2%, due to growth in mortgage warehouse lines, partially offset by declines in all other loan categories. Mortgage warehouse lines increased by $97.29 million, or 106%, in 2019 primarily due to a strategy to focus on volume given the short duration of these loans. This growth strategy involved providing more competitive pricing to mortgage originators coupled with a stronger emphasis on calling efforts. The largest single decline in any other category of loans during 2019 was real estate loans of $44.31 million, or 3%, mostly due to a strategic decision to significantly reduce our activity of residential mortgages. Residential mortgage loan balances declined by\napproximately $43.0 million in 2019. As a result of the declines in other loans categories including commercial real estate and commercial & industrial loans, the Company announced in early 2020 the opening of a loan production office in Northern California (Rocklin, California) and an expansion of the loan team in Southern California.\nAs demonstrated by the expansion of the lending teams, management remains focused on organic loan growth. However, no assurance can be provided with regard to future net growth in aggregate loan balances given occasional surges in prepayments and fluctuations in mortgage warehouse lending.\nLoan and Lease Maturities\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution for total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including non-accruing loans, grouped by remaining scheduled principal payments:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans and Lease Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFloating rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFixed rate:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver five\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndue after one\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndue after one\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nor less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nmonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyear\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n76,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n78,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n132,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,115,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,402,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n938,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n308,985\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAgricultural\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,525\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n115,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,055\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage warehouse lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n189,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39,933\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,252\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n136,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n242,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n225,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,157,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,762,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n980,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n403,750\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the Company's liquidity position, balance sheet repricing characteristics, and sensitivity to interest rates changes, refer to the Liquidity and Market Risk\u201d section of this discussion and analysis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company maintains commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business, as long as there are no violations of conditions established in the outstanding contractual arrangements. Unused commitments to extend credit totaled $492 million at December 31, 2019 and $782 million at December 31, 2018, although it is not likely that all of those commitments will ultimately be drawn down. The decrease in 2019 is due in part to a higher utilization of mortgage warehouse lines in 2019. Unused commitments represented approximately 28% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 45% at December 31, 2018. The Company also had undrawn letters of credit issued to customers totaling $9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Off-balance sheet obligations pose potential credit risk to the Company, and a $0.31 million reserve for unfunded commitments is reflected as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, down from $0.384 million at December 31, 2018. The effect on the Company's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will ever be used. However, the Liquidity\u201d section in this Form 10-K outlines resources available to draw upon should we be required to fund a significant portion of unused commitments.\nIn addition to unused commitments to provide credit, the Company is utilizing a $105 million letter of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank on the Company's behalf as security for certain deposits and to facilitate certain credit arrangements with the Company's customers. That letter of credit is backed by loans which are pledged to the FHLB by the Company. For more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 herein.\nContractual Obligations\nAt the end of 2019, the Company had contractual obligations for the following payments, by type and period due:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,945\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,196\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther long-term obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,685\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n48,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,826\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets ( NPAs\u201d) are comprised of loans for which the Company is no longer accruing interest, and foreclosed assets which primarily consists of OREO. If the Company grants a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty, the loan falls into the category of a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), which may be designated as either nonperforming or performing depending on the loan's accrual status.\nThe following table presents comparative data for the Company's NPAs and performing TDRs as of the dates noted:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNonperforming Assets and Performing TDRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther construction/land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family -

NPAs were reduced by $3.2 million, or 34%, during 2018, and the decline is even more dramatic when looking further back in time. This reduction\nhas occurred in response to better economic conditions and our continuous efforts to improve credit quality. Not reflected in the period-end numbers is the addition of a $10 million purchased participation loan to nonperforming loans in August 2018. That loan was written down by a total of $2.4 million, and was ultimately transferred to OREO and sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nNonperforming loans secured by real estate comprised $5.1 million of total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million, or 41%, since December 31, 2018. This was mostly offset by a decline in Commercial & Industrial and Consumer nonperforming loans during 2019. We have no reason to believe that there will be additional material increases in nonperforming real estate or commercial loans in the near term, but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Nonperforming loan balances at December 31, 2019 include $2.6 million in TDRs and other loans that were paying as agreed, but which met the technical definition of nonperforming and were classified as such. We also had $8.4 million in loans classified as performing TDRs for which we were still accruing interest at December 31, 2019, a drop of $2.6 million, or 24%, relative to December 31, 2018. Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements provide a more comprehensive disclosure of TDR balances and activity within recent periods.\nThe balance of foreclosed assets had a carrying value of $0.80 million at December 31, 2019, comprised of 10 properties classified as OREO and two mobile homes. At the end of 2018 foreclosed assets totaled $1.1 million, consisting of 11 properties classified as OREO. All foreclosed assets are periodically evaluated and written down to their fair value less expected disposition costs, if lower than the then-current carrying value. An action plan is in place for each of our non-accruing loans and foreclosed assets and they are all being actively managed. Collection efforts are continuously pursued for all nonperforming loans, but no assurance can be provided that they will be resolved in a timely manner or that nonperforming balances will not increase.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset, is established through a provision for loan and lease losses. It is maintained at a level that is considered adequate to absorb probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans, as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance; recoveries are generally recorded only when sufficient cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements provides a more comprehensive discussion of the accounting guidance we conform to and the methodology we use to determine an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe Company's allowance for loan and lease losses was $9.9 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019, relative to $9.8 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance resulted from the addition of a $2.55 million loan loss provision in 2019, less $2.38 million in net loan charge-offs. Reserves were established for losses inherent in incremental loan balances and unanticipated charge-offs in 2019. The net increase in the allowance might have been even larger if not for the following circumstances: many charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve replenishment; all acquired loans were booked at their fair values, and thus did not initially require a loan loss allowance; and loan loss rates have been declining, having a positive impact on general reserves established for performing loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was 173.0% at December 31, 2019, relative to 189.1% at December 31, 2018, and 228.2% at December 31, 2017. As described above, a separate allowance of $0.31 million for potential losses inherent in unused commitments is included in other liabilities at December 31, 2019.\nThe table that follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of and for the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalances:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage gross loans and leases outstanding during period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,753,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,625,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,318,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,153,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,027,983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross loans and leases held for investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,762,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,731,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,557,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,262,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,132,856\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n11,248\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision charged to expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCharge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family residential construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther construction/land\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1-4 family -

Our allowance for probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans was reduced by $1.18 million, or 59%, during 2019, whereas it was increased by $0.85 million, or 74%, during 2018. The allowance for probable losses inherent in non-impaired loans increased by $1.3 million, or 17%, as a result of potential local, national and global economic conditions on the loan portfolio.

The Company adopted the current expected credit losses methodology on January 1, 2020. Initial estimates indicate that our allowance for loan and lease losses will increase by $12 million relative to current levels however the exact impact has not been definitively determined at this time.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments can at any given time consist of debt securities and marketable equity securities (together, the investment portfolio\u201d), investments in the time deposits of other banks, surplus interest-earning balances in our Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) account, and overnight fed funds sold. Surplus FRB balances and fed funds sold to correspondent banks typically represent the temporary investment of excess liquidity. The Company's investments serve several purposes: 1) they provide liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; 2) they provide a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits, bankruptcy deposits and certain borrowed funds which require collateral; 3) they constitute a large base of assets with maturity and interest rate characteristics that can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio, to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Company; 4) they are another interest-earning option for surplus funds when loan demand is light; and 5) they can provide partially tax exempt income. Aggregate investments totaled $615 million, or 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019, as compare to $562 million, or 22% of total assets at December 31, 2018.\nWe had no fed funds sold at the end of the reporting periods, and interest-bearing balances held primarily in our Federal Reserve Bank account totaled $15 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $2 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's investment securities portfolio had a book balance of $601 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $560 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting a net increase of $41 million for 2019. The Company carries investments at their fair market values. We currently have the intent and ability to hold our investment securities to maturity, but the securities are all marketable and are classified as available for sale\u201d to allow maximum flexibility with regard to interest rate risk and liquidity management. The expected average life for bonds in our investment portfolio was 4.4 years and their average effective duration was 3.2 years at December 31, 2019, as compared to an expected average life of 4.1 years and an average effective duration of 3.3 years at year-end 2018.\nThe following Investment Portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for each primary category of investment securities for the past three years:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInvestment Portfolio-Available for Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFair Market\nValue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,326\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n398,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n414,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n404,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n399,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n393,802\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n181,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n188,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n140,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n143,201\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n592,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n600,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n569,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n560,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n561,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n558,329\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio, or the amount by which aggregate fair market values exceeded the amortized cost, was $8.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to a net loss of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.9 million. The change was caused by lower market interest rates on fixed-rate bond values. The balance of U.S. Government agency securities in our portfolio declined by $3.1 million, or 20%, during 2019 due primarily to bond maturities and a strategy to change the mix of the portfolio to more heavily weight municipal bonds. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities increased by $4 million, or 1% due to prepayments not being reinvested. Municipal bond balances increased by $47.7 million, or 34%. Municipal bonds purchased in recent periods have strong underlying ratings, and all municipal bonds in our portfolio undergo a detailed quarterly review for potential impairment.\nInvestment securities that were pledged as collateral for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law totaled $235 million at December 31, 2019 and $217 million at December 31, 2018, leaving $366 million in unpledged debt securities at December 31, 2019 and $343 million at December 31, 2018. Securities that were pledged in excess of actual pledging needs and were thus available for liquidity purposes, if needed, totaled $71 million at December 31, 2019 and $9 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe table below groups the Company's investment securities by their remaining time to maturity as of December 31, 2019, and provides weighted average yields for each segment. Since the actual timing of principal payments may differ from contractual maturities when obligors have the right to prepay principal, maturities for mortgage-backed securities (including collateralized mortgage obligations) were determined by incorporating expected prepayments.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaturity and Yield of Available for Sale Investment Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWithin\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter One\nBut Within\nFive Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter Five Years\nBut Within\nTen Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\nTen Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nU.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.35% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.16% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n12,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.46% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.15% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n344,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.62% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n400,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.50% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nState and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.63% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.42% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.58% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n141,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.50% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n188,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.59% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n361,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n141,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n600,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Due from Banks\nInterest-earning cash balances were discussed above in the Investments\u201d section, but the Company also maintains a certain level of cash on hand in the normal course of business as well as non-earning deposits at other financial institutions. Our balance of cash and due from banks depends on the timing of collection of outstanding cash items (checks), the amount of cash held at our branches and our reserve requirement, among other things, and is subject to significant fluctuations in the normal course of business. While cash flows are normally predictable within limits, those limits are fairly broad and the Company manages its short-term cash position through the utilization of overnight loans to, and borrowings from, correspondent banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Should a large short\u201d overnight position persist for any length of time, the Company typically raises money through focused retail deposit\ngathering efforts or by adding brokered time deposits. If a long\u201d position is prevalent, we will let brokered deposits or other wholesale borrowings roll off as they mature, or we might invest excess liquidity into longer-term, higher-yielding bonds. The Company's balance of noninterest earning cash and balances due from correspondent banks totaled $66 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2019, and $72 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The average balance of non-earning cash and due from banks, which can be used to determine trends, was $61 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated on our books at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The cost of furniture and equipment is expensed as depreciation over the estimated useful life of the related assets, and leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nThe following premises and equipment table reflects the original cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and net book value

book value of the Company's premises and equipment was 1.1% of total assets at December 31, 2019, relative to 1.2% at December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization included in occupancy and equipment expense totaled $2.8 million in 2019 and $3.0 million in 2018.\nOther Assets\nGoodwill totaled $27.4 million at December 31, 2019, unchanged for the year and other intangible assets were $5.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 17%, as a result of amortization expense recorded on core deposit intangibles. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated annually for potential impairment following FASB guidelines, and based on those analytics Management has determined that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies increased to $50.5 million at December 31, 2019 from $48.2 million at December 31, 2018, due to the addition of BOLI income to net cash surrender values. Refer to the Noninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\u201d section above for a more detailed discussion of BOLI and the income it generates.\nThe remainder of other assets consists primarily of operating leases upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (Topic 842) in 2019, accrued interest receivable, deferred taxes, investments in bank stocks, other real estate owned, prepaid assets, investments in low income housing credits, and other miscellaneous assets. The total operating lease right-of-use asset recorded on the books is $9.9 million less accumulated amortization of $1.6 million. The bank stocks include Pacific Coast Bankers Bank stock and restricted stock related to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco stock held in conjunction with our FHLB borrowings, and is not deemed to be marketable or liquid. Our net\ndeferred tax asset is evaluated as of every reporting date pursuant to FASB guidance, and we have determined that no impairment exists.\nDeposits\nDeposits represent another key balance sheet category impacting the Company's net interest margin and profitability metrics. Deposits provide liquidity to fund growth in earning assets, and the Company's net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits is concentrated in less volatile and typically less costly non-maturity deposits such as demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and money market demand accounts. Information concerning average balances and rates paid by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the Distribution, Rate, and Yield table located in the previous section under

million, or 2%, in 2019 and $128 million, or 6%, during 2018. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to organic growth. The increase in 2018 is due to acquired Lompoc branch deposits totaling $34 million at December 31, 2018, the addition of $50 million in wholesale brokered deposits, and growth in customer time deposits. Customer time deposits increased by $86 million, or 23%, due primarily to a marketing campaign targeting those deposits in the fourth quarter of 2018, but the increase also includes about $7 million in time deposits in the acquired Lompoc branch at the end of the year.\nNon-interest bearing demand deposit balances were up $28 million, or 4%, and NOW accounts increased by $24 million, or 6% in 2019. Overall non-maturity deposits increased by $48 million, or 3%, to $1.65 billion at December 31, 2019.\nManagement is of the opinion that a relatively high level of core customer deposits is one of the Company's key strengths, and we continue to strive for core deposit retention and growth. Our deposit-targeted promotions are still favorably impacting growth in the number of accounts and it is expected that balances in these accounts will grow over time consistent with our past experience, although given the current highly competitive market for deposits no assurance can be provided with regard to future core deposit increases.\nThe scheduled maturity distribution of the Company's time deposits at the end of 2019 was as follows:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeposit Maturity Distribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree\nmonths or\nless\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThree to\nsix months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSix to\ntwelve\nmonths\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne to\nthree\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOver\nthree\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTime certificates of deposit < $100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n131,247\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther time deposits \u2265 $100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n273,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n383,115\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n360,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n89,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n53,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n514,362\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Borrowings\nThe Company's non-deposit borrowings may, at any given time, include fed funds purchased from correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, advances from the FRB, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and/or junior subordinated debentures. The Company uses short-term FHLB advances and fed funds purchased on uncommitted lines to support liquidity needs created by seasonal deposit flows, to temporarily satisfy funding needs from increased loan demand, and for other short-term purposes. The FHLB line is committed, but the amount of available credit depends on the level of pledged collateral.\nTotal non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities were down by $27 million, or 25%, in 2019, due to decreases in FHLB advances, partially offset by increases in customer repurchase agreements. Non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities increased by $43 million, or 66%, in 2018, due to increases in FHLB borrowings and customer repurchase agreements. The Company had $20 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2019, as compared to $56 million in overnight FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018. There were no overnight federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks or advances from the FRB on our books at December 31, 2019 or 2018. Repurchase agreements totaled over $26 million at year-end 2019 relative to a balance of $16 million at year-end 2018. Repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts\u201d, where commercial deposit balances above a specified threshold are transferred at the close of each business day into non-deposit accounts secured by investment securities. The Company had junior subordinated debentures totaling $34.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $34.8 million December 31, 2018, in the form of long-term borrowings from trust subsidiaries formed specifically to issue trust preferred securities. The small increase resulted from the amortization of discount on junior subordinated debentures that were part of our acquisition of Coast Bancorp in 2016.\nThe details of the Company's short-term borrowings are presented in the table below, for the years noted:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase Agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n8,150\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,514\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,409\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.40% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFed funds purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.32% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.00% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.60% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBalance at December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n56,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,900\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage amount outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,074\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month end\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n55,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage interest rate for the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.06% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.82% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Noninterest Bearing Liabilities\nOther liabilities are principally comprised of accrued interest payable, other accrued but unpaid expenses, and certain clearing amounts. The Company's balance of other liabilities increased by $10 million, or 37%, during 2019 due to the booking of an operating lease liability as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nCapital Resources\nThe Company had total shareholders' equity of $309.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $273.0 million at December 31, 2018. The increase of $36.3 million, or 13%, is due to $36.0 million in net income and approximately $1.5 million in additional capital related to stock options, a $12.6 million increase in our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of $11.3 million in dividends paid and $2.5 million in stock repurchased. We maintained a very strong capital position throughout the recession and in the ensuing years, and our capital remains at relatively high levels in comparison to many of our peer banks.\nThe Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, including risk-based capital and leverage ratios that are calculated separately for the Company and the Bank. Management reviews these capital measurements on a quarterly basis and takes appropriate action to help ensure that they meet or surpass established internal and external guidelines. As permitted by the regulators for financial institutions that are not deemed to be advanced approaches\u201d institutions, the Company has elected to opt out of the Basel III requirement to include accumulated other comprehensive income in risk-based capital.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios at the dates indicated:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSierra Bancorp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.27% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.61% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.98% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.38% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.89% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Adjusted Average Assets (\"Leverage Ratio\")\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.91% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.49% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBank of the Sierra\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.75% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.25% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.75% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.25% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Capital to Risk-weighted Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15.25% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.77% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTier 1 Capital to Adjusted Average Assets (\"Leverage Ratio\")\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.73% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.39% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the end of 2019 the Company and the Bank were both classified as well capitalized,\u201d the highest rating of the categories defined under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, and our regulatory capital ratios remained above the median for peer financial institutions. We do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the Company or the Bank to be less than well capitalized, although no assurance can be given that this will not occur. A more detailed table of regulatory capital ratios, which includes the capital amounts and ratios required to qualify as well capitalized\u201d as well as minimum capital ratios, appears in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. For additional details on risk-based and leverage capital guidelines, requirements, and calculations and for a summary of changes to risk-based capital calculations which were recently approved by federal banking regulators, see Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d and Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action Provisions\u201d herein.\nThe federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio framework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized category under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying banking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent may opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework if has average consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an advance approaches banking organization.\nThe final rule became effective January 1, 2020 and banks that meet the qualifying criteria can elect to use the community bank leverage framework starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company and the Bank meet the criteria outlined in the final rule and are considering whether or not to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework.\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations and commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner. Detailed cash flow projections are reviewed by Management on a monthly basis, with various stress scenarios applied to assess our ability to meet liquidity needs under unusual or adverse conditions. Liquidity ratios are also calculated and reviewed on a regular basis. While those ratios are merely indicators and are not measures of actual liquidity, they are closely monitored and we are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity resources to draw upon should unexpected needs arise.\nThe Company, on occasion, experiences cash needs as the result of loan growth, deposit outflows, asset purchases or liability repayments. To meet short-term needs, we can borrow overnight funds from other financial institutions, draw advances via Federal Home Loan Bank lines of credit, or solicit brokered deposits if customer deposits are not immediately\nobtainable from local sources. Availability on lines of credit from correspondent banks and the FHLB totaled $523 million at December 31, 2019. The Company was also eligible to borrow approximately $59 million at the Federal Reserve Discount Window based on pledged assets at December 31, 2019. Furthermore, funds can be obtained by drawing down excess cash that might be available in the Company's correspondent bank deposit accounts, or by liquidating unpledged investments or other readily saleable assets. In addition, the Company can raise immediate cash for temporary needs by selling under agreement to repurchase those investments in its portfolio which are not pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2019, unpledged debt securities plus pledged securities in excess of current pledging requirements comprised $437 million of the Company's investment balances, as compared to $352 million at December 31, 2018. Other sources of potential liquidity include but are not necessarily limited to any outstanding fed funds sold and vault cash. The Company has a higher level of actual balance sheet liquidity than might otherwise be the case, since we utilize a letter of credit from the FHLB rather than investment securities for certain pledging requirements. That letter of credit, which is backed by loans pledged to the FHLB by the Company, totaled $105 million at December 31, 2019. Management is of the opinion that available investments and other potentially liquid assets, along with standby funding sources it has arranged, are more than sufficient to meet the Company's current and anticipated short-term liquidity needs.\nThe Company's net loans to assets and available investments to assets ratios were 68% and 17%, respectively, at December 31, 2019, as compared to internal policy guidelines of less than 78%\u201d and greater than 3%.\u201d Other liquidity ratios reviewed periodically by Management and the Board include net loans to total deposits and wholesale funding to total assets (including ratios and sub-limits for the various components comprising wholesale funding), which were all well within policy guidelines at December 31, 2019.\nThe holding company's primary uses of funds include operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, shareholder dividends, and stock repurchases. Its primary source of funds is dividends from the Bank, since the holding company does not conduct regular banking operations. Management anticipates that the Bank will have sufficient earnings to provide dividends to the holding company to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. Both the holding company and the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations on dividend payments, as outlined in Item 5(c) Dividends in this Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, nor does it have exposure to currency exchange rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and we have established policies and procedures to monitor and limit our earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The principal objective of interest rate risk management is to manage the financial components of the Company's balance sheet in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital under a variety of interest rate scenarios.\nTo identify areas of potential exposure to interest rate changes, we utilize commercially available modeling software to perform monthly earnings simulations and calculate the Company's market value of portfolio equity under varying interest rate scenarios. The model imports relevant information for the Company's financial instruments and incorporates Management's assumptions on pricing, duration, and optionality for anticipated new volumes. Various rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are then applied in order to calculate the expected effect of a given interest rate change on interest income, interest expense, and the value of the Company's financial instruments. The rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down), ramped (an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period), economic (based on current trends and econometric models) or stable (unchanged from current actual levels).\nIn addition to a stable rate scenario, which presumes that there are no changes in interest rates, we typically use at least six other interest rate scenarios in conducting our rolling 12-month net interest income simulations: upward shocks of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points, and downward shocks of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. Those scenarios may be supplemented, reduced in number, or otherwise adjusted as determined by Management to provide the most meaningful simulations in light of economic conditions and expectations at the time. We currently utilize an additional upward rate shock scenario of 400 basis points. Pursuant to policy guidelines, we generally attempt to limit the projected decline in net interest income relative to the stable rate scenario to no more than 5% for a 100 basis point (bp) interest rate shock, 10%\nfor a 200 bp shock, 15% for a 300 bp shock, and 20% for a 400 bp shock. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile, without factoring in any potential negative impact on spreads resulting from competitive pressures or credit quality deterioration:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImmediate Change in Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+400 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in Net Int.

In prior periods the simulations projected sizeable gains in net interest income in rising rate scenarios, but balance sheet changes such as the addition of fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans with longer reset periods, and the recent increase in interest rates have significantly diminished that effect. If there were an immediate and sustained upward adjustment of 100 basis points in interest rates, all else being equal, net interest income over the next 12 months is projected to improve by only $1.09 million, or 1.1%, relative to a stable interest rate scenario, with the favorable variance contracting very slightly as interest rates rise higher. If interest rates were to decline by 100 basis points, however, net interest income would likely be around $4.50 million lower than in a stable interest rate scenario, for a negative variance of 4.4%. The unfavorable variance increases when rates drop 200 or 300 basis points, due to the fact that certain deposit rates are already relatively low (on NOW accounts and savings accounts, for example), and will hit a natural floor of close to zero while non-floored variable-rate loan yields continue to drop. This effect is exacerbated by accelerated prepayments on fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities when rates decline, although rate floors on some of our variable-rate loans partially offset other negative pressures. While we view material interest rate reductions as unlikely in the near term, we will continue to monitor our interest rate risk profile and will apply remedial changes as deemed appropriate.\nIn addition to the net interest income simulations shown above, we run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank modeling the possibility of no balance sheet growth, the potential runoff of surge\u201d core deposits which flowed into the Bank in the most recent economic cycle, and unfavorable movement in deposit rates relative to yields on earning assets (i.e., higher deposit betas). When no balance sheet growth is incorporated and a stable interest rate environment is assumed, projected annual net interest income is about $6.4 million lower than in our standard simulation. However, the stressed simulations reveal that the Company's greatest potential pressure on net interest income would result from excessive non-maturity deposit runoff and/or unfavorable deposit rate changes in rising rate scenarios.\nThe economic value (or fair value\u201d) of financial instruments on the Company's balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. The difference between the projected fair value of the Company's financial assets and the fair value of its financial liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), and changes in EVE under different interest rate scenarios are effectively a gauge of the Company's longer-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at anticipated replacement interest rates for each account type, while the fair value of non-financial accounts is assumed to equal their book value for all rate scenarios. An economic value simulation is a static measure utilizing balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, and the measurement can change substantially over time as the Company's balance sheet evolves and interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated.\nThe change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including stated interest rates or spreads relative to current or projected market-level interest rates or spreads, the likelihood of principal prepayments, whether contractual interest rates are fixed or floating, and the average remaining time to maturity. As a general rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater the impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical patterns and Management's best estimates. Our EVE has increased in recent periods due to asset growth and higher discount rates, which result in a larger benefit assessed to non-maturity deposits. The table below shows estimated changes in the\nCompany's EVE as of December 31, 2019, under different interest rate scenarios relative to a base case of current interest rates:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImmediate Change in Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-300 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+100 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+200 bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+300 bp\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in EVE (in $000's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($94,510)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($115,378)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n($91,610)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$48,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$78,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+$96,382\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-17.13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-20.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-16.61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+8.74%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+14.19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n+17.47%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table shows that our EVE will generally deteriorate in declining rate scenarios, but should benefit from a parallel shift upward in the yield curve. The change in EVE flattens out as interest rates drop more than 200 basis points, while the rate of increase in EVE begins to taper off the higher interest rates rise. This phenomenon is caused by the relative durations of our fixed-rate assets and liabilities, combined with optionality inherent in our balance sheet. We also run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank's EVE to simulate the possibility of higher loan prepayment rates, unfavorable changes in deposit rates, and higher deposit decay rates. Model results are highly sensitive to changes in assumed decay rates for non-maturity deposits, in particular, with material unfavorable variances occurring relative to the standard simulations shown above as decay rates are increased. Furthermore, while not as extreme as the variances produced by increasing non-maturity deposit decay rates, EVE also displays a relatively high level of sensitivity to unfavorable changes in deposit rate betas in rising interest rate scenarios.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis discussion presents Management's analysis of the Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of operations for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K Annual Report (see Item 8 below).\nStatements contained in this report or incorporated by reference that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, including the Company's expectations, intentions, beliefs, or strategies regarding the future. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, growth rates, income, expenses, or other values which are included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date noted, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could materially differ from those in such forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those outlined previously in Item 1A.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The financial information and disclosures contained within those statements are significantly impacted by Management's estimates and judgments, which are based on historical experience and incorporate various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates under divergent conditions.\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, and have the greatest potential impact on the Company's stated results of operations. In Management's opinion, the Company's critical accounting policies deal with the following areas: the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses, as explained in detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Provision for Loan Losses\u201d and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; the valuation of impaired loans and foreclosed assets, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, especially with regard to the ability of the Company to recover deferred tax assets as discussed in the Provision for Income Taxes\u201d and Other Assets\u201d sections of this discussion and analysis; and goodwill and other intangible assets, which are evaluated annually for impairment and for which we have determined that no impairment exists, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and in the Other Assets\u201d section of this discussion and analysis. Critical accounting areas are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Company's financial statements incorporate the most recent expectations with regard to those areas.\nOverview of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nResults of Operations Summary\nThe Company recognized net income of $35.96 million in 2019 relative to $29.68 million in 2018 and $19.54 million in 2017. Net income per diluted share was $2.33 in 2019, as compared to $1.92 in 2018 and $1.36 for 2017. The Company's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.40% and 12.23%, respectively, in 2019, as compared to 1.23% and 11.37%, respectively, in 2018 and 0.93% and 8.82%, respectively, for 2017. Our financial results have been trending better for the past several years due in part to a higher volume of loans, a strong base of core deposits, and reductions in nonperforming assets. Our operating results and balance sheet have been materially impacted by a whole-bank acquisition in 2017, branch acquisitions in both 2017 and 2018, and nonrecurring items, as discussed in greater detail in the applicable sections below. Furthermore, the Company's financial performance was favorably affected by a substantially lower corporate income tax rate starting in 2018, but was negatively impacted in 2017 by a $2.71 million charge to our income tax provision as we revalued our net deferred tax asset to reflect the lower income tax rate enacted\nat the end of that year. The following is a summary of the major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n \u00b7 Net interest income improved by 5% in 2019 over 2018 and 22% in 2018 over 2017, due primarily to growth in average interest-earning assets. The increase in average earning assets in 2019 over 2018 was due primarily to a $90.0 million increase in average balance of real estate loans and a $48.1 million increase in average balances of mortgage warehouse loans, partially offset by decreases in other loan categories. The increase in real estate loans was driven primarily by organic growth in late 2018 and early 2019, but were offset by paydowns in the second half of 2019. The increase in average mortgage warehouse loans in 2019 was primarily a result of proactive pricing and marketing to mortgage lenders in the lower mortgage rate cycle in 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 over 2017 was due partly to recent acquisitions, but was largely organic, resulting from concerted business development efforts and lending opportunities inherent in expanded markets. The positive impact of average asset growth in 2019 was partially offset by a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin due to the lower rate environment in the second half of 2019. The increase in average earning assets in 2018 as compared to 2017 was further enhanced by net interest margin expansion of 20 basis points in 2018 resulting in part from short-term interest rate increases, discount accretion on acquisition loans, and a favorable shift in our mix of interest-earning assets. Net interest income has also been impacted by nonrecurring interest items, which added $0.82 million to interest income in 2019 relative to $0.28 million in 2018 and $0.74 million in 2017. \n \u00b7 We recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019, as compared to $4.35 million in 2018 and a negative provision of $1.14 million in 2017. The 2019 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances, including reserves set aside for a $2.8 million loan that was placed on non-accrual status shortly before the end of the third quarter. We recorded a partial charge-off of $1.2 million on that particular loan in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 2018 provision was deemed necessary subsequent to our determination of the appropriate level for our allowance for loan and lease losses, taking into consideration overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for specifically identified impaired loan balances (including $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on non-accrual status in the third quarter). The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances. \n \u00b7 Noninterest income increased by $1.91 million, or 9%, in 2019, but fell by $0.22 million or 1%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to favorable fluctuation in bank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income associated with deferred compensation income, and a nonrecurring charge in 2018 as described below. The decline in 2018 occurred as gains in deposit service charges, debit card interchange income, and other fees were offset by lower income from BOLI and a $0.91 million drop in nonrecurring income including the impact of an expense amortization adjustment on our tax credit investments (reflected as an offset to income). \n \u00b7 Noninterest expense increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The slight increase in noninterest expense in 2019 was due mostly to other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d) expense and directors deferred compensation expense associated with the BOLI income described above. These increases were mostly offset by lower occupancy expense. The escalation of noninterest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 includes the impact of acquisitions on ongoing operating costs and a relatively large increase in group health insurance costs, partially offset by favorable swings of $1.78 million in nonrecurring acquisition costs, $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs, and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income). \n \u00b7 The Company recorded income tax provisions of $11.76 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2019; $9.91 million, or 25% of pre-tax income in 2018; and $13.64 million, or 41% of pre-tax income in 2017. As expected, the overall tax rate remained relatively stable throughout 2019 and 2018. The lower tax rate for 2018 as compared to 2017 resulted from a reduction in our federal income tax rate starting in 2018 as \n well as a $2.71 million deferred tax asset revaluation charge in late 2017 after the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \nFinancial Condition Summary\nThe Company's assets totaled $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.52 billion at December 31, 2018. Total liabilities were $2.28 billion at December 31, 2019 as compared to $2.25 billion at the end of 2018, and shareholders' equity totaled $309 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $273 million at December 31, 2018. The following is a summary of key balance sheet changes during 2019.\n \u00b7 Total assets increased by $71 million, or 3%. The increase resulted primarily from earning asset growth including $31 million of gross loan growth and a $40 million increase in investment securities. \n \u00b7 Gross loans and leases were up $31 million, or 2%. Loan growth consisted mainly of growth in mortgage warehouse lines, partially offset by declines in other categories. \n \u00b7 Deposit balances reflect net growth of $52 million, or 2%. Deposit growth in 2019 was primarily a result of organic growth of noninterest bearing deposits of $28 million and a $14 million increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts. \n \u00b7 Total capital increased by $36 million, or 13%, ending the year with a balance of $309 million. The increase in capital is due mostly to the addition of net income and capital from stock options exercised, net of dividends paid. \nResults of Operations\nThe Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on deposits and other borrowed money. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non-customer sources such as BOLI and investment gains. The majority of the Company's noninterest expense is comprised of operating costs that facilitate offering a full range of banking services to our customers. As noted above, acquisitions have had a material impact on our operating results in recent periods, including the recognition of nonrecurring acquisition costs as well as higher revenues and ongoing overhead expense. Our results were also materially affected by the reduction in our federal income tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted at the end of 2017 and became effective at the beginning of 2018.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $97.37 million in 2019 as compared to $92.39 million in 2018 and $75.70 million in 2017. This equates to increases of 5% in 2019 and 22% in 2018. The level of net interest income we recognize in any given period depends on a combination of factors including the average volume and yield for interest-earning assets, the average volume and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and the mix of products which comprise the Company's earning assets, deposits, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also impacted by the reversal of interest for loans placed on non-accrual status, and the recovery of interest on loans that had been on non-accrual and were paid off, sold or returned to accrual status.\nThe following table shows average balances for significant balance sheet categories and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with each category for each of the past three years. The table also displays calculated yields on\neach major component of the Company's investment and loan portfolios, average rates paid on each key segment of the Company's interest-bearing liabilities, and our net interest margin for the noted periods.\n\n (1) Average balances are obtained from the best available daily or monthly data and are net of deferred fees and related direct costs. \n (2) Yields and net interest margin have been computed on a tax equivalent basis. \n (3) Loans are gross of the allowance for possible loan losses. Net loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income. Net loan fees and loan acquisition FMV amortization were $(0.35) million, $0.82 million, and $0.63 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. \n (4) Non-accrual loans are slotted by loan type and have been included in total loans for purposes of total interest earning assets. \n (5) Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (tax-equivalent). \nThe Volume and Rate Variances table below sets forth the dollar difference for the comparative periods in interest earned or paid for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of such change attributable to fluctuations in average balances (volume) or differences in average interest rates. Volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in average balances multiplied by prior period rates, and rate variances are equal to the\nchange in rates multiplied by prior period average balances. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes, calculated by multiplying the change in rates by the change in average balances, have been allocated to the rate variance.\n\nNet interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was impacted by a favorable volume variance of $5.30 million partially offset by a $0.32 million rate variance. For 2018 relative to 2017, net interest income reflects a favorable variance of $15.13 million attributable to volume changes, in addition to a favorable rate variance of $1.56 million.\nThe 2019 volume variance is due mostly to increases in average balances of real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines. However, the ending balance of real estate loans ended 2019 approximately 3% lower than the balance at December 31, 2018. For 2018, the volume variance is due to an overall increase of $277 million, or 14%, in average interest-earning\nassets, resulting from the impact of acquisitions and organic growth in loans less a $30 million drop in the average balance of investments.\nThe Company's net interest margin, which is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets declined by 5 basis points to 4.2% in 2019, but increased by 20 basis points in 2018 as compared to 2017. The 2019 unfavorable rate variance is due partially to a lower rate environment in 2019, as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets to lower yielding mortgage warehouse lines and non-taxable investment securities coupled with an increase in rates paid on time deposits. The 2018 favorable rate variance is largely the result of a higher rate environment favorably impacting our earning assets more than our costs of liabilities. In 2018, our yield on average earning assets increased 35 basis points relative to an increase of 23 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Investment yields increased in both 2019 and 2018 primarily due to a continued plan to shift to higher yielding municipal bonds, as well as a limited investment portfolio restructuring which took place in the latter part of 2017. Overall loan yields increased in both 2019 and 2018. Loan yields have risen as a result of the impact of higher short-term index rates on variable-rate loans, and a relatively large volume of new fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans booked at higher interest rates. The increase in loan yields in 2019 was partially offset by a shift to lower yielding mortgage warehouse loans. In addition, the company proactively lowered rates on certain mortgage warehouse relationships during 2019 in order to increase volumes. Rates paid on non-maturity deposits were about the same for the comparative periods due to overall low deposit betas on such products. The only exception was a 5 basis point increase on money market accounts, but overall money market account interest cost of 15 basis points remained low in 2019 relative to the industry. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities went up in both 2019 and 2018 primarily because of higher rates paid on time deposits (including brokered deposits added in the last half of 2018). If the Federal Open Markets Committee of the Federal Reserve System keeps the federal funds target rate at or near its current level throughout 2020, we would expect to see lower time deposit rates in 2020 due to the relatively short duration of our time deposit portfolio. Overnight borrowings and adjustable-rate trust-preferred securities ( TRUPS\u201d) are also tied to short-term rates which began lowering in the second half of 2019, but still remained higher overall in 2019 as compared to 2018. During the year, adjustments to interest income occur due to the following adjustments: interest income recovered upon the resolution of nonperforming loans, the reversal of interest income when a loan is placed on non-accrual status, and accelerated fees or prepayment penalties recognized for early payoffs of loans. Such adjustments totaled $0.82 million in 2019, $0.28 million in 2018, and $0.74 million in 2017. Further, discount accretion on loans from whole-bank acquisitions enhanced our net interest margin by approximately four basis points in 2019, seven basis points in 2018, and five basis points in 2017.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019; $4.35 million in 2018, and a negative loan loss provision of $1.14 million in 2017. Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company sets aside an allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset account, through periodic charges to earnings which are reflected in the income statement as a provision for loan and lease losses. The provision for loan and lease losses includes adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses pursuant to our evaluation of overall credit quality, growth in outstanding loan balances, and reserves required for other specifically identified impaired loan balances. Two separate impaired loans impacted the provision for loan and lease losses in both 2019 and 2018. In 2019, additional reserve was booked in the third quarter 2019 for a $2.8 million loan placed on nonaccrual status resulting in a $1.2 million charge-off. The provision for 2018 includes $2.4 million for a large purchased participation loan that was placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2018. The provision reversal in 2017 was made possible by principal recovered on charged-off loan balances.\nWith the loan loss provision recorded in 2019 we were able to maintain our allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that, in Management's judgment, is adequate to absorb probable loan losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as well as probable incurred losses in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable loan losses are immediately charged off against the allowance. The Company experienced net loan losses of $2.38 million in 2019, including a $1.2 million charge-off on the loan placed on nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2019 as mentioned above. The Company experienced net loan losses of $3.64 million in 2018, including a $2.4 million loss on the above-referenced participation loan. The Company recorded net recoveries of $0.48 million on charged off balances in 2017. The loan and lease loss provision for 2019 and 2018 has been favorably impacted by the following factors: most charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve\nreplenishment; loss rates for most loan types have been declining, thus having a positive impact on general reserves required for performing loans; and, new loans booked have been underwritten using continued tighter credit standards.\nThe Company's policies for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance and determining loan amounts that should be charged off, and other detailed information with regard to changes in the allowance, are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and below under Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.\u201d The process utilized to establish an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses can result in a high degree of variability in the Company's loan loss provision, and consequently in our net earnings.\nNoninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\nThe table below sets forth the major components of the Company's noninterest revenue and operating expense for the years indicated, along with relevant ratios:\n\n (1) Tax Equivalent \n (2) Noninterest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and noninterest income excluding net gains (losses) from securities and bank owned life insurance income. \nNoninterest income improved in 2019 with a $1.91 million increase, or 9%, as compared to a decline of $0.21 million, or 1%, in 2018. Total noninterest income was 1.00% of average interest-earning asset in 2019 as compared to a ratio of 0.98% in 2018 and 1.13% in 2017. The ratio declined in 2018 primarily due to a 14% increase in interest-earning assets and a slightly lower level of noninterest income due mostly to lower BOLI income.\nThe principal component of the Company's noninterest revenue, service charges on deposit accounts, increased by $0.30 million, or 2%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item improved by $1.21 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. This line item is primarily driven by the volume of transaction accounts. As a percent of average transaction account balances, service charge income was 1.0% in 2019 and 2018, and was 1.1% in 2017.\nCheckcard fees consists of interchange fees from our customers' use of debit cards for electronic funds transactions. This category increased by $0.71 million, or 12%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.92 million, or 19%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily a result of growth in our deposit account base as well as increased usage of debit cards by our customers.\nOther service charges and fees declined by $0.99 million, or 19%, after increasing by $1.17 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019, as well as the increase for 2018 was due largely to two infrequent items occurring in 2018. In 2018, we had a $1.18 million write-up of our investment in Pacific Coast Bankers Bank ( PCBB\u201d) as well as a $0.16 million special dividend received pursuant to our equity investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco ( FHLB\u201d).\nBOLI income generally fluctuates based on the market. In 2019, BOLI income increased by $1.59 million, or 270%, over 2018, whereas such income decreased by $1.05 million, or 64%, in 2018 over 2017. BOLI income is derived from two types of policies owned by the Company, namely separate account\u201d and general account\u201d life insurance, and the year over year variances are due in large part to fluctuations in income on separate account BOLI. The Company had $8.0 million invested in separate account BOLI at December 31, 2019, which produces income that helps offset expense accruals for deferred compensation accounts the Company maintains on behalf of certain directors and senior officers. Those accounts have returns pegged to participant-directed investment allocations that can include equity, bond, or real estate indices, and are thus subject to gains or losses which often contribute to significant fluctuations in income (and associated expense accruals). Gains on separate account BOLI totaled $1.22 million in 2019 as compared to net losses of $0.38 million in 2018, and gains of $0.69 million in 2017. This resulted in a favorable variance of $1.07 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and an unfavorable variance of $1.13 million in 2018 over 2017. As noted, gains and losses on separate account BOLI are related to expense accruals or reversals associated with participant gains and losses on deferred compensation balances, thus the overall net impact on taxable income tends to be minimal. The Company's books also reflect a net cash surrender value for general account BOLI of $42.5 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $41.6 million at year-end 2018. General account BOLI produces income that is used to help offset expenses associated with executive salary continuation plans, director retirement plans and other employee benefits. Interest credit rates on general account BOLI do not change frequently so the income has typically been fairly consistent with $0.97 million, $0.97 million and $0.95 million of general account BOLI income recorded for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company recognized a $0.20 million loss in 2019, as compared to a nominal gain in 2018 and a $0.50 million gain in 2017. The loss in 2019 was taken in order to sell several small balance and low-yielding bonds in order to replace them with fewer higher-yielding bonds. The earnback of the transaction was less than a year.\nLoss on tax credit investment reflects pass-through expenses associated with our investments in low-income housing tax credit funds and other limited partnerships. Those expenses, which are netted out of revenue, decreased by $0.48 million, or 19%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. In 2018 as compared to 2017, these expenses increased by $1.60 million, or 166%. The largest contribution to the favorable variance in 2019, as well as the unfavorable variance in 2018 came from a $0.91 million adjustment to accelerate expense amortization on our tax credit investments, to ensure that the book value of each investment does not exceed its projected remaining tax benefits. The remainder of the annual variances primarily relate to expense amortization for newer investments, as well as a gain of $0.32 million realized in 2017 from the dissolution of one of our earliest tax credit investment funds.\nTotal operating expense, or noninterest expense, increased by $0.55 million, or 1%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $4.58 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. Although overall noninterest expense did not fluctuate significantly from 2019 to 2018, several line items fluctuated with the largest single item being deposit service costs of $2.55 million. This increase was mostly offset by several smaller changes in other line items. The increase for 2018 as compared to 2017 is due primarily to a full year of operating costs associated with the Ojai whole-bank acquisition and a partial year of costs for the Lompoc branch acquisition, offset in part by favorable swings of $1.00 million in net foreclosed asset costs and $0.70 million in directors deferred compensation expense (related to the drop in BOLI income). Noninterest expense as a percent of average interest-earning assets trended down each year. This ratio was 3.0% in 2019, 3.2% in 2018 and 3.4% in 2017.\nThe largest component of noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits, was down $0.16 million, or 0.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The same line item was up by $4.63 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. Salary expense declined in 2019 as compared to 2018 in part due to selective staff reductions even though there was some increase to deferred compensation expenses as well as the normal annual salary increases. Personnel costs increased in 2018 due to a full year of costs for employees retained subsequent to our acquisitions in 2017 and offices opened in 2017, staffing costs for the Lompoc branch acquired in 2018, salary adjustments in the normal course of business, and an increase of $0.59 million, or 23%, in group health insurance costs. Components of compensation expense that can experience significant variability and are typically difficult to predict include salaries associated with successful loan originations, which are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidelines on the recognition and measurement of non-refundable fees and origination costs for lending activities, and accruals associated with employee deferred compensation plans. Loan origination salaries that were deferred from current expense for recognition over the life of related loans totaled $3.68 million in 2019, $4.17 million in 2018, and $3.85 million for 2017. Employee deferred compensation expense accruals totaled only $0.23 million in 2019, an increase of $0.22 million from 2018. Such deferred compensation expenses was $0.22 million in 2017. As noted above in our discussion of BOLI income, employee deferred compensation plan accruals are related to separate account BOLI income and losses, as are directors deferred compensation accruals that are included in other professional services,\u201d and the net income impact of all income/expense accruals related to deferred compensation is usually minimal. Salaries and benefits were 51.0% of total operating expense in 2019, relative to 51.6% in 2018 and 48.1% in 2017. The number of full-time equivalent staff employed by the Company totaled 513 at the end of 2019, as compared to 541 at December 31, 2018 and 560 at December 31, 2017. The reductions each year came from efficiency initiatives implemented toward the end of the 2018 which continued throughout 2019.\nTotal rent and occupancy expense, including furniture and equipment costs, decreased by $0.45 million, or 4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.70 million, or 7%, in 2018 over 2017. The decline in 2019 was primarily due to lower depreciation expenses and lower maintenance/repair costs in 2019. The increase for 2018 includes the impact of the acquisition and de novo branch offices in 2017 and 2018, and was also due in part to an accrual adjustment that inflated rent expense in 2017.\nAdvertising and promotion costs decreased by 7% to $2.57 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.23 million, or 9%, in 2018 over 2017. The increase in 2018 was mainly the result of marketing efforts targeting our expanded geography, and other promotional expenses associated with opening new branches.\nData processing costs decreased by $0.45 million, or 9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.65 million, or 15%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to lower core software provider costs. The increase in 2018 is primarily from additional core processing costs and other software costs associated with Bank expansion.\nDeposit services costs increased by $2.55 million, or 47%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.99 million, or 22%, in 2018 over 2017. In 2019, approximately $1.5 million of costs associated with statement printing costs that were previously recorded in Other Operations Expenses and Stationary & Supplies Expense were reclassified to Data Processing costs. The purpose of the reclassification was to better track the costs associated with producing paper statements for our customers so that we could better track progress against our strategy to lower such costs. Deposit costs were further impacted by increases in debit card processing and ATM network costs due to higher activity levels. Most of the increase in 2018 for deposit costs was the result of ongoing expenses associated with our acquisitions.\nLoan services costs are comprised of loan processing costs, and net costs associated with foreclosed assets. Loan processing costs, which include expenses for property appraisals and inspections, loan collections, demand and foreclosure activities, loan servicing, loan sales, and other miscellaneous lending costs, decreased by $0.47 million, or 41%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by $0.11 million, or 11%, in 2018 over 2017. The decrease in 2019 was due to smaller declines in almost every category of loan servicing including collections, appraisals, foreclosure costs, title, flood as a result of a dramatic reduction in the amount of residential first mortgages made by the Company. The increase in 2018 resulted from a higher level of these same costs including appraisal, inspection and credit reporting costs incidental to more robust lending activity. Foreclosed assets costs are comprised of write-downs taken subsequent to reappraisals, OREO operating expense (including property taxes), and losses on the sale of foreclosed assets, net of rental income on OREO properties and gains on the sale of foreclosed assets. Those costs were just $0.04 million in 2019 as compared to a $0.74 million net gain in 2018 and costs of $0.27 million in 2017. These costs fluctuate based on market conditions of OREO relative to our holding value and the nature of the underlying property.\nThe other operating costs\u201d category includes telecommunications expense, postage, and other miscellaneous costs. Telecommunications expense increased slightly by 3% to $1.53 million in 2019, as compared to $1.48 million in 2018. Such expense was $0.17 million, or 11%, lower in 2018 than in 2017, due to focused expense reduction efforts. Postage expense increased by $0.56 million, or 56%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased by 6% in 2018 relative to 2017. The significant decline in 2019 was due mostly to a reclassification of nearly the entire annual variance to deposit services costs related to paper statements as described above. The Other\u201d category under other operating costs was up by $0.39 million, or 28%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and up by $0.32 million, or 29%, in 2018 over 2017. The increases in both years are due mostly to higher consulting and training costs as well as higher recruiting costs in 2019.\nTotal Professional Services costs increased by $0.25 million, or 6%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, as compared to a $1.69 million, or 27%, decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017. Professional Services costs consists of legal and accounting, acquisition, and other professional services costs. Legal and Accounting costs increased by $0.14 million, or 7%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and increased by $0.40 million, or 26%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 was mostly due to increased audit and compliance costs as a result of an enhanced risk management program. The increase in 2018 was due mostly higher audit and tax costs and higher legal costs associated with collections. Acquisition costs, or one-time expenses directly attributable to our whole-bank and branch acquisitions, totaled just $0.02 million in 2019, as compared to $0.45 million in 2018 and $2.22 million in 2017. Acquisition costs are comprised primarily of termination fees for core processing contracts and certain other contracts, software conversion costs, financial advisor fees, legal costs, severance and retention amounts paid to employees of the acquired institutions, and the write-off of furniture, fixtures and equipment that were not utilized by the Company. Other professional services costs include FDIC assessments and other regulatory expenses, directors' costs, and certain insurance costs among other things. This category increased by $0.54 million, or 27%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, and declined by $0.31 million, or 14%, in 2018 relative to 2017. The increase in 2019 is mostly due to a $0.85 million increase in directors' deferred compensation expense as described above under the separate account BOLI. This deferred compensation expense increase is mostly offset by higher BOLI income. In addition, FDIC and State exam assessment expenses declined by $0.33 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. The decline in this category in 2018 stems from a favorable swing of $0.70 million in director's deferred compensation expense, which more than offset higher FDIC costs and corporate insurance premiums.\nStationery and supply costs decreased by $1.07 million, or 77%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a reclassification of customer paper statement expense to deposit services costs as described above. This same category increased by $0.08 million, or 6%, in 2018 over 2017, due to costs associated with Bank expansion.\nSundry and teller costs of $0.28 million in 2019; $0.40 million in 2018 and $0.60 million in 2017 primarily reflect operational losses, including debit card disputes. These costs continue to trend downward due to better technology and education.\nThe Company's tax-equivalent overhead efficiency ratio was 57.5% in 2019, 60.8% in 2018, and 65.5% in 2017. The overhead efficiency ratio represents total noninterest expense divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest and noninterest income, with the provision for loan losses and investment gains/losses excluded from the equation. The ratio trended downward due to continued efforts to control costs, as well as to higher income. Further, acquisition costs in 2017 also impacted the ratio unfavorably.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provision was $11.76 million, or 24.6% of pre-tax income in 2019 as compared to $9.91 million, or 25.0% of pre-tax income in 2018, and $13.640 million, or 41.1% of pre-tax income in 2017. The tax accrual rate was approximately the same in 2019 as it was in 2018. The tax accrual rate dropped in 2018 because of a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe Company sets aside a provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The amount of that provision is determined by first applying the Company's statutory income tax rates to estimated taxable income, which is pre-tax book income adjusted for permanent differences, and then subtracting available tax credits. Permanent differences include but are not limited to tax-exempt interest income, BOLI income, and certain book expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions. The Company's investments in state, county and municipal bonds provided $4.53 million of federal tax-exempt income in 2019, $4.06 million in 2018, and $3.71 million in 2017. Moreover, in addition to life insurance proceeds of $0.50 million in 2017, net increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance added $2.18 million to tax-exempt income in 2019; $0.59 million in 2018, and $1.64 million in 2017.\nOur tax credits consist primarily of those generated by investments in low-income housing tax credit funds, and California state employment tax credits. We had a total of $4.1 million invested in low-income housing tax credit funds as of December 31, 2019 and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2018, which are included in other assets rather than in our investment portfolio. Those investments have generated substantial tax credits over the past few years, with about $0.54 million in credits available for the 2019 tax year; $0.63 million for the 2018 tax year, and $0.71 million in 2017. The credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants, and cannot be projected with certainty. Furthermore, our capacity to utilize them will continue to depend on our ability to generate sufficient pre-tax income. We plan to invest in additional tax credit funds in the future, but if the economics of such transactions do not justify continued investments then the level of low-income housing tax credits will taper off in future years until they are substantially utilized by the end of 2028. That means that even if taxable income stayed at the same level through 2028, our tax accrual rate would gradually increase.\nFinancial Condition\nAssets totaled $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $71.32 million, or 3%, for the year. Assets increased in 2019 primarily due to a $40.32 million increase in investment securities and a $30.76 million, or 2% increase, in net loans and leases. Deposits were up $52.03 million, or 2%. Total capital increased by $36.26 million, or 13%. The major components of the Company's balance sheet are individually analyzed below, along with information on off-balance sheet activities and exposure.\nLoan and Lease Portfolio\nThe Company's loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets, substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category, and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the Company's financial condition.\nThe Selected Financial Data table in Item 6 above reflects the amount of loans and leases outstanding at December 31st for each year from 2019 back to 2015, net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Loan and Lease Distribution table that follows sets forth by loan type the Company's gross loans and leases outstanding, and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated. The balances for each loan type include nonperforming loans, if any, but do not reflect any deferred or unamortized loan origination, extension, or commitment fees, or deferred loan origination costs. Although not reflected in the loan totals below and not currently comprising a\nmaterial part of our lending activities, the Company also occasionally originates and sells, or participates out portions of, loans to non-affiliated investors.\n\nThe Company has experienced net growth in loan and lease balances in each of the last five years, despite fluctuations caused by variability in outstanding balances on mortgage warehouse lines, reductions associated with the resolution of impaired loans, weak loan demand in some years, tightened underwriting standards, and intense competition. This growth is due in part to acquisitions, including Coast National Bank in 2016 and Ojai Community Bank in 2017, as well as whole loan purchases and participations. Organic loan growth has also been relatively robust in recent periods, particularly with regard to commercial real estate and construction loans.\nFor 2019, gross loans were up by $31 million, or 2%, due to growth in mortgage warehouse lines, partially offset by declines in all other loan categories. Mortgage warehouse lines increased by $97.29 million, or 106%, in 2019 primarily due to a strategy to focus on volume given the short duration of these loans. This growth strategy involved providing more competitive pricing to mortgage originators coupled with a stronger emphasis on calling efforts. The largest single decline in any other category of loans during 2019 was real estate loans of $44.31 million, or 3%, mostly due to a strategic decision to significantly reduce our activity of residential mortgages. Residential mortgage loan balances declined by\napproximately $43.0 million in 2019. As a result of the declines in other loans categories including commercial real estate and commercial & industrial loans, the Company announced in early 2020 the opening of a loan production office in Northern California (Rocklin, California) and an expansion of the loan team in Southern California.\nAs demonstrated by the expansion of the lending teams, management remains focused on organic loan growth. However, no assurance can be provided with regard to future net growth in aggregate loan balances given occasional surges in prepayments and fluctuations in mortgage warehouse lending.\nLoan and Lease Maturities\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution for total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including non-accruing loans, grouped by remaining scheduled principal payments:\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the Company's liquidity position, balance sheet repricing characteristics, and sensitivity to interest rates changes, refer to the Liquidity and Market Risk\u201d section of this discussion and analysis.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company maintains commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business, as long as there are no violations of conditions established in the outstanding contractual arrangements. Unused commitments to extend credit totaled $492 million at December 31, 2019 and $782 million at December 31, 2018, although it is not likely that all of those commitments will ultimately be drawn down. The decrease in 2019 is due in part to a higher utilization of mortgage warehouse lines in 2019. Unused commitments represented approximately 28% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 45% at December 31, 2018. The Company also had undrawn letters of credit issued to customers totaling $9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Off-balance sheet obligations pose potential credit risk to the Company, and a $0.31 million reserve for unfunded commitments is reflected as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, down from $0.384 million at December 31, 2018. The effect on the Company's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will ever be used. However, the Liquidity\u201d section in this Form 10-K outlines resources available to draw upon should we be required to fund a significant portion of unused commitments.\nIn addition to unused commitments to provide credit, the Company is utilizing a $105 million letter of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank on the Company's behalf as security for certain deposits and to facilitate certain credit arrangements with the Company's customers. That letter of credit is backed by loans which are pledged to the FHLB by the Company. For more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 herein.\nContractual Obligations\nAt the end of 2019, the Company had contractual obligations for the following payments, by type and period due:\n\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets ( NPAs\u201d) are comprised of loans for which the Company is no longer accruing interest, and foreclosed assets which primarily consists of OREO. If the Company grants a concession to a borrower in financial difficulty, the loan falls into the category of a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d), which may be designated as either nonperforming or performing depending on the loan's accrual status.\nThe following table presents comparative data for the Company's NPAs and performing TDRs as of the dates noted:\n\n (1) Performing TDRs are not included in nonperforming loans above, nor are they included in the numerators used to calculate the ratios disclosed in this table. \nNPAs totaled $6.5 million, or 0.3% of gross loans and leases plus foreclosed assets at the end of 2019, up slightly from $6.2 million, or 0.3% of gross loans and leases plus foreclosed assets at the end of 2018. NPAs were reduced by $3.2 million, or 34%, during 2018, and the decline is even more dramatic when looking further back in time. This reduction\nhas occurred in response to better economic conditions and our continuous efforts to improve credit quality. Not reflected in the period-end numbers is the addition of a $10 million purchased participation loan to nonperforming loans in August 2018. That loan was written down by a total of $2.4 million, and was ultimately transferred to OREO and sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nNonperforming loans secured by real estate comprised $5.1 million of total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million, or 41%, since December 31, 2018. This was mostly offset by a decline in Commercial & Industrial and Consumer nonperforming loans during 2019. We have no reason to believe that there will be additional material increases in nonperforming real estate or commercial loans in the near term, but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Nonperforming loan balances at December 31, 2019 include $2.6 million in TDRs and other loans that were paying as agreed, but which met the technical definition of nonperforming and were classified as such. We also had $8.4 million in loans classified as performing TDRs for which we were still accruing interest at December 31, 2019, a drop of $2.6 million, or 24%, relative to December 31, 2018. Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements provide a more comprehensive disclosure of TDR balances and activity within recent periods.\nThe balance of foreclosed assets had a carrying value of $0.80 million at December 31, 2019, comprised of 10 properties classified as OREO and two mobile homes. At the end of 2018 foreclosed assets totaled $1.1 million, consisting of 11 properties classified as OREO. All foreclosed assets are periodically evaluated and written down to their fair value less expected disposition costs, if lower than the then-current carrying value. An action plan is in place for each of our non-accruing loans and foreclosed assets and they are all being actively managed. Collection efforts are continuously pursued for all nonperforming loans, but no assurance can be provided that they will be resolved in a timely manner or that nonperforming balances will not increase.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses, a contra-asset, is established through a provision for loan and lease losses. It is maintained at a level that is considered adequate to absorb probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans, as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance; recoveries are generally recorded only when sufficient cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements provides a more comprehensive discussion of the accounting guidance we conform to and the methodology we use to determine an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe Company's allowance for loan and lease losses was $9.9 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019, relative to $9.8 million, or 0.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2018. The increase in the allowance resulted from the addition of a $2.55 million loan loss provision in 2019, less $2.38 million in net loan charge-offs. Reserves were established for losses inherent in incremental loan balances and unanticipated charge-offs in 2019. The net increase in the allowance might have been even larger if not for the following circumstances: many charge-offs were recorded against pre-established reserves, which alleviated what otherwise might have been a need for reserve replenishment; all acquired loans were booked at their fair values, and thus did not initially require a loan loss allowance; and loan loss rates have been declining, having a positive impact on general reserves established for performing loans. The ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans was 173.0% at December 31, 2019, relative to 189.1% at December 31, 2018, and 228.2% at December 31, 2017. As described above, a separate allowance of $0.31 million for potential losses inherent in unused commitments is included in other liabilities at December 31, 2019.\nThe table that follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated:\n\nAs shown in the table above, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $2.55 million in 2019 compared to $4.35 million in 2018, and a negative loan loss provision of $1.14 million in 2017. Our allowance for probable losses on specifically identified impaired loans was reduced by $1.18 million, or 59%, during 2019, whereas it was increased by $0.85 million, or 74%, during 2018. The allowance for probable losses inherent in non-impaired loans increased by $1.3 million, or 17%, as a result of potential local, national and global economic conditions on the loan portfolio. The Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d section above includes additional details on our provision and its relationship to actual charge-offs.\nProvided below is a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated. The allocation presented should not be viewed as an indication that charges to the allowance will be incurred in these amounts or proportions, or that the portion of the allowance allocated to a particular loan category represents the total amount available for charge-offs that may occur within that category.\n\n (1) Represents percentage of loans in category to total loans \n (2) Includes mortgage warehouse lines \nThe Company's allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2019 represents Management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio as of that date, but no assurance can be given that the Company will not experience substantial losses relative to the size of the allowance. Furthermore, fluctuations in credit quality, changes in economic conditions, updated accounting or regulatory requirements, and/or other factors could induce us to augment or reduce the allowance. The Company adopted the current expected credit losses methodology on January 1, 2020. Initial estimates indicate that our allowance for loan and lease losses will increase by $12 million relative to current levels however the exact impact has not been definitively determined at this time.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments can at any given time consist of debt securities and marketable equity securities (together, the investment portfolio\u201d), investments in the time deposits of other banks, surplus interest-earning balances in our Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) account, and overnight fed funds sold. Surplus FRB balances and fed funds sold to correspondent banks typically represent the temporary investment of excess liquidity. The Company's investments serve several purposes: 1) they provide liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; 2) they provide a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits, bankruptcy deposits and certain borrowed funds which require collateral; 3) they constitute a large base of assets with maturity and interest rate characteristics that can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio, to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Company; 4) they are another interest-earning option for surplus funds when loan demand is light; and 5) they can provide partially tax exempt income. Aggregate investments totaled $615 million, or 24% of total assets at December 31, 2019, as compare to $562 million, or 22% of total assets at December 31, 2018.\nWe had no fed funds sold at the end of the reporting periods, and interest-bearing balances held primarily in our Federal Reserve Bank account totaled $15 million at December 31, 2019, as compared to $2 million at December 31, 2018. The Company's investment securities portfolio had a book balance of $601 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $560 million at December 31, 2018, reflecting a net increase of $41 million for 2019. The Company carries investments at their fair market values. We currently have the intent and ability to hold our investment securities to maturity, but the securities are all marketable and are classified as available for sale\u201d to allow maximum flexibility with regard to interest rate risk and liquidity management. The expected average life for bonds in our investment portfolio was 4.4 years and their average effective duration was 3.2 years at December 31, 2019, as compared to an expected average life of 4.1 years and an average effective duration of 3.3 years at year-end 2018.\nThe following Investment Portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for each primary category of investment securities for the past three years:\n\nThe net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio, or the amount by which aggregate fair market values exceeded the amortized cost, was $8.4 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to a net loss of $9.5 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $17.9 million. The change was caused by lower market interest rates on fixed-rate bond values. The balance of U.S. Government agency securities in our portfolio declined by $3.1 million, or 20%, during 2019 due primarily to bond maturities and a strategy to change the mix of the portfolio to more heavily weight municipal bonds. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities increased by $4 million, or 1% due to prepayments not being reinvested. Municipal bond balances increased by $47.7 million, or 34%. Municipal bonds purchased in recent periods have strong underlying ratings, and all municipal bonds in our portfolio undergo a detailed quarterly review for potential impairment.\nInvestment securities that were pledged as collateral for Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, repurchase agreements, public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law totaled $235 million at December 31, 2019 and $217 million at December 31, 2018, leaving $366 million in unpledged debt securities at December 31, 2019 and $343 million at December 31, 2018. Securities that were pledged in excess of actual pledging needs and were thus available for liquidity purposes, if needed, totaled $71 million at December 31, 2019 and $9 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe table below groups the Company's investment securities by their remaining time to maturity as of December 31, 2019, and provides weighted average yields for each segment. Since the actual timing of principal payments may differ from contractual maturities when obligors have the right to prepay principal, maturities for mortgage-backed securities (including collateralized mortgage obligations) were determined by incorporating expected prepayments.\n\nCash and Due from Banks\nInterest-earning cash balances were discussed above in the Investments\u201d section, but the Company also maintains a certain level of cash on hand in the normal course of business as well as non-earning deposits at other financial institutions. Our balance of cash and due from banks depends on the timing of collection of outstanding cash items (checks), the amount of cash held at our branches and our reserve requirement, among other things, and is subject to significant fluctuations in the normal course of business. While cash flows are normally predictable within limits, those limits are fairly broad and the Company manages its short-term cash position through the utilization of overnight loans to, and borrowings from, correspondent banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Should a large short\u201d overnight position persist for any length of time, the Company typically raises money through focused retail deposit\ngathering efforts or by adding brokered time deposits. If a long\u201d position is prevalent, we will let brokered deposits or other wholesale borrowings roll off as they mature, or we might invest excess liquidity into longer-term, higher-yielding bonds. The Company's balance of noninterest earning cash and balances due from correspondent banks totaled $66 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2019, and $72 million, or 3% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The average balance of non-earning cash and due from banks, which can be used to determine trends, was $61 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated on our books at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The cost of furniture and equipment is expensed as depreciation over the estimated useful life of the related assets, and leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements, whichever is shorter.\nThe following premises and equipment table reflects the original cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization, and net book value of fixed assets by major category, for the years noted:\n\nThe net book value of the Company's premises and equipment was 1.1% of total assets at December 31, 2019, relative to 1.2% at December 31, 2018. Depreciation and amortization included in occupancy and equipment expense totaled $2.8 million in 2019 and $3.0 million in 2018.\nOther Assets\nGoodwill totaled $27.4 million at December 31, 2019, unchanged for the year and other intangible assets were $5.4 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 17%, as a result of amortization expense recorded on core deposit intangibles. The Company's goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated annually for potential impairment following FASB guidelines, and based on those analytics Management has determined that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2019.\nThe net cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies increased to $50.5 million at December 31, 2019 from $48.2 million at December 31, 2018, due to the addition of BOLI income to net cash surrender values. Refer to the Noninterest Revenue and Operating Expense\u201d section above for a more detailed discussion of BOLI and the income it generates.\nThe remainder of other assets consists primarily of operating leases upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (Topic 842) in 2019, accrued interest receivable, deferred taxes, investments in bank stocks, other real estate owned, prepaid assets, investments in low income housing credits, and other miscellaneous assets. The total operating lease right-of-use asset recorded on the books is $9.9 million less accumulated amortization of $1.6 million. The bank stocks include Pacific Coast Bankers Bank stock and restricted stock related to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco stock held in conjunction with our FHLB borrowings, and is not deemed to be marketable or liquid. Our net\ndeferred tax asset is evaluated as of every reporting date pursuant to FASB guidance, and we have determined that no impairment exists.\nDeposits\nDeposits represent another key balance sheet category impacting the Company's net interest margin and profitability metrics. Deposits provide liquidity to fund growth in earning assets, and the Company's net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits is concentrated in less volatile and typically less costly non-maturity deposits such as demand deposit accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and money market demand accounts. Information concerning average balances and rates paid by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the Distribution, Rate, and Yield table located in the previous section under Results of Operations-Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin.\u201d A distribution of the Company's deposits showing the period-end balance and percentage of total deposits by type is presented as of the dates noted in the following table:\n\nDeposit balances reflect net growth of $52 million, or 2%, in 2019 and $128 million, or 6%, during 2018. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to organic growth. The increase in 2018 is due to acquired Lompoc branch deposits totaling $34 million at December 31, 2018, the addition of $50 million in wholesale brokered deposits, and growth in customer time deposits. Customer time deposits increased by $86 million, or 23%, due primarily to a marketing campaign targeting those deposits in the fourth quarter of 2018, but the increase also includes about $7 million in time deposits in the acquired Lompoc branch at the end of the year.\nNon-interest bearing demand deposit balances were up $28 million, or 4%, and NOW accounts increased by $24 million, or 6% in 2019. Overall non-maturity deposits increased by $48 million, or 3%, to $1.65 billion at December 31, 2019.\nManagement is of the opinion that a relatively high level of core customer deposits is one of the Company's key strengths, and we continue to strive for core deposit retention and growth. Our deposit-targeted promotions are still favorably impacting growth in the number of accounts and it is expected that balances in these accounts will grow over time consistent with our past experience, although given the current highly competitive market for deposits no assurance can be provided with regard to future core deposit increases.\nThe scheduled maturity distribution of the Company's time deposits at the end of 2019 was as follows:\n\nOther Borrowings\nThe Company's non-deposit borrowings may, at any given time, include fed funds purchased from correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, advances from the FRB, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and/or junior subordinated debentures. The Company uses short-term FHLB advances and fed funds purchased on uncommitted lines to support liquidity needs created by seasonal deposit flows, to temporarily satisfy funding needs from increased loan demand, and for other short-term purposes. The FHLB line is committed, but the amount of available credit depends on the level of pledged collateral.\nTotal non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities were down by $27 million, or 25%, in 2019, due to decreases in FHLB advances, partially offset by increases in customer repurchase agreements. Non-deposit interest-bearing liabilities increased by $43 million, or 66%, in 2018, due to increases in FHLB borrowings and customer repurchase agreements. The Company had $20 million in short-term borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2019, as compared to $56 million in overnight FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2018. There were no overnight federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks or advances from the FRB on our books at December 31, 2019 or 2018. Repurchase agreements totaled over $26 million at year-end 2019 relative to a balance of $16 million at year-end 2018. Repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts\u201d, where commercial deposit balances above a specified threshold are transferred at the close of each business day into non-deposit accounts secured by investment securities. The Company had junior subordinated debentures totaling $34.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $34.8 million December 31, 2018, in the form of long-term borrowings from trust subsidiaries formed specifically to issue trust preferred securities. The small increase resulted from the amortization of discount on junior subordinated debentures that were part of our acquisition of Coast Bancorp in 2016.\nThe details of the Company's short-term borrowings are presented in the table below, for the years noted:\n\nOther Noninterest Bearing Liabilities\nOther liabilities are principally comprised of accrued interest payable, other accrued but unpaid expenses, and certain clearing amounts. The Company's balance of other liabilities increased by $10 million, or 37%, during 2019 due to the booking of an operating lease liability as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\nCapital Resources\nThe Company had total shareholders' equity of $309.3 million at December 31, 2019 as compared to $273.0 million at December 31, 2018. The increase of $36.3 million, or 13%, is due to $36.0 million in net income and approximately $1.5 million in additional capital related to stock options, a $12.6 million increase in our accumulated other comprehensive income, net of $11.3 million in dividends paid and $2.5 million in stock repurchased. We maintained a very strong capital position throughout the recession and in the ensuing years, and our capital remains at relatively high levels in comparison to many of our peer banks.\nThe Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy, including risk-based capital and leverage ratios that are calculated separately for the Company and the Bank. Management reviews these capital measurements on a quarterly basis and takes appropriate action to help ensure that they meet or surpass established internal and external guidelines. As permitted by the regulators for financial institutions that are not deemed to be advanced approaches\u201d institutions, the Company has elected to opt out of the Basel III requirement to include accumulated other comprehensive income in risk-based capital.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios at the dates indicated:\n\nAt the end of 2019 the Company and the Bank were both classified as well capitalized,\u201d the highest rating of the categories defined under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, and our regulatory capital ratios remained above the median for peer financial institutions. We do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the Company or the Bank to be less than well capitalized, although no assurance can be given that this will not occur. A more detailed table of regulatory capital ratios, which includes the capital amounts and ratios required to qualify as well capitalized\u201d as well as minimum capital ratios, appears in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. For additional details on risk-based and leverage capital guidelines, requirements, and calculations and for a summary of changes to risk-based capital calculations which were recently approved by federal banking regulators, see Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy Requirements\u201d and Item 1, Business - Supervision and Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action Provisions\u201d herein.\nThe federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio framework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized category under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying banking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent may opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework if has average consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5 percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an advance approaches banking organization.\nThe final rule became effective January 1, 2020 and banks that meet the qualifying criteria can elect to use the community bank leverage framework starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The Company and the Bank meet the criteria outlined in the final rule and are considering whether or not to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework.\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management refers to the Company's ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations and commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner. Detailed cash flow projections are reviewed by Management on a monthly basis, with various stress scenarios applied to assess our ability to meet liquidity needs under unusual or adverse conditions. Liquidity ratios are also calculated and reviewed on a regular basis. While those ratios are merely indicators and are not measures of actual liquidity, they are closely monitored and we are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity resources to draw upon should unexpected needs arise.\nThe Company, on occasion, experiences cash needs as the result of loan growth, deposit outflows, asset purchases or liability repayments. To meet short-term needs, we can borrow overnight funds from other financial institutions, draw advances via Federal Home Loan Bank lines of credit, or solicit brokered deposits if customer deposits are not immediately\nobtainable from local sources. Availability on lines of credit from correspondent banks and the FHLB totaled $523 million at December 31, 2019. The Company was also eligible to borrow approximately $59 million at the Federal Reserve Discount Window based on pledged assets at December 31, 2019. Furthermore, funds can be obtained by drawing down excess cash that might be available in the Company's correspondent bank deposit accounts, or by liquidating unpledged investments or other readily saleable assets. In addition, the Company can raise immediate cash for temporary needs by selling under agreement to repurchase those investments in its portfolio which are not pledged as collateral. As of December 31, 2019, unpledged debt securities plus pledged securities in excess of current pledging requirements comprised $437 million of the Company's investment balances, as compared to $352 million at December 31, 2018. Other sources of potential liquidity include but are not necessarily limited to any outstanding fed funds sold and vault cash. The Company has a higher level of actual balance sheet liquidity than might otherwise be the case, since we utilize a letter of credit from the FHLB rather than investment securities for certain pledging requirements. That letter of credit, which is backed by loans pledged to the FHLB by the Company, totaled $105 million at December 31, 2019. Management is of the opinion that available investments and other potentially liquid assets, along with standby funding sources it has arranged, are more than sufficient to meet the Company's current and anticipated short-term liquidity needs.\nThe Company's net loans to assets and available investments to assets ratios were 68% and 17%, respectively, at December 31, 2019, as compared to internal policy guidelines of less than 78%\u201d and greater than 3%.\u201d Other liquidity ratios reviewed periodically by Management and the Board include net loans to total deposits and wholesale funding to total assets (including ratios and sub-limits for the various components comprising wholesale funding), which were all well within policy guidelines at December 31, 2019.\nThe holding company's primary uses of funds include operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, shareholder dividends, and stock repurchases. Its primary source of funds is dividends from the Bank, since the holding company does not conduct regular banking operations. Management anticipates that the Bank will have sufficient earnings to provide dividends to the holding company to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. Both the holding company and the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations on dividend payments, as outlined in Item 5(c) Dividends in this Form 10-K.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, nor does it have exposure to currency exchange rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk, and we have established policies and procedures to monitor and limit our earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The principal objective of interest rate risk management is to manage the financial components of the Company's balance sheet in a manner that will optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital under a variety of interest rate scenarios.\nTo identify areas of potential exposure to interest rate changes, we utilize commercially available modeling software to perform monthly earnings simulations and calculate the Company's market value of portfolio equity under varying interest rate scenarios. The model imports relevant information for the Company's financial instruments and incorporates Management's assumptions on pricing, duration, and optionality for anticipated new volumes. Various rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are then applied in order to calculate the expected effect of a given interest rate change on interest income, interest expense, and the value of the Company's financial instruments. The rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down), ramped (an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period), economic (based on current trends and econometric models) or stable (unchanged from current actual levels).\nIn addition to a stable rate scenario, which presumes that there are no changes in interest rates, we typically use at least six other interest rate scenarios in conducting our rolling 12-month net interest income simulations: upward shocks of 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points, and downward shocks of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. Those scenarios may be supplemented, reduced in number, or otherwise adjusted as determined by Management to provide the most meaningful simulations in light of economic conditions and expectations at the time. We currently utilize an additional upward rate shock scenario of 400 basis points. Pursuant to policy guidelines, we generally attempt to limit the projected decline in net interest income relative to the stable rate scenario to no more than 5% for a 100 basis point (bp) interest rate shock, 10%\nfor a 200 bp shock, 15% for a 300 bp shock, and 20% for a 400 bp shock. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile, without factoring in any potential negative impact on spreads resulting from competitive pressures or credit quality deterioration:\n\nOur current simulations indicate that the Company's net interest income will remain relatively flat over the next 12 months in a rising rate environment, but a drop in interest rates could have a substantial negative impact. In prior periods the simulations projected sizeable gains in net interest income in rising rate scenarios, but balance sheet changes such as the addition of fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans with longer reset periods, and the recent increase in interest rates have significantly diminished that effect. If there were an immediate and sustained upward adjustment of 100 basis points in interest rates, all else being equal, net interest income over the next 12 months is projected to improve by only $1.09 million, or 1.1%, relative to a stable interest rate scenario, with the favorable variance contracting very slightly as interest rates rise higher. If interest rates were to decline by 100 basis points, however, net interest income would likely be around $4.50 million lower than in a stable interest rate scenario, for a negative variance of 4.4%. The unfavorable variance increases when rates drop 200 or 300 basis points, due to the fact that certain deposit rates are already relatively low (on NOW accounts and savings accounts, for example), and will hit a natural floor of close to zero while non-floored variable-rate loan yields continue to drop. This effect is exacerbated by accelerated prepayments on fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities when rates decline, although rate floors on some of our variable-rate loans partially offset other negative pressures. While we view material interest rate reductions as unlikely in the near term, we will continue to monitor our interest rate risk profile and will apply remedial changes as deemed appropriate.\nIn addition to the net interest income simulations shown above, we run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank modeling the possibility of no balance sheet growth, the potential runoff of surge\u201d core deposits which flowed into the Bank in the most recent economic cycle, and unfavorable movement in deposit rates relative to yields on earning assets (i.e., higher deposit betas). When no balance sheet growth is incorporated and a stable interest rate environment is assumed, projected annual net interest income is about $6.4 million lower than in our standard simulation. However, the stressed simulations reveal that the Company's greatest potential pressure on net interest income would result from excessive non-maturity deposit runoff and/or unfavorable deposit rate changes in rising rate scenarios.\nThe economic value (or fair value\u201d) of financial instruments on the Company's balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. The difference between the projected fair value of the Company's financial assets and the fair value of its financial liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), and changes in EVE under different interest rate scenarios are effectively a gauge of the Company's longer-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at anticipated replacement interest rates for each account type, while the fair value of non-financial accounts is assumed to equal their book value for all rate scenarios. An economic value simulation is a static measure utilizing balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, and the measurement can change substantially over time as the Company's balance sheet evolves and interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated.\nThe change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including stated interest rates or spreads relative to current or projected market-level interest rates or spreads, the likelihood of principal prepayments, whether contractual interest rates are fixed or floating, and the average remaining time to maturity. As a general rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater the impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical patterns and Management's best estimates. Our EVE has increased in recent periods due to asset growth and higher discount rates, which result in a larger benefit assessed to non-maturity deposits. The table below shows estimated changes in the\nCompany's EVE as of December 31, 2019, under different interest rate scenarios relative to a base case of current interest rates:\n\nThe table shows that our EVE will generally deteriorate in declining rate scenarios, but should benefit from a parallel shift upward in the yield curve. The change in EVE flattens out as interest rates drop more than 200 basis points, while the rate of increase in EVE begins to taper off the higher interest rates rise. This phenomenon is caused by the relative durations of our fixed-rate assets and liabilities, combined with optionality inherent in our balance sheet. We also run stress scenarios for the unconsolidated Bank's EVE to simulate the possibility of higher loan prepayment rates, unfavorable changes in deposit rates, and higher deposit decay rates. Model results are highly sensitive to changes in assumed decay rates for non-maturity deposits, in particular, with material unfavorable variances occurring relative to the standard simulations shown above as decay rates are increased. Furthermore, while not as extreme as the variances produced by increasing non-maturity deposit decay rates, EVE also displays a relatively high level of sensitivity to unfavorable changes in deposit rate betas in rising interest rate scenarios.", "item_7_tables": "Table 58: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Key points include:\n\n- Net income increased to $36 million in 2019 from $30 million in 2018 due to higher net interest income and noninterest income. \n\n- Net interest income increased 5% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets, especially real estate and mortgage warehouse loans. Net interest margin declined slightly due to a lower rate environment.\n\n- Noninterest income increased 9% in 2019 largely due to higher bank-owned life insurance income. \n\n- Noninterest expense increased slightly in 2019 as higher costs in some areas like deposit services were offset by decreases elsewhere. \n\n- Loans grew 2% in 2019 with increases in mortgage warehouse lending offsetting declines in other loan categories. \n\n- Deposits increased 2% in 2019 driven by organic growth. \n\n- Capital levels remained strong with increases from earnings retention. Regulatory capital ratios were well above minimums for well-capitalized status.\n\n- Credit quality improved with lower nonperforming assets. Net charge-offs were minimal.\n\n- Net interest income simulations indicate moderate sensitivity to rate changes. Rising rates have limited positive impact while declining rates could pressure net interest income.\n\nOverall the report indicates Sierra Bancorp maintained strong financial performance and credit quality in 2019 while experiencing moderate loan and deposit growth. The company remains well-capitalized and liquid."}
