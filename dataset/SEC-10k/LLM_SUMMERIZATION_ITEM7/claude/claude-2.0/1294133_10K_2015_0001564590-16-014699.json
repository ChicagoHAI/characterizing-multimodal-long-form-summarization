MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Traditionally, these patients have relied on stationary oxygen concentrator systems for use in the home and oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use. The tanks and cylinders must be delivered regularly and have a finite amount of oxygen, which limits patient mobility and requires patients to plan activities outside of their homes around delivery schedules. Additionally, patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to their stationary concentrators simply to enable mobility within their homes. We refer to this traditional delivery approach as the delivery model. Our proprietary Inogen One systems are devices that concentrate the air around them to offer a single source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere. Using our portable systems, patients can eliminate their dependence on stationary concentrators and tank and cylinder deliveries, thereby improving quality-of-life and fostering mobility.\nIn May 2004, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for our Inogen One G1. From our launch of the Inogen One G1 in 2004, through 2008, we derived our revenue almost exclusively from sales to healthcare providers and distributors. In December 2008, we acquired Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC in order to secure access to the Medicare rental market and began accepting Medicare reimbursement for our oxygen solutions in certain states. At the time of the acquisition, Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC had an active Medicare billing number but few other assets and limited business activities. In January 2009, following the acquisition of Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC, we initiated our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and began selling Inogen One systems directly to patients and building our Medicare rental business in the United States. In April 2009, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our Goleta, California facility for Home/Durable Medical Equipment Services for oxygen equipment and supplies. In addition, in May 2015, we again received notice of accreditation approval from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for all six locations in which we conduct business, effective from May 8, 2015 through May 7, 2018. We believe we are the only portable oxygen concentrator manufacturer that employs a direct-to-consumer marketing strategy in the United States, meaning we advertise directly to patients, process their physician paperwork, provide clinical support as needed and bill the patient or their insurance on their behalf.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale and rental of our Inogen One systems and related accessories to patients, insurance carriers, home healthcare providers and distributors. We sell multiple configurations of our Inogen One systems with various batteries, accessories, warranties, power cords and language settings. We also rent our products to Medicare beneficiaries and patients with other insurance coverage to support their oxygen needs as prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. Our goal is to design, build and market oxygen solutions that redefine how oxygen therapy is delivered. To accomplish this goal and to grow our revenue, we intend to continue to:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Expand our sales and marketing channels. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we increased our internal sales representatives from 129 to 166. Typically, we expect new sales representatives to take 4-6 months to reach full productivity. Additionally, we are building a physician referral channel that currently consists of 14 sales representatives as of December 31, 2015 up from 12 as of December 31, 2014. Lastly, we are focused on building our international and domestic business-to-business partnerships, including relationships with distributors, key accounts, resellers, and private label partners.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Invest in our product offerings to develop innovative products. We expended $4.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in research and development expenses, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the foreseeable future. We launched our upgraded Inogen One G3 product in December 2015, which has 25% increased oxygen output (1,050 ml/minute versus 840 ml/minute previously), is less expensive to manufacture than our current Inogen One G3 product, and features improvements in sound level (from 42 dBA to 39 dBA). We also expect to launch our fourth-generation portable oxygen concentrator, the Inogen One G4, in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect this product to be smaller, lighter, and less expensive to manufacture than our Inogen One G3 product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Secure contracts with healthcare payors and insurers. Based on our patient population, we estimate that at least 30% of oxygen therapy patients are covered by non-Medicare payors, and that these patients often represent a younger, more active patient segment. By becoming an in-network provider with more insurance companies, we can reduce the patients'\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> co-insurance and deductible obligations on their oxygen services, which we believe will allow us to attract additional patients to our Inogen One and Inogen At Home solutions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have been developing and refining the manufacturing of our Inogen One systems over the past eleven years. While nearly all of our manufacturing and assembly processes were originally outsourced, assembly of the manifold, compressor, sieve bed and concentrator is now conducted in-house in order to improve quality control and reduce cost. Additionally, we use lean manufacturing practices to maximize manufacturing efficiency. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply several components of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity and quality requirements and delivery terms. In certain cases, these agreements can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. We have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, motors, valves, and some molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels and to manage component quality.\nHistorically, we have generated a majority of our revenue from sales and rentals to customers in the United States. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 22% of our total revenue was from customers outside the United States, primarily in Europe. To date, most of our revenue has been denominated in United States dollars. Approximately 54% of the non-U.S. revenue for 2015 was invoiced in Euros. The Company did not begin to invoice in Euros until the first quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside the United States through distributors or directly to large house\u201d accounts, which include gas companies and home oxygen providers. In those instances, we sell to and bill the distributor or house\u201d accounts directly, leaving responsibility for the patient billing, support and clinical setup to the local provider.\nOur total revenue increased $46.5 million to $159.0 million in 2015 from $112.5 million in 2014, primarily due to growth in sales revenue associated with the increases in business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems, and growth in rental revenue associated with an increase in the number of patients using Medicare or private payors to rent our products. We generated net income of $11.6 million in 2015 and net income of $6.8 million in 2014. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $32.3 million and $24.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). Adjusted net income was $10.0 million for 2015, compared to Adjusted net income of $6.6 million in 2014 (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $45.1 million.\nSales revenue\nOur future financial performance will be driven in part by the growth in sales of our Inogen One systems, and, to a lesser extent, sales of batteries, other accessories, and sales of our Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrators. We plan to grow our system sales in the coming years through multiple strategies, including: expanding our direct-to-consumer sales efforts through hiring additional sales representatives, investing in consumer awareness, expanding our sales infrastructure and efforts outside of the United States, expanding our business-to-business sales through key partnerships, and enhancing our product offerings through additional product launches. As our product offerings grow, we solicit feedback from our customers and focus our research and development efforts on continuing to improve patient preference and reduce the total cost of the product, in order to further drive sales of our products.\nOur direct-to-consumer sales process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff, and includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, including procuring an oxygen prescription. The patient may consider whether to finance the product through an Inogen-approved third-party or purchase the equipment. Product is not deployed until both the prescription and payment are received. Once product is deployed, the patient has 30 days to return the product, subject to the payment of a minimal processing and handling fee. Approximately 10% of consumers who purchase a system return the system during this 30-day return period.\nOur business-to-business efforts are focused on selling to home medical equipment distributors, oxygen providers, resellers, and private label partners who are based inside and outside of the United States. This process involves interactions with various key customer stakeholders, including sales, purchasing, product testing, and clinical personnel. Businesses that have patient demand that can be met with our oxygen concentrator systems place purchase orders to secure product deployment. This may be influenced based on outside factors, including the result of tender offerings, changes in insurance plan coverage, and overall changes in the net oxygen therapy patient population. Products are shipped freight on board (FOB) Inogen dock domestically, and based on financial history and profile, businesses may either prepay or receive extended terms. Products are shipped both FOB Inogen dock and DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) for certain international shipments depending on the shipper used. DDP shipments are Inogen's property until title has changed, which is upon duty being paid. As a result of these factors, product purchases can be subject to changes in demand by customers.\nWe sold 56,600 systems in 2015, 33,200 systems in 2014 and 19,200 in 2013. Management focuses on system sales as an indicator of current business success.\nRental revenue\nOur direct-to-consumer rental process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff. The process includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, and their medical history to confirm the appropriateness of our product for the patient's oxygen therapy and compliance with Medicare and private payor billing requirements, which often necessitates additional physician evaluation and/or testing as well as a Certificate of Medical Necessity. Once the product is deployed, the patient receives direction on product use and receives a clinical titration from our licensed staff to confirm the product meets the patient's medical oxygen needs prior to billing. As a result, the time from initial contact with a customer to billing can vary significantly and be up to one month or longer.\nWe plan to grow our rental revenue in the coming years through multiple strategies, including expanding our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts through hiring additional sales representatives and investing in patient and physician awareness, securing additional insurance contracts and continuing to enhance our product offerings through additional product launches. In addition, patients may come off of our services due to death, a change in their condition, a change in location, a change in provider or other factors. In each case, we maintain asset ownership and can redeploy assets as appropriate following such events. Given the length and uncertainty of our patient acquisition cycle and potential returns we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, there may be fluctuations in our net new patient setups on a period-to-period basis.\nAs the rental patient base increases, this rental model generates recurring revenue with minimal additional sales and general and administrative expenses. A portion of rentals include a capped rental period when no additional reimbursement will be allowed unless additional criteria are met. In this scenario, the ratio of billable patients to patients on service is critical to maintaining rental revenue growth as patients on service increases. Medicare has noted a certain percentage of beneficiaries, approximately 25%, based on their review of Medicare claims, reach the 36th month and enter the capped rental period. Our capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service was approximately 14.1% as of December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than the capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service of approximately 13.5% as of December 31, 2014. The percentage of capped patients may fluctuate over time as new patients come on service, patients come off of service before and during the capped rental period, and existing patients enter the capped rental period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 32,800 oxygen rental patients, an increase from 28,400 oxygen rental patients as of December 31, 2014. Management focuses on rental revenue as an indicator of current business success and a leading indicator of likely future rental revenue; however, actual rental revenue recognized is subject to a variety of other factors, including reimbursement levels by payor, patient zip code, the number of capped patients, write-offs for uncollectable balances, and adjustments for patients in transition.\nReimbursement\nWe rely heavily on reimbursement from Medicare, and secondarily from private payors, Medicaid and patients, for our rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 73.7% of our rental revenue was derived from Medicare's service reimbursement programs. The U.S. list price for our stationary oxygen rentals (HCPCS E1390) is $260 per month and for our oxygen generating portable equipment (OGPE) rentals (HCPCS E1392) is $70 per month. The current standard Medicare allowable effective January 1, 2016 now varies by state instead of the one national standard allowable for previous years. The national standard allowable in 2015 for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) was $180.92 per month and for OGPE rentals (E1392) was $51.63 per month. Effective January 1, 2016 the standard Medicare allowables for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $135.14 to $145.61 per month and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $46.69 to $49.52 per month. These are the two primary codes that we bill to Medicare and other payors for our oxygen product rentals. These rates are subject to additional cuts effective July 1, 2016, per competitive bidding guidelines. Those rates have not been announced yet and are subject to the pricing established under the re-bid of round two competitive bidding areas, including any potential adjustments associated with competitive bidding round two re-compete.\nAs of January 1, 2011, Medicare has phased in a program called competitive bidding. Competitive bidding impacts the amount Medicare reimburses suppliers of durable medical equipment rentals, including portable oxygen concentrators. The program is defined geographically, with suppliers submitting bids to provide medical equipment for a specific product category within that geography. Once bids have been placed, an individual company's bids across products within the category are aggregated and weighted by each product's market share in the category. The weighted-average price is then indexed against competitors. Medicare determines a clearing price\u201d out of these weighted-average prices at which sufficient suppliers have indicated they will support patients in the category, and this threshold is typically designed to generate theoretical supply that is twice the expected demand. Bids for each modality among the suppliers that made the cut are then arrayed to determine what Medicare will reimburse for each product category and geographic area. The program has strict anti-collusion guidelines to ensure bidding is truly competitive. Competitive bidding\ncontracts last up to three years once implemented, after which they are subject to a new round of bidding. Discounts off the standard Medicare allowable occur in competitive bidding Metropolitan Statistical Areas where contracts have been awarded as well as in cases where private payors pay less than this allowable. Competitive bidding rates are based on the zip code where the patient resides. Rental revenue includes payments for product, disposables, and customer service/support. As of January 1, 2016, competitive bidding was nationalized. All areas previously not subject to bidding had rate reductions applied instead of doing another bidding process. The fee schedules in the un-bid areas are adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts for areas already under competitive bidding. The regional prices are limited by a national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) and a floor (90% of the average regional prices). Since January 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates for these un-bid areas (with dates of services from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016) are based on 50% of the un-adjusted (current) fee schedule amount and 50% of the adjusted (reduced) fee schedule amount which is based on the regional competitive bidding rates. Starting on July 1, 2016, reimbursement rates will be 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount which will be based on regional competitive bidding rates.\nThe regions are defined as follows:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> Region Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> States Covered\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Far West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CA, NV, OR, WA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Great Lakes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IL, IN, MI, OH, WI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mideast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New England\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CT, MA, NH, RI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IA, KS, MN, MO, NE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rocky Mountain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CO, ID, UT\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Southeast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, NC, SC, TN, VA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Southwest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AZ, NM, OK, TX\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines frontier states as states where more than 50% of the counties in the state have a population density of 6 people or less per square mile and rural states are defined as states where more than 50% of the population lives in rural areas per census data. Current frontier states include MT, ND, SD and WY; rural states include ME, MS, VT and WV; and non-contiguous United States areas include AK, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. For frontier and rural states, and frontier and rural zip codes in non-frontier/rural states, the single payment amount will be the national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) to account for higher servicing costs in these areas. For non-contiguous United States areas, single payment amounts will be the higher of the national ceiling, or the average of competitive bidding pricing from these areas, if the areas had been bid through competitive bidding. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population.\nCMS has also re-bid for competitive bidding round two re-compete, associated with approximately 50% of the Medicare market with contracts set to begin July 1, 2016 and continue through December 31, 2018. CMS updated the product categories and the competitive bidding areas. Respiratory equipment includes oxygen, oxygen equipment, continuous positive airway pressure devices, respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories. Nebulizers are now their own separate product category instead of being included in the respiratory equipment category. Round two re-compete is in the same geographic areas that were included in the original round two. However, as a result of the Office of Management and Budget's updates to the original 91 round two metropolitan statistical areas, there are now 90 metropolitan statistical areas for round two re-compete and 117 competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Any CBA that was previously located in multi-state metropolitan statistical areas was redefined so that no CBA is included in more than one state. The round two re-compete competitive bidding areas have nearly the same zip codes as the round two competitive bidding areas; the associated changes in the zip codes since competitive bidding was implemented are reflective in this round two re-compete. Pricing is expected to be announced in winter 2016 according to CMS, and will impact both the zip codes covered under round two and also the rates for the un-bid areas effective July 1, 2016.\nCMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Bids were due by December 16, 2015. In round one 2017, there are 9 metropolitan statistical areas and 13 CBAs to make sure each CBA does not cross state boundaries. We estimate approximately 9% of the Medicare market will be impacted by these contracts set to begin January 1, 2017 and continue through December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the current Medicare standard allowable reimbursement rates and the weighted-average reimbursement rates applicable in Metropolitan Statistical Areas covered by rounds one and two of competitive bidding. The round one re-compete was completed in the same Metropolitan Statistical Areas as round one for the next three-year period starting January 1, 2014 when the original contracts expired.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Round one\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Round two\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> re-compete\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> weighted-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> weighted-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7/1/13-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/1/14-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E1390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E1392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 133.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to reducing the Medicare reimbursement rates in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the competitive bidding program has effectively reduced the number of oxygen suppliers that can participate in the Medicare program. We believe that more than 75% of existing oxygen suppliers were eliminated in round one of competitive bidding, which was implemented January 1, 2011 in 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Round two of competitive bidding was implemented July 1, 2013 in 91 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and we believe the impact on the number of oxygen suppliers was similar to round one. We believe that 59% of the market was covered by round one and round two of competitive bidding.\nCumulatively in rounds one, two and round one re-compete, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the competitive bidding areas and products for which we submitted bids. However, there is no guarantee that we will garner additional market share as a result of these contracts. The contracts include products that may require us to subcontract certain services or products to third parties, which must be approved by CMS.\nFollowing round one of competitive bidding, we were excluded from the Kansas City-MO-KS, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, and Orlando-Kissimmee-FL competitive bidding areas and Honolulu-Hawaii, where we have never maintained a license. After round one re-compete of competitive bidding, we gained access to Kansas City-MO-KS and were excluded from the following competitive bidding areas: Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor-OH, Cincinnati-Middletown-OH, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, Orlando-Kissimmee-FL, Pittsburg-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. After round two of competitive bidding, we were excluded from an additional 10 competitive bidding areas, including Akron-OH, Cape Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota-FL, Ocala, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL and Toledo-OH. Collectively, we have incrementally lost access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market as of July 1, 2013. As a result, on a going forward basis we will continue to have access to approximately 90% of the Medicare market based on our analysis of the 92 competitive bidding areas that we have won out of the 109 competitive bidding areas, representing 59% of the market, with the remaining 41% of the market not subject to competitive bidding rounds and instead in these areas the rates are applied as discussed above. The incremental loss of access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our rental business. Medicare revenue, including patient co-insurance and deductible obligations, represented 21.0% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect the decline in total revenue resulting from the loss of competitive bidding contracts in the areas that we were excluded from to be partially offset by the grandfathering\u201d of existing Medicare patients, direct sales to former Medicare patients with third-party insurance coverage, or Medicare patients paying out-of-pocket to purchase our products. Our revenue from Medicare in the 17 competitive bidding areas where we were not offered contracts was approximately $0.5 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014.\nUnder the Medicare competitive bidding program, providers may grandfather\u201d existing patients on service up to the implementation date of the competitive bidding program. This means providers may retain all existing patients and continue to receive reimbursement for them so long as the new reimbursement rate is accepted and the applicable beneficiary chooses to continue to receive equipment from the provider. Providers must either keep or release all patients under this grandfathering\u201d arrangement in each competitive bidding area; specific individual selection of patients for retention or release is not allowed. Providers can continue to sell equipment in competitive bid areas where they were not awarded contracts to patients paying out-of-pocket or with third-party insurance coverage.\nWe have elected to grandfather\u201d and retain all patients in competitive bid areas where contracts were not awarded to us. In addition, we continue to accept patients in competitive bidding areas where we did not receive contracts through private insurance. We also pursue retail sales of our equipment to patients in those areas.\nMedicare reimbursement for oxygen rental equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month period and the equipment is always owned by the home oxygen provider. The provider that billed Medicare for the 36th month continues to be responsible for the patient's oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and there is generally no additional reimbursement for oxygen generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse suppliers for oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the patient. The provider is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases CMS will reimburse for repair costs. After the five year useful life is reached, the patient may request replacement equipment and, if he or she can be re-qualified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle out of the next 60 months of service would begin. The provider may not arbitrarily issue new equipment. We have analyzed the potential impact to revenue associated with patients in the capped rental period and have deferred $0 associated with the capped rental period for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur obligations to service assigned Medicare patients over the contract rental period include supplying working equipment that meets the patient's oxygen needs pursuant to their doctor's prescription and certificate of medical necessity form and supplying all disposables required for the patient to operate the equipment, including cannulas, filters, replacement batteries, carts and carry bags, as needed. If the equipment malfunctions, we must repair or replace the equipment. We determine what equipment the patient receives, and we can deploy existing used assets as long as the prescription requirements are met. We must also procure a recertification certificate of medical necessity from the patient's doctor to confirm the patient's need for oxygen therapy one year after first receiving oxygen therapy and one year after each new 36-month reimbursement period begins. These contracts are cancellable by the patient at any time and by the provider at any time as long as the patient can transition to another provider.\nIn addition to the adoption of the competitive bidding program, reimbursable fees for oxygen rental services in non-competitive bidding areas were eligible to receive mandatory annual Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U, updates beginning in 2010. For 2014, the CPI-U was +1.8%, but the multi-factor productivity adjustment, adjustment\u201d, was -0.8%, so the net result was a 1.0% increase in fee schedule payments in 2014 for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. However, the stationary oxygen equipment codes payment amounts, as required by statute, must be adjusted on an annual basis, as necessary, to ensure budget neutrality of the new payment class for oxygen generating portable equipment. Thus, the increase in allowable payment amounts for stationary oxygen equipment codes increased 0.5% from 2013 to 2014. For 2015, the CPI-U was +2.1%, but the adjustment was -0.6%, so the net result was a 1.5% increase in fee schedule payments in 2015 for stationary oxygen equipment for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. This does not apply for 2016 as the standard allowables were set for each state based on regional averages of the competitive bidding prices as described previously.\nIn addition, the President's proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2017 includes multiple provisions that could impact the Company if they were enacted. The budget proposed eliminating the 36-month cap for oxygen equipment, and reducing the monthly payment amount for oxygen and oxygen equipment by the necessary percentage to be budget neutral. The Company's patient population may materially differ from the Medicare population, which could lead to either more or less revenue if this is enacted. In addition, this would likely also impact the number of patients interested in a cash purchase and could increase rental patients and decrease out-of-pocket purchases. The proposed budget also proposes to extend the authority to require prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items and services, particularly those that are at the highest risk for improper payment. The proposed budget also contains multiple provisions related to the Medicare appeals process including establishing a refundable filing fee (non-refundable if denied), providing the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and Department Appeals Board Authority to use Recover Audit Contractor collections, and increase minimum amount in controversy for administrative law judge adjudication of claims to equal the amount required for judicial review. In addition, this proposal includes the ability to remand appeals to the redetermination level with the introduction of new evidence and the ability to sample and consolidate similar claims for administrative efficiency.\nA ruling from CMS has outlined the expansion of competitive bidding to certain previously unbid areas by applying regional pricing averages to unbid areas with 110% of regional prices to be paid for defined rural and frontier areas. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016. Medicare was 21.0% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, and we estimate that 41% of the Medicare markets will be subject to this reimbursement reduction. We also estimate that on average the rates will be reduced by 35-40% in these areas. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population. CMS has also re-bid the round two re-compete for contracts from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. CMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. For additional discussion of the impact of the recent competitive bidding proposals, see Risk Factors\u201d herein.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 79 contracts with Medicaid and private payors. These contracts qualify us as an in-network provider for these payors. As a result, patients can rent or purchase our systems at the same patient obligation as other in-network\noxygen providers. Based on our patient population, we believe at least 30% of all oxygen therapy patients are covered by private payors. Private payors typically provide reimbursement at 60% to 100% of Medicare allowables for in-network plans, and private payor plans can have 36-month capped rental periods similar to Medicare although they typically do not. We anticipate that private payor reimbursement levels will generally be reset in accordance with Medicare payment amounts established through competitive bidding.\nWe cannot predict the full extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by competitive bidding or by initiatives to reduce costs for private payors. We believe that we are well positioned to respond to the changing reimbursement environment because our product offerings are innovative, patient-focused and cost-effective. We have historically been able to reduce our costs through scalable manufacturing, better sourcing, continuous innovation, and reliability improvements, as well as innovations that reduce our product service costs by minimizing exchanges, such as user replaceable batteries and oxygen filtration cartridges. As a result of bringing manufacturing and assembly largely in-house and our commitment to driving efficient manufacturing processes, we have reduced our overall system cost by 45% from 2009 to 2015. We intend to continue to seek ways to reduce our cost of revenue through manufacturing and design improvements.\nBasis of presentation\nThe following describes the line items set forth in our Statements of Operations.\nRevenue\nWe classify our revenue in two main categories: sales revenue and rental revenue. There will be fluctuations in mix between business-to-business sales, direct-to-consumer sales and rentals from period to period. Inogen One system and Inogen At Home system selling prices and gross margins for our systems may fluctuate as we introduce new products, reduce our product costs, have changes in purchase volumes, and as currency variations occur. For example, the gross margin for our Inogen One G3 is higher than our Inogen One G2 due to lower manufacturing costs and similar average selling prices. Thus, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G3 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G2 systems, our overall gross margins should improve and, conversely, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G2 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G3 systems, our overall gross margins should decline. Quarter over quarter results may vary due to seasonality in both the international and domestic markets. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months.\nSales revenue\nOur sales revenue is derived from the sale of our Inogen One systems, Inogen At Home systems, and related accessories to patients in the United States and to home healthcare providers, distributors, private label partners and resellers worldwide. Sales revenue is classified into two areas: business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, business-to-business sales as a percentage of total sales revenue were 61.4%, 59.9% and 60.4%, respectively. Generally, our direct-to-consumer sales have higher gross margins than our business-to-business sales.\nWe also offer a lifetime warranty for direct-to-consumer sales. For a fixed price, we agree to provide a fully functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. Lifetime warranties are only offered to patients upon the initial sale of oxygen equipment by us and are non-transferable. Product sales with lifetime warranties are considered to be multiple element arrangements within the scope of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-25-Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements.\nThere are two deliverables when a product that includes a lifetime warranty is sold. The first deliverable is the oxygen concentrator equipment which comes with a standard warranty of three years. The second deliverable is the lifetime warranty that provides for a functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. These two deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting.\nThe revenue is allocated to the two deliverables on a relative selling price method. We have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price for the equipment. To determine the selling price of the lifetime warranty, we use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable as the lifetime warranty is neither separately priced nor is selling price available through third-party evidence. To calculate the selling price associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall business, the average estimated cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties. A significant estimate used to calculate the price and expense of lifetime warranties is the life expectancy of patients. Based on clinical studies, we estimate that 60% of patients will succumb to their disease within three years. Given the approximate mortality rate of 20% per year, we estimate on average all patients will succumb to their disease within five years. We have taken into consideration that when patients decide to buy an Inogen\nportable oxygen concentrator with a lifetime warranty, they typically have already been on oxygen for a period of time, which can have a large impact on their life expectancy from the time our product is deployed.\nAfter applying the relative selling price method, revenue from equipment sales is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria for product sales are met. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred for the first three years and is recognized using the straight-line method during the fourth and fifth year after the delivery of the equipment which is the estimated usage period of the contract based on the average patient life expectancy.\nFreight revenue consists of fees associated with the deployment of products internationally or domestically, when expedited freight options or minimum order quantities are not met. Freight revenue is a percentage markup of freight costs.\nRental revenue\nOur rental revenue is primarily derived from the rental of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to patients through reimbursement from Medicare, private payors and Medicaid, which typically also includes a patient responsibility component for patient co-insurance and deductibles. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates due to the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines and increases in capped patients on service.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840 - Leases. We have a separate contract with each patient that is not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. The lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month. Included in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not billed. The estimate of unbilled rental revenue accrual is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nCost of revenue\nCost of sales revenue\nCost of sales revenue consists primarily of costs incurred in the production process, including costs of component materials, assembly labor and overhead, warranty, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, rework and delivery costs for items sold. Labor and overhead expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for manufacturing, logistics, repair, quality assurance, and facility costs. They also include manufacturing freight in, materials, temporary labor, outside services, consulting, and depreciation expense. We provide a three-year or lifetime warranty on Inogen One systems sold and a three-year warranty on Inogen At Home systems sold. We established a reserve for warranty repairs based on historical warranty repair costs incurred. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are provided for at the time of shipment.\nWe expect the average unit costs of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to continue to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to develop lower-cost systems and to improve our manufacturing processes, and increase production volume and yields.\nCost of rental revenue\nCost of rental revenue consists primarily of depreciation expense and service costs for rental patients, including rework costs, material, labor, freight, consumable disposables and logistics costs.\nWe expect the average rental service costs per patient to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce logistics costs, material, labor and depreciation.\nOperating expense\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for research and development and engineering employees, allocated facility costs, laboratory supplies, product development materials, consulting fees and related costs, and testing costs for new product launches. We have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception. Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to enhance our technologies and to support development and commercialization of new and existing products. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the upcoming Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expense primarily supports our direct-to-consumer strategy. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation for sales, marketing, customer service and clinical service employees, and allocated facilities costs. They also include expenses for media and advertising, printing, informational kits, dues and fees, including credit card fees, sales promotional and marketing activities, travel and entertainment expenses as well as customer service and clinical services. Sales and marketing expenses increased throughout 2014 and 2015, primarily due to an increase in the sales force and the increasing number of rental patients, and we expect a further increase in 2016 as we continue to increase sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees in our compliance, finance, medical billing, human resources, information technology, business development and general management functions, consulting fees, facilities costs, bad debt expense, and board of directors expenses, including stock-based compensation. In addition, general and administrative expense includes professional services, such as legal, patent registration and defense costs, insurance, consulting and accounting services, including audit and tax services, and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as the number of administrative personnel grows and we continue to introduce new products, broaden our customer base and grow our business. We also expect legal, accounting and compliance costs to increase due to costs associated with being a public company.\nOther income (expense), net\nOur other income (expense), net consisted primarily of foreign currency translation losses in 2015, interest expense related to our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 and 2013, and interest income driven by the interest accruing on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Other income (expense), net also includes the change in valuation of warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo valuation model in 2014.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on income taxes, if any, within income tax provision (benefit). No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31,\n2015, we had federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize these carryforwards could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on our federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nResult of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales revenue increased $40.5 million to $113.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 55.4% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 23,400 unit increase in the number of oxygen systems sold. We sold 56,600 oxygen systems during the year ended December 31, 2015, or an increase of 70.5% over the comparable year. The increase in the number of systems sold in 2015 included sales of the new Inogen At Home stationary system that was first introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nRental revenue increased $5.9 million to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.1% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net rental patients to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 from 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. The net patient increase was primarily attributable to additional marketing efforts, increased sales personnel and productivity improvements, partially offset by an increase in the minimum requirements for available billable months for new rental customers. In addition, rental revenue adjustments came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by region and category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business international sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic sales in both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer increased 78.0% and 49.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in domestic business-to-business sales was primarily the result of increased demand from our private label distributor (which began in the first quarter of 2015) and resellers, as well as increased consumer demand for our products due to our marketing efforts and the marketing efforts of our business partners. The increase in direct-to-consumer sales was primarily due to the hiring of the additional internal sales representatives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015, our expansion of marketing strategies, and our continued focus on direct-to-consumer sales with more selective new rental customer set-ups. In addition, the new Inogen At Home stationary system was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 which added additional sales in 2015 versus 2014.\nBusiness-to-business international sales increased 44.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to continued demand in Europe and partially due to the approval of our Inogen One G3 system for reimbursement in France and Germany in the second half of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we plan to continue to expand our presence in other countries as additional opportunities are cultivated. Of our international sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, 89.5% was in Europe, compared to 87.6% in the comparative period in 2014.\nOur rental revenue increase was primarily attributable to the net 15.5% increase in the number patients on service to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 versus 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, rental revenue adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the number of unbilled patients in the capped period increased to 14.1% as of December 31, 2015 from 13.5% as of December 31, 2014, for which $0 revenue was recognized for these patients.\nIn future periods, revenue may be impacted by seasonality resulting in higher sales in the warmer weather spring and summer months due to patients traveling in those periods and lower revenue in the low travel and colder weather months. We also will be impacted by lower Medicare and third-party reimbursement rates, including competitive bidding, the number of sales representatives, the level of and response from potential customers to direct-to-consumer marketing spend, the number and demand of business-to-business partners and distributors, other uncontrollable factors such as changes in the market and competition. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates in connection with the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage- rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manufacture our products in our Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas facilities. Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to quality and customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $22.9 million to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 59.1% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material costs for our products associated with design changes, better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales revenue as a percentage of sales revenue in future periods to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $2.9 million to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.6% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental asset depreciation, repair costs, disposables, product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of rental revenue included $12.0 million of rental asset depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin decreased to 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in sales revenue gross margin was primarily related to a shift in sales mix towards lower margin business-to-business customer sales domestically versus direct-to-consumer sales which carry higher gross margins. The increased demand from domestic business-to-business channels was primarily the result of the introduction of private label sales intended to increase volume and market share at lower average selling prices, increased reseller demand, and strategic price concessions in our business-to-business channels worldwide primarily due to increased volume and currency fluctuations. While the change in mix drove higher total sales revenue, there was an overall 8.8% decline in revenue per sales unit, which had a negative impact on gross margin. This was partially offset by a decrease in overall sales cost of goods sold per unit sold of 6.7%, largely driven by lower material and freight costs.\nRental revenue gross margin decreased slightly to 53.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014, largely due to slight declines in net rental revenue per patient.\nThe overall gross margin decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decline was consistent with the overall mix of sales and rental revenue as discussed above.\nResearch and development expense\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense increased $1.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 40.4% over the prior year. As a percent of revenue, research and development expense was essentially flat at 2.6% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses for engineering projects and $0.3 million for product development expense.\nWe expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the new Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing expense\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense increased $7.3 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 30.2% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to $4.4 million of sales and marketing personnel-related expenses as a result of increased headcount to support the growth of our business (which included $2.3 million of wages and payroll tax expense, $0.8 million of commissions and bonus expense, and $0.6 million additional stock compensation expense), $0.9 million of additional media/printing expenses and $0.8 million in higher credit card processing fees. We also incurred an additional $0.7 million in personnel-related costs for our client services and clinical teams as well as $0.3 million for non-warranty repair costs.

Value added tax (VAT) was also paid in Euros upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed so was subject to Euro currency translation losses. Fluctuations in the Euro currency to the U.S. dollar exchange rate as well as the decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement compared to prior year resulted in a decrease in net other expense in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to tax benefit adjustments of $1.6 million mainly related to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to California net operating losses recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and an increase in equity compensation deductions.

The increase was attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold primarily related to expansion of the Inogen One G3 product line, an increase in direct-to-consumer sales in the United States due to increased sales and marketing efforts, and an increase in business-to-business sales worldwide as the adoption of portable oxygen concentrators improved. As we expected, the growth in sales revenue was not materially impacted by the reduced reimbursement rates resulting from competitive bidding.\nRental revenue increased $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 29.2% over the comparable year. The increase was attributable to the increase in rental patients to 28,400 as of December 31, 2014 from 21,300 as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to additional marketing efforts and increased sales personnel. This increase was partially offset by the reduced reimbursement rates resulting from round two competitive bidding that became effective on July 1, 2013 and round one re-compete competitive bidding that became effective January 1, 2014.\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by region and category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business international sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic sales in business-to-business and direct-to-consumer increased 87.2% and 64.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in domestic business-to-business sales was a result of increased consumer demand for our products due to the hiring of the additional internal sales representatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, our marketing efforts and the marketing efforts of our partners. The increase in direct-to-consumer sales was primarily a result of our additional internal sales representative hires, our refocus on direct-to-consumer sales versus rental set-ups, and strong consumer demand for our products.\nThe business-to-business international sales increased 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to continued strong demand primarily in Europe and partially due to the approval of our Inogen One G3 system for reimbursement in France and Germany in the second half of 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we sold our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we plan to continue to expand our presence in other countries as the opportunities present themselves.

Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $14.4 million to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 59.2% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material and labor and overhead costs for our products associated with better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $6.2 million to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 50.9% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental assets, depreciation and product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of\nrental revenue included $10.3 million of rental asset depreciation for year ended December 31, 2014 versus $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin increased to 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 45.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales revenue gross margin was partially due to increased sales mix toward our higher margin Inogen One G3 as compared to our Inogen One G2, and the continued shift towards direct-to-consumer sales revenue in our revenue mix. Rental revenue gross margin decreased to 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 60.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to lower rental reimbursement rates resulting from round two competitive bidding that became effective July 1, 2013 and round one re-compete competitive bidding that became effective January 1, 2014. The overall gross margin decreased to 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014, which was driven by the decrease in average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 compared to the prior year. Other income, net, in 2013 was primarily associated with investment income received in connection with the sale of our interest in our former product liability insurance company. This other income was not expected to recur in future periods. Other expense, net, in 2014 consisted primarily of loss on foreign currency transactions related to the import of our goods into the European Union. Value added tax (VAT) was paid upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed in Euros. Fluctuations in the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate resulted in a net expense. The increase in preferred stock warrant liability was due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrants outstanding through a Monte Carlo valuation model due to higher enterprise value and the increased likelihood of an initial public offering during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,587\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -114.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -28.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -561.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the change in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2013.

In December of 2013, the Company evaluated its facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release valuation allowances, which created a tax benefit adjustment of $21.8 million.\nNet income\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18,609\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -73.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net income for the year ended 2014 compared to the year ended 2013 primarily related to the release of valuation allowances, which created a tax benefit adjustment of $21.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. These tax benefits were partially offset by an increase in income before provision (benefit) for income taxes to $10.1 million in 2014 compared to $3.8 million in 2013.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our sales may be impacted by seasonal factors. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months.

In addition, we held $16.8 million in certificates of deposits which had maturities greater than ninety days, but less than twelve months, and which were classified as short-term investments. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, from borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million debt outstanding in patent licensing debt. Since inception, we have received net proceeds of $91.7 million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock and $52.5 million ($49.7 million net proceeds) in connection with the sale of common stock in our initial public offering.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15.0 million working capital revolving line of credit and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three-year working capital revolving line of credit which replaced the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica Bank. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25%.\nPursuant to the revolving credit agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants relating to our net worth and EBITDA. Tangible net worth under the revolving credit agreement is calculated by subtracting the sum of intangible assets and total liabilities from total assets. EBITDA is defined in the revolving credit agreement as our net income plus interest expense, plus depreciation expense, plus amortization expense, plus income tax expense, plus non-cash expense, plus extraordinary losses, minus non-cash income, and minus extraordinary gains, as computed during certain test periods provided in the revolving credit agreement. We are required to maintain at all times a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and EBITDA (i) of $10.0 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014 through the four-quarter test period ending March 31, 2016 and (ii) of $12.5 million for any four-quarter test period commencing with the four-quarter test period ending June 30, 2016 and continuing thereafter.\nThe agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type, including non-payment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, and bankruptcy. In the event we fail to satisfy our covenants, or otherwise go into default, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has a number of remedies, including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Certain of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2015, in order to be in compliance with the EBITDA and tangible net worth requirements, we were required to maintain $10.0 million in EBITDA for the preceding test period, and we had $32.4 million in EBITDA for that period. In addition, we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and we had a tangible net worth of $133.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $15.0 million in available debt capacity under the revolving facility.\nOur principal uses of cash in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the funding of our capital expenditures including additional rental assets of $10.2 million and the net purchase of available-for-sale investments of $16.8 million. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, available borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan agreement and the cash to be generated from expected product sales and rentals, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and investing requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our\navailable financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nIf we require additional funds in the future, we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms, or at all. In the future, we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, which would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nThe following tables show a summary of our cash flows and working capital for the periods indicated:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Summary of cash flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,305\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,591\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred tax asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warranty reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nWe derive operating cash flows from cash collected from the sales and rental of our products and services. These cash flows received are partially offset by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. Net income in each period has increased associated with increased sales, improving product mix and lower costs of revenues. In addition, operating expense leverage has increased as expenses have not grown as quickly as revenues due to improved operating efficiencies. The changes in cash related to operating assets and liabilities discussed below were primarily due to the following factors that occurred across all periods: an increase in cash used related to inventory to support our growth in revenue; an increase in cash used by accounts receivable resulting from growth in rental receivables which typically have a longer collection cycle; and an increase in cash related to accounts payable resulting from the higher level of operating expenses needed to support the higher sales level.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of our net income of $11.6 million adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization of our equipment and leasehold improvements of $14.0 million, provision for rental revenue adjustments of $8.5 million, deferred tax assets of $4.8 million, provision for sales returns of $4.9 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and loss on disposal of rental units of $1.2 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $14.9 million, of which $19.0 million was due to a net increase in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets during this period, a net increase of $1.7 million in income tax receivable, partially offset by a net increase of $2.0 million of deferred revenue, $1.6 million of accounts payable, $1.2 million of accrued payroll and $0.1 million of the warranty reserve.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for each of the periods presented was primarily related to the production and purchase of rental assets, manufacturing tooling, and computer equipment and software to support our expanding business. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, net cash used in investing activities also included the net purchase of available-for-sale investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $36.6 million primarily in certificates of deposits with maturities greater than ninety days and less than twelve months that were classified as short-term investments, partially offset by $19.8 million in maturities of available-for-sale investments. In addition, we invested $10.2 million in rental assets and $2.2 million in other property, equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nWe expect to continue investing in property and equipment as we expand our operations. Our business is inherently capital intensive. For example, we expend significant manufacturing and production expense in connection with the development and production of our oxygen concentrator products and, in connection with our rental business, we incur expense in the deployment of rental products to our patients. Investments will continue to be required in order to grow our revenue.\nFinancing activities\nHistorically, we have funded our operations through our sales and rental revenue, the issuance of preferred and common stock, and the incurrence of indebtedness.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $2.3 million from the proceeds of stock options that were exercised and purchases under our employee stock purchase program. This was partially offset by $1.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements on the exercise of employee stock options and $0.3 million of payments on our contractual obligation.\nAccounts receivable\nGross accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts, rental adjustments and sales returns increased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $23.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nIncluded in accounts receivable were earned but held and unbilled receivables of $5.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays, ranging from a day to several weeks between the date of service, and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor-specific documentation from internal and external sources. Earned but held and unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from some payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. These adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review.\nManagement performs analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable. Specifically, management considers historical realization data, accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party reimbursement, it is possible that management's estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows.\nWe derive a significant portion of our rental revenue from Medicare. Revenue is recognized at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by payors and patients. Our billing system contains payor-specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect\nor contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer. For Medicare and Medicaid revenue, as well as most other third-party payors, final payment is subject to administrative review and audit. We make estimated provisions for adjustments, including adjustments from administrative review and audit, based on historical experience. We closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms in an attempt to use the most accurate information available in determining these provisions. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimates, actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record.\nCollection of rental receivables from third-party payors and patients is a significant source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid, but patient responsibility amounts (generally deductibles and co-insurance) remain outstanding. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs and aging of accounts receivable. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when all collection efforts (including payor appeals processes) have been exhausted. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical contractual adjustments and bad debt rates and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as provision for doubtful accounts.\nGross accounts receivable balance concentrations by major category as of

receivable to 23.6% as of December 31, 2015 from 16.2% as of December 31, 2014 was primarily related to the increase in patient responsibility and growth of our held and unbilled accounts receivable balances and the increased age of Medicare related receivables. We have increased billing staff to decrease past-due balances and held and unbilled to 66 as of December 31, 2015 from 52 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have implemented new collection procedures with third-party collection agencies to achieve higher collectability rates, as well as timelier payment processing from Medicare, Medicaid and third-party, payors whereby they assist with the follow-up and completion of additional requests from these payors to expedite payment. We believe our reserves are adequate and properly present the collectability of our outstanding accounts receivable balances based on our analysis of these balances. We review the accounts receivables on a monthly basis to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts, and adjust the reserves accordingly.\nThe ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months due to the time required for claims to be processed by the payors and patients, and for additional documentation to be submitted in the case of denials, which may further prolong the collection process. In addition, certain receivables are transferred to a third-party processor and we cannot anticipate the timing of those collections or whether they will be successful. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses, including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs, aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor-specific concerns. The determination that an account is uncollectible and the ultimate write-off of that account occurs once collection is considered to be highly unlikely, and it is written-off and charged to the allowance at that time.\nWe do not use an aging threshold for account receivable write-offs. However, the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted, and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write-off.\nSources of funds\nOur cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38.2 million compared to $15.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $66.1 million and available borrowing capacity under our working capital revolving line of credit of $15.0 million.\nWe believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, operating expenses and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may make material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income excluding interest income, interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and stock-based compensation. Below, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other\norganizations may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income in the same manner as we calculate these measures.\nWe include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are important measures upon which our management assesses our operating performance. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets, changes related to the fair value re-measurements of our preferred stock warrants, and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income for business planning purposes, to incentivize and compensate our management personnel, and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities.\nOur uses of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by certain expenses. When evaluating our performance, you should consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income alongside other financial performance measures, including other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>

revolving credit and term loan agreement\nIn October 2012, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement with Comerica Bank as the administrative agent, which we refer to as our Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement. This agreement incorporated amounts outstanding under one prior loan agreement whereby the existing balances and the payback terms were not changed. This transaction did not result in any debt extinguishment losses or gains. We did not incur or defer any financing cost directly related to the amended loan and security agreement.\nThe Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement also provided for a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $3.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan A, a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $8.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan B, a new term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $12.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan C, and an accounts receivable revolving line of credit amounting to up to $1.0 million based on 80% of eligible accounts receivable, which we refer to as the revolver.\nWe had borrowings of $0, $0 and $0.4 million outstanding under Term Loan A as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $3.8 million outstanding under Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $5.7 million outstanding under Term Loan C as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPayments of interest for the Term Loan were generally payable monthly. Payment of principal is payable monthly. Each term loan bears interest at the base rate, which is a rate equal to the applicable margin plus the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate, as defined in the agreement, plus 1%, and (iii) the daily adjusting LIBOR rate, plus 1%. The applicable margins for Term Loans A, B and C are 1.25%, 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively. Upon the closing of an acquisition or initial public offering during the term of the revolving credit and term loan agreement, the lenders were entitled to a fee equal to $120,000. This fee was initiated upon the close of the IPO that occurred in February, 2014, and was subsequently paid in March, 2014 and is recorded as other finance and bank fees in 2014. The Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement expired in October 2013.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15 million working capital revolving line of credit, and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three year working capital revolving line of credit which replaces the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is LIBOR plus 1.25%. We are required to maintain a tangible net worth not less than $90 million and EBITDA of $10 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014. We were in compliance as of December 31, 2015, and no outstanding debt balances were outstanding on the credit facility.\nThe revolving credit and term loan agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur\nencumbrances, make distributions to holders of our capital stock, make investments, engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, we must comply with certain financial covenants relating to liquidity, debt service, and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our obligations under the revolving credit and term loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property.\nWe may from time to time, depending upon market conditions and financing needs, seek to refinance or repurchase our debt securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nUse of funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding our new rental asset deployments and other capital purchases, operations, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments, and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, our revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, our cash flows from customer collections have increased as have our profits. As a result, our cash provided by operating activities has increased over time and now is a source of capital to the business. We expect operating activities to continue to be a source of capital to the business in the future.\nDue to the portion of our business that drives rental revenue, which needs continuing asset deployments to net new patients, our cash used in investing activities has increased over time. We expect our investment cash requirements to increase in the future as we increase our rental patient base and deploy rental assets among Medicare and private payors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to support our investing operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases - properties(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases - equipment and other(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We lease manufacturing and office space in Richardson, TX, Goleta, CA, Smyrna, TN, Huntsville, AL, Aurora, CO and Middleburg Heights, OH with terms that expire between 2017 and 2022.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> This consists of miscellaneous office and processing equipment in both Texas and California with terms expiring within 10 months to 5 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> In 2011, we entered into an amendment to a licensing agreement whereby we were assigned the entire right, title and interest in a portfolio of patents in exchange for an imputed promissory note calculated via prime plus 2 points for $0.7 million, in addition to a $0.8 million existing obligation to the original licensor, for a total of $1.5 million due to the original licensor in installments starting May 22, 2011, and ending October 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> We obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.

As of December 31, 2015, we had purchase obligations of $23.0 million of which timing of those obligations vary depending on demand, current supply on hand and other factors. The obligations normally do not extend beyond twelve month time-frames.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 million which were netted in noncurrent deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.

The\ntable does not include any payments related to liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any other payments. See Note 6 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical accounting policies and significant estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to:\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> revenue recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> stock-based compensation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> inventory and rental asset valuation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns and adjustments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales and rentals of our products. Our products consist of our proprietary line of oxygen concentrators and related accessories. A small portion of our revenue comes from extended service contracts and freight revenue for product shipments.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonable assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product. Provisions for estimated returns and discounts are made at the time of shipment. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are also provided for at the time of shipment.\nAccruals for estimated warranty expenses are made at the time that the associated revenue is recognized. We use judgment to estimate these accruals and, if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our products under warranty were greater than our estimates, our cost of revenue could be adversely affected in future periods. The provisions for estimated returns, discounts and warranty obligations are made based on known claims and discount commitments and estimates of additional returns and warranty obligations based on historical data and future expectations. We had accrued $2.0 million and $1.1 million to provide for future warranty costs at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRevenue from the sale of used rental equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured and other revenue recognition criteria are met. When a rental unit is sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gains or losses are included in gross profit.\nRevenue from the sales of our services is recognized when no significant obligations remain undelivered and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured, which is generally when risks and rewards of the product have transferred to the buyer, generally upon receipt of the product. We offer extended service contracts on our Inogen One systems for periods ranging from 12 to 24 months after the end of the standard warranty period. Revenue from extended service contracts and lifetime warranty is deferred and recognized in income over the contract period. To calculate the value associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall company, the average cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties and created a best estimate. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred and recognized after the standard three year warranty period, on a straight-line basis, in year four and five. Under the lifetime warranty, the company will provide replacement equipment without any additional cost to the consumer for the duration of the patient's life. Lifetime warranties are non-transferable.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840-Leases. We have separate contracts with each patient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. We evaluate the individual lease contracts at lease inception and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if there is reasonable assurance that the bargain renewal option associated with the potential capped free rental period would be exercised. Historically, the exercise of such bargain renewal option is not reasonably assured at lease inception and most subsequent monthly lease renewal periods. If we determine that the reasonable assurance threshold for an individual patient is met at lease inception or at a monthly lease renewal period, such determination would impact the bargain renewal period for an individual lease. We would first consider the lease classification (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease term, which may include a portion of the capped rental period. To date, we have not deferred any amounts associated with the capped rental period. Amounts related to the capped rental period have not been material in the periods presented.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received, although product was delivered and revenue was earned. Upon determination that an account is uncollectible, it is written-off and charged to the allowance. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month.\nRental revenue is recognized as earned, less estimated adjustments. Revenue not billed at the end of the period is reviewed for the likelihood of collections and accrued. The rental revenue stream is not guaranteed and payment will cease if the patient no longer needs oxygen or returns the equipment. Revenue recognized is at full estimated allowable reimbursement rates. Rental revenue is earned for that month if the patient is on service on the first day of the 30-day period commencing on the recurring date of service for a particular claim, regardless if there is a change in condition/death after that date. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services. We have determined that the balances are collectable at the time of revenue recognition because the patient signs a notice of financial responsibility outlining their obligations.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts that were earned but not able to be billed for various reasons. The criteria for recognizing revenue had been met as of period-end, but there were specific reasons why we were unable to bill Medicare and private insurance for these amounts. As a result, we create an unbilled rental revenue accrual based on these earned revenues not billed based on a percentage of unbilled amounts and historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date represents management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value, prior to the IPO, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to the IPO our common stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of the common stock as discussed in Pre-IPO Common Stock Valuations\u201d below. Following our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term for stock options granted to employees (including members of our board of directors) was estimated using the simplified method allowed under SEC guidance. For grants to non-employees, the expected term is equal to the contractual term, which have ranged from seven to ten years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. Given the limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers, which we have designated, based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have designated, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPre-IPO common stock valuations\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was approved by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share equal to the per-share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, the board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of preferred stock relative to the common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the prices of preferred stock sold to third-party investors in arms-length transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> our operating and financial performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> current business conditions and projections;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> our stage of development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> the U.S. and global capital market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants issued, we determined the enterprise value, added net cash, then allocated the equity value to each class of equity securities outstanding (preferred stock, common stock and options).\nInventory and rental asset valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, certain component parts to be used in manufacturing our products and finished goods. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, including material, labor, and manufacturing overhead, whereby the standard costs are updated at least quarterly to approximate actual costs using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value. We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete, slow-moving or impaired items. The business environment in which we operate is subject to changes in technology and customer demand. We review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components at least quarterly, taking into account product life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.\nRental assets are valued at standard cost to manufacture or purchase the product, including appropriate labor and overhead. Costs are reviewed at least quarterly to confirm standard costs approximate actual costs using the FIFO method. Rental assets are depreciated over the life of the asset, typically 18 months to 60 months. Rental asset disposals or losses are recorded at net book value in cost of rental revenue.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns, and adjustments\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that, in our opinion, is adequate to absorb potential losses related to account receivables and is based upon our continuous evaluation of the collectability of outstanding balances. Our evaluation takes into consideration such factors as past bad debt experience, economic conditions, and information about specific receivables. Our evaluation also considers the age and composition of the outstanding amount in determining their net realizable values. The allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods that they become known. The allowance is increased by bad debt provisions charged to operating expense and reduced by direct write-offs, net of recoveries. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services.\nIn general, our allowance for doubtful accounts is higher for our rental revenue compared to our sales revenue. The nature of our rental business necessitates a larger bad debt reserve against billings, as a higher percentage of our billed revenue may never be collected as a result of the failure of some patients to pay their co-insurance and deductible obligations and some billing disputes with payors.\nProvision for sales returns applies to direct-to-consumer sales only. We do not allow returns from providers. This reserve is calculated based on actual historical return rates under our 30-day return program and is applied to the current period's sales revenue for direct-to-consumer sales. We have experienced a small increase in the historical returns rate during the period, primarily due to increased competition among other providers and resellers and a slight increase in product failures in the relevant periods.\nWe also record an allowance for rental revenue adjustments and write-offs, which is recorded as a reduction of rental revenue and rental accounts receivable balances. These adjustments and write offs result from contractual adjustments, audit adjustments, or billing not paid due to another provider performing same or similar functions for the patient in the same period, all of which prevent billed revenue to become realizable. The reserve is based on historical revenue adjustments as a percentage of rental revenue billed during the related period.\nIncluded in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of $5.2 million in December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays in billing can occur between the date revenue is earned and when billing occurs due to delays in receiving the appropriate paperwork for each payor. Earned but unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability. A portion of revenue and related costs are deferred each month for monthly rental revenue based on the timing of the recurring billing and then recorded as revenue in the subsequent month.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on taxes, if any, within operations as income tax expense. No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize net operating losses could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on the federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nIn August 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Company's pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard.\nInventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\u201d thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nInterest\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this update as of the year ended December 31, 2015 with no effect to our financial statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software - Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The update provides guidance on fees paid by an entity in a cloud computing arrangement and whether an arrangement includes a license to the underlying software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the entity should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the entity should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a statement of financial position. We early-adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net noncurrent deferred tax asset in our Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The new guidance will require organizations that lease assets-referred to as lessees\u201d-to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. This will increase the reported assets and liabilities - in some cases very significantly. ASU No. 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new lease recognition guidance, and have not yet determined the impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEmerging Growth Company\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management over our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company\u201d if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively, which could result in a loss of\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for any other contractually narrow or limited purpose. However, from time to time we enter into certain types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third-party claims including certain real estate leases, supply purchase agreements, and directors and officers. The terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein. Generally, amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted thus no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheets for any of the periods presented.\nInflation\nWe experience pricing pressures in the form of continued reductions in reimbursement rates, particularly from governmental payors such as Medicare or Medicaid but also private payors. We can also be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor and employee benefits. However, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases, especially in contracts where pricing is fixed over a specific period. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Traditionally, these patients have relied on stationary oxygen concentrator systems for use in the home and oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use. The tanks and cylinders must be delivered regularly and have a finite amount of oxygen, which limits patient mobility and requires patients to plan activities outside of their homes around delivery schedules. Additionally, patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to their stationary concentrators simply to enable mobility within their homes. We refer to this traditional delivery approach as the delivery model. Our proprietary Inogen One systems are devices that concentrate the air around them to offer a single source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere. Using our portable systems, patients can eliminate their dependence on stationary concentrators and tank and cylinder deliveries, thereby improving quality-of-life and fostering mobility.\nIn May 2004, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for our Inogen One G1. From our launch of the Inogen One G1 in 2004, through 2008, we derived our revenue almost exclusively from sales to healthcare providers and distributors. In December 2008, we acquired Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC in order to secure access to the Medicare rental market and began accepting Medicare reimbursement for our oxygen solutions in certain states. At the time of the acquisition, Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC had an active Medicare billing number but few other assets and limited business activities. In January 2009, following the acquisition of Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC, we initiated our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and began selling Inogen One systems directly to patients and building our Medicare rental business in the United States. In April 2009, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our Goleta, California facility for Home/Durable Medical Equipment Services for oxygen equipment and supplies. In addition, in May 2015, we again received notice of accreditation approval from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for all six locations in which we conduct business, effective from May 8, 2015 through May 7, 2018. We believe we are the only portable oxygen concentrator manufacturer that employs a direct-to-consumer marketing strategy in the United States, meaning we advertise directly to patients, process their physician paperwork, provide clinical support as needed and bill the patient or their insurance on their behalf.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale and rental of our Inogen One systems and related accessories to patients, insurance carriers, home healthcare providers and distributors. We sell multiple configurations of our Inogen One systems with various batteries, accessories, warranties, power cords and language settings. We also rent our products to Medicare beneficiaries and patients with other insurance coverage to support their oxygen needs as prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. Our goal is to design, build and market oxygen solutions that redefine how oxygen therapy is delivered. To accomplish this goal and to grow our revenue, we intend to continue to:\n \u25cf Expand our sales and marketing channels. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we increased our internal sales representatives from 129 to 166. Typically, we expect new sales representatives to take 4-6 months to reach full productivity. Additionally, we are building a physician referral channel that currently consists of 14 sales representatives as of December 31, 2015 up from 12 as of December 31, 2014. Lastly, we are focused on building our international and domestic business-to-business partnerships, including relationships with distributors, key accounts, resellers, and private label partners. \n \u25cf Invest in our product offerings to develop innovative products. We expended $4.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in research and development expenses, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the foreseeable future. We launched our upgraded Inogen One G3 product in December 2015, which has 25% increased oxygen output (1,050 ml/minute versus 840 ml/minute previously), is less expensive to manufacture than our current Inogen One G3 product, and features improvements in sound level (from 42 dBA to 39 dBA). We also expect to launch our fourth-generation portable oxygen concentrator, the Inogen One G4, in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect this product to be smaller, lighter, and less expensive to manufacture than our Inogen One G3 product. \n \u25cf Secure contracts with healthcare payors and insurers. Based on our patient population, we estimate that at least 30% of oxygen therapy patients are covered by non-Medicare payors, and that these patients often represent a younger, more active patient segment. By becoming an in-network provider with more insurance companies, we can reduce the patients' \n co-insurance and deductible obligations on their oxygen services, which we believe will allow us to attract additional patients to our Inogen One and Inogen At Home solutions. \nWe have been developing and refining the manufacturing of our Inogen One systems over the past eleven years. While nearly all of our manufacturing and assembly processes were originally outsourced, assembly of the manifold, compressor, sieve bed and concentrator is now conducted in-house in order to improve quality control and reduce cost. Additionally, we use lean manufacturing practices to maximize manufacturing efficiency. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply several components of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity and quality requirements and delivery terms. In certain cases, these agreements can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. We have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, motors, valves, and some molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels and to manage component quality.\nHistorically, we have generated a majority of our revenue from sales and rentals to customers in the United States. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 22% of our total revenue was from customers outside the United States, primarily in Europe. To date, most of our revenue has been denominated in United States dollars. Approximately 54% of the non-U.S. revenue for 2015 was invoiced in Euros. The Company did not begin to invoice in Euros until the first quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside the United States through distributors or directly to large house\u201d accounts, which include gas companies and home oxygen providers. In those instances, we sell to and bill the distributor or house\u201d accounts directly, leaving responsibility for the patient billing, support and clinical setup to the local provider.\nOur total revenue increased $46.5 million to $159.0 million in 2015 from $112.5 million in 2014, primarily due to growth in sales revenue associated with the increases in business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems, and growth in rental revenue associated with an increase in the number of patients using Medicare or private payors to rent our products. We generated net income of $11.6 million in 2015 and net income of $6.8 million in 2014. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $32.3 million and $24.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). Adjusted net income was $10.0 million for 2015, compared to Adjusted net income of $6.6 million in 2014 (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $45.1 million.\nSales revenue\nOur future financial performance will be driven in part by the growth in sales of our Inogen One systems, and, to a lesser extent, sales of batteries, other accessories, and sales of our Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrators. We plan to grow our system sales in the coming years through multiple strategies, including: expanding our direct-to-consumer sales efforts through hiring additional sales representatives, investing in consumer awareness, expanding our sales infrastructure and efforts outside of the United States, expanding our business-to-business sales through key partnerships, and enhancing our product offerings through additional product launches. As our product offerings grow, we solicit feedback from our customers and focus our research and development efforts on continuing to improve patient preference and reduce the total cost of the product, in order to further drive sales of our products.\nOur direct-to-consumer sales process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff, and includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, including procuring an oxygen prescription. The patient may consider whether to finance the product through an Inogen-approved third-party or purchase the equipment. Product is not deployed until both the prescription and payment are received. Once product is deployed, the patient has 30 days to return the product, subject to the payment of a minimal processing and handling fee. Approximately 10% of consumers who purchase a system return the system during this 30-day return period.\nOur business-to-business efforts are focused on selling to home medical equipment distributors, oxygen providers, resellers, and private label partners who are based inside and outside of the United States. This process involves interactions with various key customer stakeholders, including sales, purchasing, product testing, and clinical personnel. Businesses that have patient demand that can be met with our oxygen concentrator systems place purchase orders to secure product deployment. This may be influenced based on outside factors, including the result of tender offerings, changes in insurance plan coverage, and overall changes in the net oxygen therapy patient population. Products are shipped freight on board (FOB) Inogen dock domestically, and based on financial history and profile, businesses may either prepay or receive extended terms. Products are shipped both FOB Inogen dock and DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) for certain international shipments depending on the shipper used. DDP shipments are Inogen's property until title has changed, which is upon duty being paid. As a result of these factors, product purchases can be subject to changes in demand by customers.\nWe sold 56,600 systems in 2015, 33,200 systems in 2014 and 19,200 in 2013. Management focuses on system sales as an indicator of current business success.\nRental revenue\nOur direct-to-consumer rental process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff. The process includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, and their medical history to confirm the appropriateness of our product for the patient's oxygen therapy and compliance with Medicare and private payor billing requirements, which often necessitates additional physician evaluation and/or testing as well as a Certificate of Medical Necessity. Once the product is deployed, the patient receives direction on product use and receives a clinical titration from our licensed staff to confirm the product meets the patient's medical oxygen needs prior to billing. As a result, the time from initial contact with a customer to billing can vary significantly and be up to one month or longer.\nWe plan to grow our rental revenue in the coming years through multiple strategies, including expanding our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts through hiring additional sales representatives and investing in patient and physician awareness, securing additional insurance contracts and continuing to enhance our product offerings through additional product launches. In addition, patients may come off of our services due to death, a change in their condition, a change in location, a change in provider or other factors. In each case, we maintain asset ownership and can redeploy assets as appropriate following such events. Given the length and uncertainty of our patient acquisition cycle and potential returns we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, there may be fluctuations in our net new patient setups on a period-to-period basis.\nAs the rental patient base increases, this rental model generates recurring revenue with minimal additional sales and general and administrative expenses. A portion of rentals include a capped rental period when no additional reimbursement will be allowed unless additional criteria are met. In this scenario, the ratio of billable patients to patients on service is critical to maintaining rental revenue growth as patients on service increases. Medicare has noted a certain percentage of beneficiaries, approximately 25%, based on their review of Medicare claims, reach the 36th month and enter the capped rental period. Our capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service was approximately 14.1% as of December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than the capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service of approximately 13.5% as of December 31, 2014. The percentage of capped patients may fluctuate over time as new patients come on service, patients come off of service before and during the capped rental period, and existing patients enter the capped rental period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 32,800 oxygen rental patients, an increase from 28,400 oxygen rental patients as of December 31, 2014. Management focuses on rental revenue as an indicator of current business success and a leading indicator of likely future rental revenue; however, actual rental revenue recognized is subject to a variety of other factors, including reimbursement levels by payor, patient zip code, the number of capped patients, write-offs for uncollectable balances, and adjustments for patients in transition.\nReimbursement\nWe rely heavily on reimbursement from Medicare, and secondarily from private payors, Medicaid and patients, for our rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 73.7% of our rental revenue was derived from Medicare's service reimbursement programs. The U.S. list price for our stationary oxygen rentals (HCPCS E1390) is $260 per month and for our oxygen generating portable equipment (OGPE) rentals (HCPCS E1392) is $70 per month. The current standard Medicare allowable effective January 1, 2016 now varies by state instead of the one national standard allowable for previous years. The national standard allowable in 2015 for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) was $180.92 per month and for OGPE rentals (E1392) was $51.63 per month. Effective January 1, 2016 the standard Medicare allowables for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $135.14 to $145.61 per month and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $46.69 to $49.52 per month. These are the two primary codes that we bill to Medicare and other payors for our oxygen product rentals. These rates are subject to additional cuts effective July 1, 2016, per competitive bidding guidelines. Those rates have not been announced yet and are subject to the pricing established under the re-bid of round two competitive bidding areas, including any potential adjustments associated with competitive bidding round two re-compete.\nAs of January 1, 2011, Medicare has phased in a program called competitive bidding. Competitive bidding impacts the amount Medicare reimburses suppliers of durable medical equipment rentals, including portable oxygen concentrators. The program is defined geographically, with suppliers submitting bids to provide medical equipment for a specific product category within that geography. Once bids have been placed, an individual company's bids across products within the category are aggregated and weighted by each product's market share in the category. The weighted-average price is then indexed against competitors. Medicare determines a clearing price\u201d out of these weighted-average prices at which sufficient suppliers have indicated they will support patients in the category, and this threshold is typically designed to generate theoretical supply that is twice the expected demand. Bids for each modality among the suppliers that made the cut are then arrayed to determine what Medicare will reimburse for each product category and geographic area. The program has strict anti-collusion guidelines to ensure bidding is truly competitive. Competitive bidding\ncontracts last up to three years once implemented, after which they are subject to a new round of bidding. Discounts off the standard Medicare allowable occur in competitive bidding Metropolitan Statistical Areas where contracts have been awarded as well as in cases where private payors pay less than this allowable. Competitive bidding rates are based on the zip code where the patient resides. Rental revenue includes payments for product, disposables, and customer service/support. As of January 1, 2016, competitive bidding was nationalized. All areas previously not subject to bidding had rate reductions applied instead of doing another bidding process. The fee schedules in the un-bid areas are adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts for areas already under competitive bidding. The regional prices are limited by a national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) and a floor (90% of the average regional prices). Since January 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates for these un-bid areas (with dates of services from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016) are based on 50% of the un-adjusted (current) fee schedule amount and 50% of the adjusted (reduced) fee schedule amount which is based on the regional competitive bidding rates. Starting on July 1, 2016, reimbursement rates will be 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount which will be based on regional competitive bidding rates.\nThe regions are defined as follows:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> Region Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> States Covered\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Far West\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CA, NV, OR, WA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Great Lakes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IL, IN, MI, OH, WI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mideast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New England\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CT, MA, NH, RI\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IA, KS, MN, MO, NE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rocky Mountain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> CO, ID, UT\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Southeast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, NC, SC, TN, VA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Southwest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> AZ, NM, OK, TX\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines frontier states as states where more than 50% of the counties in the state have a population density of 6 people or less per square mile and rural states are defined as states where more than 50% of the population lives in rural areas per census data. Current frontier states include MT, ND, SD and WY; rural states include ME, MS, VT and WV; and non-contiguous United States areas include AK, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. For frontier and rural states, and frontier and rural zip codes in non-frontier/rural states, the single payment amount will be the national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) to account for higher servicing costs in these areas. For non-contiguous United States areas, single payment amounts will be the higher of the national ceiling, or the average of competitive bidding pricing from these areas, if the areas had been bid through competitive bidding. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population.\nCMS has also re-bid for competitive bidding round two re-compete, associated with approximately 50% of the Medicare market with contracts set to begin July 1, 2016 and continue through December 31, 2018. CMS updated the product categories and the competitive bidding areas. Respiratory equipment includes oxygen, oxygen equipment, continuous positive airway pressure devices, respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories. Nebulizers are now their own separate product category instead of being included in the respiratory equipment category. Round two re-compete is in the same geographic areas that were included in the original round two. However, as a result of the Office of Management and Budget's updates to the original 91 round two metropolitan statistical areas, there are now 90 metropolitan statistical areas for round two re-compete and 117 competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Any CBA that was previously located in multi-state metropolitan statistical areas was redefined so that no CBA is included in more than one state. The round two re-compete competitive bidding areas have nearly the same zip codes as the round two competitive bidding areas; the associated changes in the zip codes since competitive bidding was implemented are reflective in this round two re-compete. Pricing is expected to be announced in winter 2016 according to CMS, and will impact both the zip codes covered under round two and also the rates for the un-bid areas effective July 1, 2016.\nCMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Bids were due by December 16, 2015. In round one 2017, there are 9 metropolitan statistical areas and 13 CBAs to make sure each CBA does not cross state boundaries. We estimate approximately 9% of the Medicare market will be impacted by these contracts set to begin January 1, 2017 and continue through December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the current Medicare standard allowable reimbursement rates and the weighted-average reimbursement rates applicable in Metropolitan Statistical Areas covered by rounds one and two of competitive bidding. The round one re-compete was completed in the same Metropolitan Statistical Areas as round one for the next three-year period starting January 1, 2014 when the original contracts expired.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Round one\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Round two\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> re-compete\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> weighted-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> weighted-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7/1/13-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1/1/14-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/30/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12/31/16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E1390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 95.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E1392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 133.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to reducing the Medicare reimbursement rates in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the competitive bidding program has effectively reduced the number of oxygen suppliers that can participate in the Medicare program. We believe that more than 75% of existing oxygen suppliers were eliminated in round one of competitive bidding, which was implemented January 1, 2011 in 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Round two of competitive bidding was implemented July 1, 2013 in 91 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and we believe the impact on the number of oxygen suppliers was similar to round one. We believe that 59% of the market was covered by round one and round two of competitive bidding.\nCumulatively in rounds one, two and round one re-compete, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the competitive bidding areas and products for which we submitted bids. However, there is no guarantee that we will garner additional market share as a result of these contracts. The contracts include products that may require us to subcontract certain services or products to third parties, which must be approved by CMS.\nFollowing round one of competitive bidding, we were excluded from the Kansas City-MO-KS, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, and Orlando-Kissimmee-FL competitive bidding areas and Honolulu-Hawaii, where we have never maintained a license. After round one re-compete of competitive bidding, we gained access to Kansas City-MO-KS and were excluded from the following competitive bidding areas: Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor-OH, Cincinnati-Middletown-OH, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, Orlando-Kissimmee-FL, Pittsburg-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. After round two of competitive bidding, we were excluded from an additional 10 competitive bidding areas, including Akron-OH, Cape Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota-FL, Ocala, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL and Toledo-OH. Collectively, we have incrementally lost access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market as of July 1, 2013. As a result, on a going forward basis we will continue to have access to approximately 90% of the Medicare market based on our analysis of the 92 competitive bidding areas that we have won out of the 109 competitive bidding areas, representing 59% of the market, with the remaining 41% of the market not subject to competitive bidding rounds and instead in these areas the rates are applied as discussed above. The incremental loss of access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our rental business. Medicare revenue, including patient co-insurance and deductible obligations, represented 21.0% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect the decline in total revenue resulting from the loss of competitive bidding contracts in the areas that we were excluded from to be partially offset by the grandfathering\u201d of existing Medicare patients, direct sales to former Medicare patients with third-party insurance coverage, or Medicare patients paying out-of-pocket to purchase our products. Our revenue from Medicare in the 17 competitive bidding areas where we were not offered contracts was approximately $0.5 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014.\nUnder the Medicare competitive bidding program, providers may grandfather\u201d existing patients on service up to the implementation date of the competitive bidding program. This means providers may retain all existing patients and continue to receive reimbursement for them so long as the new reimbursement rate is accepted and the applicable beneficiary chooses to continue to receive equipment from the provider. Providers must either keep or release all patients under this grandfathering\u201d arrangement in each competitive bidding area; specific individual selection of patients for retention or release is not allowed. Providers can continue to sell equipment in competitive bid areas where they were not awarded contracts to patients paying out-of-pocket or with third-party insurance coverage.\nWe have elected to grandfather\u201d and retain all patients in competitive bid areas where contracts were not awarded to us. In addition, we continue to accept patients in competitive bidding areas where we did not receive contracts through private insurance. We also pursue retail sales of our equipment to patients in those areas.\nMedicare reimbursement for oxygen rental equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month period and the equipment is always owned by the home oxygen provider. The provider that billed Medicare for the 36th month continues to be responsible for the patient's oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and there is generally no additional reimbursement for oxygen generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse suppliers for oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the patient. The provider is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases CMS will reimburse for repair costs. After the five year useful life is reached, the patient may request replacement equipment and, if he or she can be re-qualified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle out of the next 60 months of service would begin. The provider may not arbitrarily issue new equipment. We have analyzed the potential impact to revenue associated with patients in the capped rental period and have deferred $0 associated with the capped rental period for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur obligations to service assigned Medicare patients over the contract rental period include supplying working equipment that meets the patient's oxygen needs pursuant to their doctor's prescription and certificate of medical necessity form and supplying all disposables required for the patient to operate the equipment, including cannulas, filters, replacement batteries, carts and carry bags, as needed. If the equipment malfunctions, we must repair or replace the equipment. We determine what equipment the patient receives, and we can deploy existing used assets as long as the prescription requirements are met. We must also procure a recertification certificate of medical necessity from the patient's doctor to confirm the patient's need for oxygen therapy one year after first receiving oxygen therapy and one year after each new 36-month reimbursement period begins. These contracts are cancellable by the patient at any time and by the provider at any time as long as the patient can transition to another provider.\nIn addition to the adoption of the competitive bidding program, reimbursable fees for oxygen rental services in non-competitive bidding areas were eligible to receive mandatory annual Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U, updates beginning in 2010. For 2014, the CPI-U was +1.8%, but the multi-factor productivity adjustment, adjustment\u201d, was -0.8%, so the net result was a 1.0% increase in fee schedule payments in 2014 for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. However, the stationary oxygen equipment codes payment amounts, as required by statute, must be adjusted on an annual basis, as necessary, to ensure budget neutrality of the new payment class for oxygen generating portable equipment. Thus, the increase in allowable payment amounts for stationary oxygen equipment codes increased 0.5% from 2013 to 2014. For 2015, the CPI-U was +2.1%, but the adjustment was -0.6%, so the net result was a 1.5% increase in fee schedule payments in 2015 for stationary oxygen equipment for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. This does not apply for 2016 as the standard allowables were set for each state based on regional averages of the competitive bidding prices as described previously.\nIn addition, the President's proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2017 includes multiple provisions that could impact the Company if they were enacted. The budget proposed eliminating the 36-month cap for oxygen equipment, and reducing the monthly payment amount for oxygen and oxygen equipment by the necessary percentage to be budget neutral. The Company's patient population may materially differ from the Medicare population, which could lead to either more or less revenue if this is enacted. In addition, this would likely also impact the number of patients interested in a cash purchase and could increase rental patients and decrease out-of-pocket purchases. The proposed budget also proposes to extend the authority to require prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items and services, particularly those that are at the highest risk for improper payment. The proposed budget also contains multiple provisions related to the Medicare appeals process including establishing a refundable filing fee (non-refundable if denied), providing the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and Department Appeals Board Authority to use Recover Audit Contractor collections, and increase minimum amount in controversy for administrative law judge adjudication of claims to equal the amount required for judicial review. In addition, this proposal includes the ability to remand appeals to the redetermination level with the introduction of new evidence and the ability to sample and consolidate similar claims for administrative efficiency.\nA ruling from CMS has outlined the expansion of competitive bidding to certain previously unbid areas by applying regional pricing averages to unbid areas with 110% of regional prices to be paid for defined rural and frontier areas. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016. Medicare was 21.0% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, and we estimate that 41% of the Medicare markets will be subject to this reimbursement reduction. We also estimate that on average the rates will be reduced by 35-40% in these areas. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population. CMS has also re-bid the round two re-compete for contracts from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. CMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. For additional discussion of the impact of the recent competitive bidding proposals, see Risk Factors\u201d herein.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 79 contracts with Medicaid and private payors. These contracts qualify us as an in-network provider for these payors. As a result, patients can rent or purchase our systems at the same patient obligation as other in-network\noxygen providers. Based on our patient population, we believe at least 30% of all oxygen therapy patients are covered by private payors. Private payors typically provide reimbursement at 60% to 100% of Medicare allowables for in-network plans, and private payor plans can have 36-month capped rental periods similar to Medicare although they typically do not. We anticipate that private payor reimbursement levels will generally be reset in accordance with Medicare payment amounts established through competitive bidding.\nWe cannot predict the full extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by competitive bidding or by initiatives to reduce costs for private payors. We believe that we are well positioned to respond to the changing reimbursement environment because our product offerings are innovative, patient-focused and cost-effective. We have historically been able to reduce our costs through scalable manufacturing, better sourcing, continuous innovation, and reliability improvements, as well as innovations that reduce our product service costs by minimizing exchanges, such as user replaceable batteries and oxygen filtration cartridges. As a result of bringing manufacturing and assembly largely in-house and our commitment to driving efficient manufacturing processes, we have reduced our overall system cost by 45% from 2009 to 2015. We intend to continue to seek ways to reduce our cost of revenue through manufacturing and design improvements.\nBasis of presentation\nThe following describes the line items set forth in our Statements of Operations.\nRevenue\nWe classify our revenue in two main categories: sales revenue and rental revenue. There will be fluctuations in mix between business-to-business sales, direct-to-consumer sales and rentals from period to period. Inogen One system and Inogen At Home system selling prices and gross margins for our systems may fluctuate as we introduce new products, reduce our product costs, have changes in purchase volumes, and as currency variations occur. For example, the gross margin for our Inogen One G3 is higher than our Inogen One G2 due to lower manufacturing costs and similar average selling prices. Thus, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G3 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G2 systems, our overall gross margins should improve and, conversely, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G2 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G3 systems, our overall gross margins should decline. Quarter over quarter results may vary due to seasonality in both the international and domestic markets. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months.\nSales revenue\nOur sales revenue is derived from the sale of our Inogen One systems, Inogen At Home systems, and related accessories to patients in the United States and to home healthcare providers, distributors, private label partners and resellers worldwide. Sales revenue is classified into two areas: business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, business-to-business sales as a percentage of total sales revenue were 61.4%, 59.9% and 60.4%, respectively. Generally, our direct-to-consumer sales have higher gross margins than our business-to-business sales.\nWe also offer a lifetime warranty for direct-to-consumer sales. For a fixed price, we agree to provide a fully functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. Lifetime warranties are only offered to patients upon the initial sale of oxygen equipment by us and are non-transferable. Product sales with lifetime warranties are considered to be multiple element arrangements within the scope of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-25-Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements.\nThere are two deliverables when a product that includes a lifetime warranty is sold. The first deliverable is the oxygen concentrator equipment which comes with a standard warranty of three years. The second deliverable is the lifetime warranty that provides for a functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. These two deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting.\nThe revenue is allocated to the two deliverables on a relative selling price method. We have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price for the equipment. To determine the selling price of the lifetime warranty, we use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable as the lifetime warranty is neither separately priced nor is selling price available through third-party evidence. To calculate the selling price associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall business, the average estimated cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties. A significant estimate used to calculate the price and expense of lifetime warranties is the life expectancy of patients. Based on clinical studies, we estimate that 60% of patients will succumb to their disease within three years. Given the approximate mortality rate of 20% per year, we estimate on average all patients will succumb to their disease within five years. We have taken into consideration that when patients decide to buy an Inogen\nportable oxygen concentrator with a lifetime warranty, they typically have already been on oxygen for a period of time, which can have a large impact on their life expectancy from the time our product is deployed.\nAfter applying the relative selling price method, revenue from equipment sales is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria for product sales are met. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred for the first three years and is recognized using the straight-line method during the fourth and fifth year after the delivery of the equipment which is the estimated usage period of the contract based on the average patient life expectancy.\nFreight revenue consists of fees associated with the deployment of products internationally or domestically, when expedited freight options or minimum order quantities are not met. Freight revenue is a percentage markup of freight costs.\nRental revenue\nOur rental revenue is primarily derived from the rental of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to patients through reimbursement from Medicare, private payors and Medicaid, which typically also includes a patient responsibility component for patient co-insurance and deductibles. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates due to the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines and increases in capped patients on service.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840 - Leases. We have a separate contract with each patient that is not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. The lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month. Included in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not billed. The estimate of unbilled rental revenue accrual is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nCost of revenue\nCost of sales revenue\nCost of sales revenue consists primarily of costs incurred in the production process, including costs of component materials, assembly labor and overhead, warranty, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, rework and delivery costs for items sold. Labor and overhead expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for manufacturing, logistics, repair, quality assurance, and facility costs. They also include manufacturing freight in, materials, temporary labor, outside services, consulting, and depreciation expense. We provide a three-year or lifetime warranty on Inogen One systems sold and a three-year warranty on Inogen At Home systems sold. We established a reserve for warranty repairs based on historical warranty repair costs incurred. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are provided for at the time of shipment.\nWe expect the average unit costs of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to continue to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to develop lower-cost systems and to improve our manufacturing processes, and increase production volume and yields.\nCost of rental revenue\nCost of rental revenue consists primarily of depreciation expense and service costs for rental patients, including rework costs, material, labor, freight, consumable disposables and logistics costs.\nWe expect the average rental service costs per patient to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce logistics costs, material, labor and depreciation.\nOperating expense\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for research and development and engineering employees, allocated facility costs, laboratory supplies, product development materials, consulting fees and related costs, and testing costs for new product launches. We have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception. Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to enhance our technologies and to support development and commercialization of new and existing products. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the upcoming Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expense primarily supports our direct-to-consumer strategy. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation for sales, marketing, customer service and clinical service employees, and allocated facilities costs. They also include expenses for media and advertising, printing, informational kits, dues and fees, including credit card fees, sales promotional and marketing activities, travel and entertainment expenses as well as customer service and clinical services. Sales and marketing expenses increased throughout 2014 and 2015, primarily due to an increase in the sales force and the increasing number of rental patients, and we expect a further increase in 2016 as we continue to increase sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees in our compliance, finance, medical billing, human resources, information technology, business development and general management functions, consulting fees, facilities costs, bad debt expense, and board of directors expenses, including stock-based compensation. In addition, general and administrative expense includes professional services, such as legal, patent registration and defense costs, insurance, consulting and accounting services, including audit and tax services, and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as the number of administrative personnel grows and we continue to introduce new products, broaden our customer base and grow our business. We also expect legal, accounting and compliance costs to increase due to costs associated with being a public company.\nOther income (expense), net\nOur other income (expense), net consisted primarily of foreign currency translation losses in 2015, interest expense related to our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 and 2013, and interest income driven by the interest accruing on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Other income (expense), net also includes the change in valuation of warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo valuation model in 2014.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on income taxes, if any, within income tax provision (benefit). No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31,\n2015, we had federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize these carryforwards could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on our federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nResult of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales revenue increased $40.5 million to $113.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 55.4% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 23,400 unit increase in the number of oxygen systems sold. We sold 56,600 oxygen systems during the year ended December 31, 2015, or an increase of 70.5% over the comparable year. The increase in the number of systems sold in 2015 included sales of the new Inogen At Home stationary system that was first introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nRental revenue increased $5.9 million to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.1% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net rental patients to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 from 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. The net patient increase was primarily attributable to additional marketing efforts, increased sales personnel and productivity improvements, partially offset by an increase in the minimum requirements for available billable months for new rental customers. In addition, rental revenue adjustments came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by region and category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business-to-business international sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct-to-consumer domestic rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 112,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDomestic sales in both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer increased 78.0% and 49.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in domestic business-to-business sales was primarily the result of increased demand from our private label distributor (which began in the first quarter of 2015) and resellers, as well as increased consumer demand for our products due to our marketing efforts and the marketing efforts of our business partners. The increase in direct-to-consumer sales was primarily due to the hiring of the additional internal sales representatives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015, our expansion of marketing strategies, and our continued focus on direct-to-consumer sales with more selective new rental customer set-ups. In addition, the new Inogen At Home stationary system was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 which added additional sales in 2015 versus 2014.\nBusiness-to-business international sales increased 44.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to continued demand in Europe and partially due to the approval of our Inogen One G3 system for reimbursement in France and Germany in the second half of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we plan to continue to expand our presence in other countries as additional opportunities are cultivated. Of our international sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, 89.5% was in Europe, compared to 87.6% in the comparative period in 2014.\nOur rental revenue increase was primarily attributable to the net 15.5% increase in the number patients on service to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 versus 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, rental revenue adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the number of unbilled patients in the capped period increased to 14.1% as of December 31, 2015 from 13.5% as of December 31, 2014, for which $0 revenue was recognized for these patients.\nIn future periods, revenue may be impacted by seasonality resulting in higher sales in the warmer weather spring and summer months due to patients traveling in those periods and lower revenue in the low travel and colder weather months. We also will be impacted by lower Medicare and third-party reimbursement rates, including competitive bidding, the number of sales representatives, the level of and response from potential customers to direct-to-consumer marketing spend, the number and demand of business-to-business partners and distributors, other uncontrollable factors such as changes in the market and competition. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates in connection with the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 82,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage- rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manufacture our products in our Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas facilities. Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to quality and customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $22.9 million to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 59.1% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material costs for our products associated with design changes, better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales revenue as a percentage of sales revenue in future periods to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $2.9 million to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.6% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental asset depreciation, repair costs, disposables, product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of rental revenue included $12.0 million of rental asset depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin decreased to 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in sales revenue gross margin was primarily related to a shift in sales mix towards lower margin business-to-business customer sales domestically versus direct-to-consumer sales which carry higher gross margins. The increased demand from domestic business-to-business channels was primarily the result of the introduction of private label sales intended to increase volume and market share at lower average selling prices, increased reseller demand, and strategic price concessions in our business-to-business channels worldwide primarily due to increased volume and currency fluctuations. While the change in mix drove higher total sales revenue, there was an overall 8.8% decline in revenue per sales unit, which had a negative impact on gross margin. This was partially offset by a decrease in overall sales cost of goods sold per unit sold of 6.7%, largely driven by lower material and freight costs.\nRental revenue gross margin decreased slightly to 53.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014, largely due to slight declines in net rental revenue per patient.\nThe overall gross margin decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decline was consistent with the overall mix of sales and rental revenue as discussed above.\nResearch and development expense\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense increased $1.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 40.4% over the prior year. As a percent of revenue, research and development expense was essentially flat at 2.6% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses for engineering projects and $0.3 million for product development expense.\nWe expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the new Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing expense\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense increased $7.3 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 30.2% over the comparable year.

Value added tax (VAT) was also paid in Euros upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed so was subject to Euro currency translation losses. Fluctuations in the Euro currency to the U.S. dollar exchange rate as well as the decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement compared to prior year resulted in a decrease in net other expense in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (84\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to tax benefit adjustments of $1.6 million mainly related to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to California net operating losses recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and an increase in equity compensation deductions.

Of our international sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, 87.6% was in Europe.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit - rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage - sales revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage- rental revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manufacture our products in our Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas facilities. Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $14.4 million to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 59.2% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material and labor and overhead costs for our products associated with better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $6.2 million to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 50.9% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental assets, depreciation and product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of\nrental revenue included $10.3 million of rental asset depreciation for year ended December 31, 2014 versus $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin increased to 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 45.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales revenue gross margin was partially due to increased sales mix toward our higher margin Inogen One G3 as compared to our Inogen One G2, and the continued shift towards direct-to-consumer sales revenue in our revenue mix. Rental revenue gross margin decreased to 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 60.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to lower rental reimbursement rates resulting from round two competitive bidding that became effective July 1, 2013 and round one re-compete competitive bidding that became effective January 1, 2014. The overall gross margin decreased to 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decline was consistent with the mix in sales revenue gross margin and the decline in rental revenue gross margin.\nResearch and development expense\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense increased $0.6 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 24.1% over the comparable year.

The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014, which was driven by the decrease in average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 compared to the prior year. Other income, net, in 2013 was primarily associated with investment income received in connection with the sale of our interest in our former product liability insurance company. This other income was not expected to recur in future periods. Other expense, net, in 2014 consisted primarily of loss on foreign currency transactions related to the import of our goods into the European Union. Value added tax (VAT) was paid upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed in Euros. Fluctuations in the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate resulted in a net expense. The increase in preferred stock warrant liability was due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrants outstanding through a Monte Carlo valuation model due to higher enterprise value and the increased likelihood of an initial public offering during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,587\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -114.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -28.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -561.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the change in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2013.

For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months.

In addition, we held $16.8 million in certificates of deposits which had maturities greater than ninety days, but less than twelve months, and which were classified as short-term investments. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, from borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million debt outstanding in patent licensing debt. Since inception, we have received net proceeds of $91.7 million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock and $52.5 million ($49.7 million net proceeds) in connection with the sale of common stock in our initial public offering.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15.0 million working capital revolving line of credit and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three-year working capital revolving line of credit which replaced the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica Bank. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25%.\nPursuant to the revolving credit agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants relating to our net worth and EBITDA. Tangible net worth under the revolving credit agreement is calculated by subtracting the sum of intangible assets and total liabilities from total assets. EBITDA is defined in the revolving credit agreement as our net income plus interest expense, plus depreciation expense, plus amortization expense, plus income tax expense, plus non-cash expense, plus extraordinary losses, minus non-cash income, and minus extraordinary gains, as computed during certain test periods provided in the revolving credit agreement. We are required to maintain at all times a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and EBITDA (i) of $10.0 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014 through the four-quarter test period ending March 31, 2016 and (ii) of $12.5 million for any four-quarter test period commencing with the four-quarter test period ending June 30, 2016 and continuing thereafter.\nThe agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type, including non-payment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, and bankruptcy. In the event we fail to satisfy our covenants, or otherwise go into default, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has a number of remedies, including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Certain of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2015, in order to be in compliance with the EBITDA and tangible net worth requirements, we were required to maintain $10.0 million in EBITDA for the preceding test period, and we had $32.4 million in EBITDA for that period. In addition, we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and we had a tangible net worth of $133.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $15.0 million in available debt capacity under the revolving facility.\nOur principal uses of cash in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the funding of our capital expenditures including additional rental assets of $10.2 million and the net purchase of available-for-sale investments of $16.8 million. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, available borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan agreement and the cash to be generated from expected product sales and rentals, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and investing requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our\navailable financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nIf we require additional funds in the future, we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms, or at all. In the future, we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, which would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nThe following tables show a summary of our cash flows and working capital for the periods indicated:\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Summary of cash flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,305\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,591\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts receivable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventories, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred tax asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepaid expenses and other current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued payroll\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Warranty reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nWe derive operating cash flows from cash collected from the sales and rental of our products and services. These cash flows received are partially offset by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. Net income in each period has increased associated with increased sales, improving product mix and lower costs of revenues. In addition, operating expense leverage has increased as expenses have not grown as quickly as revenues due to improved operating efficiencies. The changes in cash related to operating assets and liabilities discussed below were primarily due to the following factors that occurred across all periods: an increase in cash used related to inventory to support our growth in revenue; an increase in cash used by accounts receivable resulting from growth in rental receivables which typically have a longer collection cycle; and an increase in cash related to accounts payable resulting from the higher level of operating expenses needed to support the higher sales level.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of our net income of $11.6 million adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization of our equipment and leasehold improvements of $14.0 million, provision for rental revenue adjustments of $8.5 million, deferred tax assets of $4.8 million, provision for sales returns of $4.9 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and loss on disposal of rental units of $1.2 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $14.9 million, of which $19.0 million was due to a net increase in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets during this period, a net increase of $1.7 million in income tax receivable, partially offset by a net increase of $2.0 million of deferred revenue, $1.6 million of accounts payable, $1.2 million of accrued payroll and $0.1 million of the warranty reserve.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for each of the periods presented was primarily related to the production and purchase of rental assets, manufacturing tooling, and computer equipment and software to support our expanding business. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, net cash used in investing activities also included the net purchase of available-for-sale investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $36.6 million primarily in certificates of deposits with maturities greater than ninety days and less than twelve months that were classified as short-term investments, partially offset by $19.8 million in maturities of available-for-sale investments. In addition, we invested $10.2 million in rental assets and $2.2 million in other property, equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nWe expect to continue investing in property and equipment as we expand our operations. Our business is inherently capital intensive. For example, we expend significant manufacturing and production expense in connection with the development and production of our oxygen concentrator products and, in connection with our rental business, we incur expense in the deployment of rental products to our patients. Investments will continue to be required in order to grow our revenue.\nFinancing activities\nHistorically, we have funded our operations through our sales and rental revenue, the issuance of preferred and common stock, and the incurrence of indebtedness.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $2.3 million from the proceeds of stock options that were exercised and purchases under our employee stock purchase program. This was partially offset by $1.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements on the exercise of employee stock options and $0.3 million of payments on our contractual obligation.\nAccounts receivable\nGross accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts, rental adjustments and sales returns increased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $23.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nIncluded in accounts receivable were earned but held and unbilled receivables of $5.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays, ranging from a day to several weeks between the date of service, and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor-specific documentation from internal and external sources. Earned but held and unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from some payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. These adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review.\nManagement performs analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable. Specifically, management considers historical realization data, accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party reimbursement, it is possible that management's estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows.\nWe derive a significant portion of our rental revenue from Medicare. Revenue is recognized at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by payors and patients. Our billing system contains payor-specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect\nor contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer. For Medicare and Medicaid revenue, as well as most other third-party payors, final payment is subject to administrative review and audit. We make estimated provisions for adjustments, including adjustments from administrative review and audit, based on historical experience. We closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms in an attempt to use the most accurate information available in determining these provisions. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimates, actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record.\nCollection of rental receivables from third-party payors and patients is a significant source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid, but patient responsibility amounts (generally deductibles and co-insurance) remain outstanding. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs and aging of accounts receivable. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when all collection efforts (including payor appeals processes) have been exhausted. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical contractual adjustments and bad debt rates and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as provision for doubtful accounts.\nGross accounts receivable balance concentrations by major category as of

receivable to 23.6% as of December 31, 2015 from 16.2% as of December 31, 2014 was primarily related to the increase in patient responsibility and growth of our held and unbilled accounts receivable balances and the increased age of Medicare related receivables. We have increased billing staff to decrease past-due balances and held and unbilled to 66 as of December 31, 2015 from 52 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have implemented new collection procedures with third-party collection agencies to achieve higher collectability rates, as well as timelier payment processing from Medicare, Medicaid and third-party, payors whereby they assist with the follow-up and completion of additional requests from these payors to expedite payment. We believe our reserves are adequate and properly present the collectability of our outstanding accounts receivable balances based on our analysis of these balances. We review the accounts receivables on a monthly basis to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts, and adjust the reserves accordingly.\nThe ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months due to the time required for claims to be processed by the payors and patients, and for additional documentation to be submitted in the case of denials, which may further prolong the collection process. In addition, certain receivables are transferred to a third-party processor and we cannot anticipate the timing of those collections or whether they will be successful. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses, including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs, aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor-specific concerns. The determination that an account is uncollectible and the ultimate write-off of that account occurs once collection is considered to be highly unlikely, and it is written-off and charged to the allowance at that time.\nWe do not use an aging threshold for account receivable write-offs. However, the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted, and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write-off.\nSources of funds\nOur cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38.2 million compared to $15.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $66.1 million and available borrowing capacity under our working capital revolving line of credit of $15.0 million.\nWe believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, operating expenses and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may make material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income excluding interest income, interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and stock-based compensation. Below, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other\norganizations may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income in the same manner as we calculate these measures.\nWe include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are important measures upon which our management assesses our operating performance. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets, changes related to the fair value re-measurements of our preferred stock warrants, and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income for business planning purposes, to incentivize and compensate our management personnel, and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities.\nOur uses of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments; \n \u00b7 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; \n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and \n \u00b7 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. \nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by certain expenses. When evaluating our performance, you should consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income alongside other financial performance measures, including other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>

and term loan agreement\nIn October 2012, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement with Comerica Bank as the administrative agent, which we refer to as our Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement. This agreement incorporated amounts outstanding under one prior loan agreement whereby the existing balances and the payback terms were not changed. This transaction did not result in any debt extinguishment losses or gains. We did not incur or defer any financing cost directly related to the amended loan and security agreement.\nThe Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement also provided for a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $3.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan A, a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $8.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan B, a new term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $12.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan C, and an accounts receivable revolving line of credit amounting to up to $1.0 million based on 80% of eligible accounts receivable, which we refer to as the revolver.\nWe had borrowings of $0, $0 and $0.4 million outstanding under Term Loan A as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $3.8 million outstanding under Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $5.7 million outstanding under Term Loan C as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPayments of interest for the Term Loan were generally payable monthly. Payment of principal is payable monthly. Each term loan bears interest at the base rate, which is a rate equal to the applicable margin plus the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate, as defined in the agreement, plus 1%, and (iii) the daily adjusting LIBOR rate, plus 1%. The applicable margins for Term Loans A, B and C are 1.25%, 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively. Upon the closing of an acquisition or initial public offering during the term of the revolving credit and term loan agreement, the lenders were entitled to a fee equal to $120,000. This fee was initiated upon the close of the IPO that occurred in February, 2014, and was subsequently paid in March, 2014 and is recorded as other finance and bank fees in 2014. The Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement expired in October 2013.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15 million working capital revolving line of credit, and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three year working capital revolving line of credit which replaces the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is LIBOR plus 1.25%. We are required to maintain a tangible net worth not less than $90 million and EBITDA of $10 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014. We were in compliance as of December 31, 2015, and no outstanding debt balances were outstanding on the credit facility.\nThe revolving credit and term loan agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur\nencumbrances, make distributions to holders of our capital stock, make investments, engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, we must comply with certain financial covenants relating to liquidity, debt service, and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our obligations under the revolving credit and term loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property.\nWe may from time to time, depending upon market conditions and financing needs, seek to refinance or repurchase our debt securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nUse of funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding our new rental asset deployments and other capital purchases, operations, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments, and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, our revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, our cash flows from customer collections have increased as have our profits. As a result, our cash provided by operating activities has increased over time and now is a source of capital to the business. We expect operating activities to continue to be a source of capital to the business in the future.\nDue to the portion of our business that drives rental revenue, which needs continuing asset deployments to net new patients, our cash used in investing activities has increased over time. We expect our investment cash requirements to increase in the future as we increase our rental patient base and deploy rental assets among Medicare and private payors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to support our investing operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases - properties(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases - equipment and other(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We lease manufacturing and office space in Richardson, TX, Goleta, CA, Smyrna, TN, Huntsville, AL, Aurora, CO and Middleburg Heights, OH with terms that expire between 2017 and 2022. \n (2) This consists of miscellaneous office and processing equipment in both Texas and California with terms expiring within 10 months to 5 years. \n (3) In 2011, we entered into an amendment to a licensing agreement whereby we were assigned the entire right, title and interest in a portfolio of patents in exchange for an imputed promissory note calculated via prime plus 2 points for $0.7 million, in addition to a $0.8 million existing obligation to the original licensor, for a total of $1.5 million due to the original licensor in installments starting May 22, 2011, and ending October 31, 2016. \n (4) We obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective suppliers. As of December 31, 2015, we had purchase obligations of $23.0 million of which timing of those obligations vary depending on demand, current supply on hand and other factors. The obligations normally do not extend beyond twelve month time-frames. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 million which were netted in noncurrent deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million. The\ntable does not include any payments related to liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any other payments. See Note 6 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical accounting policies and significant estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to:\n \u25cf revenue recognition \n \u25cf stock-based compensation \n \u25cf inventory and rental asset valuation \n \u25cf accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns and adjustments \n \u25cf income taxes \nRevenue recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales and rentals of our products. Our products consist of our proprietary line of oxygen concentrators and related accessories. A small portion of our revenue comes from extended service contracts and freight revenue for product shipments.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonable assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product. Provisions for estimated returns and discounts are made at the time of shipment. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are also provided for at the time of shipment.\nAccruals for estimated warranty expenses are made at the time that the associated revenue is recognized. We use judgment to estimate these accruals and, if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our products under warranty were greater than our estimates, our cost of revenue could be adversely affected in future periods. The provisions for estimated returns, discounts and warranty obligations are made based on known claims and discount commitments and estimates of additional returns and warranty obligations based on historical data and future expectations. We had accrued $2.0 million and $1.1 million to provide for future warranty costs at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRevenue from the sale of used rental equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured and other revenue recognition criteria are met. When a rental unit is sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gains or losses are included in gross profit.\nRevenue from the sales of our services is recognized when no significant obligations remain undelivered and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured, which is generally when risks and rewards of the product have transferred to the buyer, generally upon receipt of the product. We offer extended service contracts on our Inogen One systems for periods ranging from 12 to 24 months after the end of the standard warranty period. Revenue from extended service contracts and lifetime warranty is deferred and recognized in income over the contract period. To calculate the value associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall company, the average cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties and created a best estimate. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred and recognized after the standard three year warranty period, on a straight-line basis, in year four and five. Under the lifetime warranty, the company will provide replacement equipment without any additional cost to the consumer for the duration of the patient's life. Lifetime warranties are non-transferable.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840-Leases. We have separate contracts with each patient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. We evaluate the individual lease contracts at lease inception and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if there is reasonable assurance that the bargain renewal option associated with the potential capped free rental period would be exercised. Historically, the exercise of such bargain renewal option is not reasonably assured at lease inception and most subsequent monthly lease renewal periods. If we determine that the reasonable assurance threshold for an individual patient is met at lease inception or at a monthly lease renewal period, such determination would impact the bargain renewal period for an individual lease. We would first consider the lease classification (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease term, which may include a portion of the capped rental period. To date, we have not deferred any amounts associated with the capped rental period. Amounts related to the capped rental period have not been material in the periods presented.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received, although product was delivered and revenue was earned. Upon determination that an account is uncollectible, it is written-off and charged to the allowance. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month.\nRental revenue is recognized as earned, less estimated adjustments. Revenue not billed at the end of the period is reviewed for the likelihood of collections and accrued. The rental revenue stream is not guaranteed and payment will cease if the patient no longer needs oxygen or returns the equipment. Revenue recognized is at full estimated allowable reimbursement rates. Rental revenue is earned for that month if the patient is on service on the first day of the 30-day period commencing on the recurring date of service for a particular claim, regardless if there is a change in condition/death after that date. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services. We have determined that the balances are collectable at the time of revenue recognition because the patient signs a notice of financial responsibility outlining their obligations.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts that were earned but not able to be billed for various reasons. The criteria for recognizing revenue had been met as of period-end, but there were specific reasons why we were unable to bill Medicare and private insurance for these amounts. As a result, we create an unbilled rental revenue accrual based on these earned revenues not billed based on a percentage of unbilled amounts and historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date represents management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value, prior to the IPO, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u25cf Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to the IPO our common stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of the common stock as discussed in Pre-IPO Common Stock Valuations\u201d below. Following our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock. \n \u25cf Expected Term. The expected term for stock options granted to employees (including members of our board of directors) was estimated using the simplified method allowed under SEC guidance. For grants to non-employees, the expected term is equal to the contractual term, which have ranged from seven to ten years. \n \u25cf Expected Volatility. Given the limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers, which we have designated, based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have designated, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \u25cf Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \u25cf Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nPre-IPO common stock valuations\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was approved by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share equal to the per-share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, the board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:\n \u25cf contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; \n \u25cf the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of preferred stock relative to the common stock; \n \u25cf the prices of preferred stock sold to third-party investors in arms-length transactions; \n \u25cf the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions; \n \u25cf our operating and financial performance; \n \u25cf current business conditions and projections; \n \u25cf our stage of development; \n \u25cf the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions; \n \u25cf any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for common stock; \n \u25cf the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and \n \u25cf the U.S. and global capital market conditions. \nIn order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants issued, we determined the enterprise value, added net cash, then allocated the equity value to each class of equity securities outstanding (preferred stock, common stock and options).\nInventory and rental asset valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, certain component parts to be used in manufacturing our products and finished goods. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, including material, labor, and manufacturing overhead, whereby the standard costs are updated at least quarterly to approximate actual costs using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value. We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete, slow-moving or impaired items. The business environment in which we operate is subject to changes in technology and customer demand. We review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components at least quarterly, taking into account product life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.\nRental assets are valued at standard cost to manufacture or purchase the product, including appropriate labor and overhead. Costs are reviewed at least quarterly to confirm standard costs approximate actual costs using the FIFO method. Rental assets are depreciated over the life of the asset, typically 18 months to 60 months. Rental asset disposals or losses are recorded at net book value in cost of rental revenue.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns, and adjustments\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that, in our opinion, is adequate to absorb potential losses related to account receivables and is based upon our continuous evaluation of the collectability of outstanding balances. Our evaluation takes into consideration such factors as past bad debt experience, economic conditions, and information about specific receivables. Our evaluation also considers the age and composition of the outstanding amount in determining their net realizable values. The allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods that they become known. The allowance is increased by bad debt provisions charged to operating expense and reduced by direct write-offs, net of recoveries. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services.\nIn general, our allowance for doubtful accounts is higher for our rental revenue compared to our sales revenue. The nature of our rental business necessitates a larger bad debt reserve against billings, as a higher percentage of our billed revenue may never be collected as a result of the failure of some patients to pay their co-insurance and deductible obligations and some billing disputes with payors.\nProvision for sales returns applies to direct-to-consumer sales only. We do not allow returns from providers. This reserve is calculated based on actual historical return rates under our 30-day return program and is applied to the current period's sales revenue for direct-to-consumer sales. We have experienced a small increase in the historical returns rate during the period, primarily due to increased competition among other providers and resellers and a slight increase in product failures in the relevant periods.\nWe also record an allowance for rental revenue adjustments and write-offs, which is recorded as a reduction of rental revenue and rental accounts receivable balances. These adjustments and write offs result from contractual adjustments, audit adjustments, or billing not paid due to another provider performing same or similar functions for the patient in the same period, all of which prevent billed revenue to become realizable. The reserve is based on historical revenue adjustments as a percentage of rental revenue billed during the related period.\nIncluded in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of $5.2 million in December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays in billing can occur between the date revenue is earned and when billing occurs due to delays in receiving the appropriate paperwork for each payor. Earned but unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability. A portion of revenue and related costs are deferred each month for monthly rental revenue based on the timing of the recurring billing and then recorded as revenue in the subsequent month.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on taxes, if any, within operations as income tax expense. No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize net operating losses could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on the federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nIn August 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Company's pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard.\nInventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\u201d thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nInterest\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this update as of the year ended December 31, 2015 with no effect to our financial statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software - Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The update provides guidance on fees paid by an entity in a cloud computing arrangement and whether an arrangement includes a license to the underlying software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the entity should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the entity should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a statement of financial position. We early-adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net noncurrent deferred tax asset in our Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The new guidance will require organizations that lease assets-referred to as lessees\u201d-to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. This will increase the reported assets and liabilities - in some cases very significantly. ASU No. 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new lease recognition guidance, and have not yet determined the impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEmerging Growth Company\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management over our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company\u201d if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively, which could result in a loss of\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for any other contractually narrow or limited purpose. However, from time to time we enter into certain types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third-party claims including certain real estate leases, supply purchase agreements, and directors and officers. The terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein. Generally, amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted thus no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheets for any of the periods presented.\nInflation\nWe experience pricing pressures in the form of continued reductions in reimbursement rates, particularly from governmental payors such as Medicare or Medicaid but also private payors. We can also be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor and employee benefits. However, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases, especially in contracts where pricing is fixed over a specific period. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Traditionally, these patients have relied on stationary oxygen concentrator systems for use in the home and oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use. The tanks and cylinders must be delivered regularly and have a finite amount of oxygen, which limits patient mobility and requires patients to plan activities outside of their homes around delivery schedules. Additionally, patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to their stationary concentrators simply to enable mobility within their homes. We refer to this traditional delivery approach as the delivery model. Our proprietary Inogen One systems are devices that concentrate the air around them to offer a single source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere. Using our portable systems, patients can eliminate their dependence on stationary concentrators and tank and cylinder deliveries, thereby improving quality-of-life and fostering mobility.\nIn May 2004, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for our Inogen One G1. From our launch of the Inogen One G1 in 2004, through 2008, we derived our revenue almost exclusively from sales to healthcare providers and distributors. In December 2008, we acquired Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC in order to secure access to the Medicare rental market and began accepting Medicare reimbursement for our oxygen solutions in certain states. At the time of the acquisition, Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC had an active Medicare billing number but few other assets and limited business activities. In January 2009, following the acquisition of Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC, we initiated our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy and began selling Inogen One systems directly to patients and building our Medicare rental business in the United States. In April 2009, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our Goleta, California facility for Home/Durable Medical Equipment Services for oxygen equipment and supplies. In addition, in May 2015, we again received notice of accreditation approval from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for all six locations in which we conduct business, effective from May 8, 2015 through May 7, 2018. We believe we are the only portable oxygen concentrator manufacturer that employs a direct-to-consumer marketing strategy in the United States, meaning we advertise directly to patients, process their physician paperwork, provide clinical support as needed and bill the patient or their insurance on their behalf.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale and rental of our Inogen One systems and related accessories to patients, insurance carriers, home healthcare providers and distributors. We sell multiple configurations of our Inogen One systems with various batteries, accessories, warranties, power cords and language settings. We also rent our products to Medicare beneficiaries and patients with other insurance coverage to support their oxygen needs as prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. Our goal is to design, build and market oxygen solutions that redefine how oxygen therapy is delivered. To accomplish this goal and to grow our revenue, we intend to continue to:\n \u25cf Expand our sales and marketing channels. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we increased our internal sales representatives from 129 to 166. Typically, we expect new sales representatives to take 4-6 months to reach full productivity. Additionally, we are building a physician referral channel that currently consists of 14 sales representatives as of December 31, 2015 up from 12 as of December 31, 2014. Lastly, we are focused on building our international and domestic business-to-business partnerships, including relationships with distributors, key accounts, resellers, and private label partners. \n \u25cf Invest in our product offerings to develop innovative products. We expended $4.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in research and development expenses, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the foreseeable future. We launched our upgraded Inogen One G3 product in December 2015, which has 25% increased oxygen output (1,050 ml/minute versus 840 ml/minute previously), is less expensive to manufacture than our current Inogen One G3 product, and features improvements in sound level (from 42 dBA to 39 dBA). We also expect to launch our fourth-generation portable oxygen concentrator, the Inogen One G4, in the second quarter of 2016 and we expect this product to be smaller, lighter, and less expensive to manufacture than our Inogen One G3 product. \n \u25cf Secure contracts with healthcare payors and insurers. Based on our patient population, we estimate that at least 30% of oxygen therapy patients are covered by non-Medicare payors, and that these patients often represent a younger, more active patient segment. By becoming an in-network provider with more insurance companies, we can reduce the patients' \n co-insurance and deductible obligations on their oxygen services, which we believe will allow us to attract additional patients to our Inogen One and Inogen At Home solutions. \nWe have been developing and refining the manufacturing of our Inogen One systems over the past eleven years. While nearly all of our manufacturing and assembly processes were originally outsourced, assembly of the manifold, compressor, sieve bed and concentrator is now conducted in-house in order to improve quality control and reduce cost. Additionally, we use lean manufacturing practices to maximize manufacturing efficiency. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply several components of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity and quality requirements and delivery terms. In certain cases, these agreements can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. We have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, motors, valves, and some molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels and to manage component quality.\nHistorically, we have generated a majority of our revenue from sales and rentals to customers in the United States. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 22% of our total revenue was from customers outside the United States, primarily in Europe. To date, most of our revenue has been denominated in United States dollars. Approximately 54% of the non-U.S. revenue for 2015 was invoiced in Euros. The Company did not begin to invoice in Euros until the first quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside the United States through distributors or directly to large house\u201d accounts, which include gas companies and home oxygen providers. In those instances, we sell to and bill the distributor or house\u201d accounts directly, leaving responsibility for the patient billing, support and clinical setup to the local provider.\nOur total revenue increased $46.5 million to $159.0 million in 2015 from $112.5 million in 2014, primarily due to growth in sales revenue associated with the increases in business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems, and growth in rental revenue associated with an increase in the number of patients using Medicare or private payors to rent our products. We generated net income of $11.6 million in 2015 and net income of $6.8 million in 2014. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $32.3 million and $24.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). Adjusted net income was $10.0 million for 2015, compared to Adjusted net income of $6.6 million in 2014 (see Non-GAAP financial measures\u201d for reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results). As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $45.1 million.\nSales revenue\nOur future financial performance will be driven in part by the growth in sales of our Inogen One systems, and, to a lesser extent, sales of batteries, other accessories, and sales of our Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrators. We plan to grow our system sales in the coming years through multiple strategies, including: expanding our direct-to-consumer sales efforts through hiring additional sales representatives, investing in consumer awareness, expanding our sales infrastructure and efforts outside of the United States, expanding our business-to-business sales through key partnerships, and enhancing our product offerings through additional product launches. As our product offerings grow, we solicit feedback from our customers and focus our research and development efforts on continuing to improve patient preference and reduce the total cost of the product, in order to further drive sales of our products.\nOur direct-to-consumer sales process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff, and includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, including procuring an oxygen prescription. The patient may consider whether to finance the product through an Inogen-approved third-party or purchase the equipment. Product is not deployed until both the prescription and payment are received. Once product is deployed, the patient has 30 days to return the product, subject to the payment of a minimal processing and handling fee. Approximately 10% of consumers who purchase a system return the system during this 30-day return period.\nOur business-to-business efforts are focused on selling to home medical equipment distributors, oxygen providers, resellers, and private label partners who are based inside and outside of the United States. This process involves interactions with various key customer stakeholders, including sales, purchasing, product testing, and clinical personnel. Businesses that have patient demand that can be met with our oxygen concentrator systems place purchase orders to secure product deployment. This may be influenced based on outside factors, including the result of tender offerings, changes in insurance plan coverage, and overall changes in the net oxygen therapy patient population. Products are shipped freight on board (FOB) Inogen dock domestically, and based on financial history and profile, businesses may either prepay or receive extended terms. Products are shipped both FOB Inogen dock and DDP (Delivery Duty Paid) for certain international shipments depending on the shipper used. DDP shipments are Inogen's property until title has changed, which is upon duty being paid. As a result of these factors, product purchases can be subject to changes in demand by customers.\nWe sold 56,600 systems in 2015, 33,200 systems in 2014 and 19,200 in 2013. Management focuses on system sales as an indicator of current business success.\nRental revenue\nOur direct-to-consumer rental process involves numerous interactions with the individual patient, the physician and the physician's staff. The process includes an in-depth analysis and review of our product, the patient's diagnosis and prescribed oxygen therapy, and their medical history to confirm the appropriateness of our product for the patient's oxygen therapy and compliance with Medicare and private payor billing requirements, which often necessitates additional physician evaluation and/or testing as well as a Certificate of Medical Necessity. Once the product is deployed, the patient receives direction on product use and receives a clinical titration from our licensed staff to confirm the product meets the patient's medical oxygen needs prior to billing. As a result, the time from initial contact with a customer to billing can vary significantly and be up to one month or longer.\nWe plan to grow our rental revenue in the coming years through multiple strategies, including expanding our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts through hiring additional sales representatives and investing in patient and physician awareness, securing additional insurance contracts and continuing to enhance our product offerings through additional product launches. In addition, patients may come off of our services due to death, a change in their condition, a change in location, a change in provider or other factors. In each case, we maintain asset ownership and can redeploy assets as appropriate following such events. Given the length and uncertainty of our patient acquisition cycle and potential returns we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, there may be fluctuations in our net new patient setups on a period-to-period basis.\nAs the rental patient base increases, this rental model generates recurring revenue with minimal additional sales and general and administrative expenses. A portion of rentals include a capped rental period when no additional reimbursement will be allowed unless additional criteria are met. In this scenario, the ratio of billable patients to patients on service is critical to maintaining rental revenue growth as patients on service increases. Medicare has noted a certain percentage of beneficiaries, approximately 25%, based on their review of Medicare claims, reach the 36th month and enter the capped rental period. Our capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service was approximately 14.1% as of December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than the capped patients as a percentage of total patients on service of approximately 13.5% as of December 31, 2014. The percentage of capped patients may fluctuate over time as new patients come on service, patients come off of service before and during the capped rental period, and existing patients enter the capped rental period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 32,800 oxygen rental patients, an increase from 28,400 oxygen rental patients as of December 31, 2014. Management focuses on rental revenue as an indicator of current business success and a leading indicator of likely future rental revenue; however, actual rental revenue recognized is subject to a variety of other factors, including reimbursement levels by payor, patient zip code, the number of capped patients, write-offs for uncollectable balances, and adjustments for patients in transition.\nReimbursement\nWe rely heavily on reimbursement from Medicare, and secondarily from private payors, Medicaid and patients, for our rental revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 73.7% of our rental revenue was derived from Medicare's service reimbursement programs. The U.S. list price for our stationary oxygen rentals (HCPCS E1390) is $260 per month and for our oxygen generating portable equipment (OGPE) rentals (HCPCS E1392) is $70 per month. The current standard Medicare allowable effective January 1, 2016 now varies by state instead of the one national standard allowable for previous years. The national standard allowable in 2015 for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) was $180.92 per month and for OGPE rentals (E1392) was $51.63 per month. Effective January 1, 2016 the standard Medicare allowables for stationary oxygen rentals (E1390) ranges from $135.14 to $145.61 per month and the OGPE rentals (E1392) ranges from $46.69 to $49.52 per month. These are the two primary codes that we bill to Medicare and other payors for our oxygen product rentals. These rates are subject to additional cuts effective July 1, 2016, per competitive bidding guidelines. Those rates have not been announced yet and are subject to the pricing established under the re-bid of round two competitive bidding areas, including any potential adjustments associated with competitive bidding round two re-compete.\nAs of January 1, 2011, Medicare has phased in a program called competitive bidding. Competitive bidding impacts the amount Medicare reimburses suppliers of durable medical equipment rentals, including portable oxygen concentrators. The program is defined geographically, with suppliers submitting bids to provide medical equipment for a specific product category within that geography. Once bids have been placed, an individual company's bids across products within the category are aggregated and weighted by each product's market share in the category. The weighted-average price is then indexed against competitors. Medicare determines a clearing price\u201d out of these weighted-average prices at which sufficient suppliers have indicated they will support patients in the category, and this threshold is typically designed to generate theoretical supply that is twice the expected demand. Bids for each modality among the suppliers that made the cut are then arrayed to determine what Medicare will reimburse for each product category and geographic area. The program has strict anti-collusion guidelines to ensure bidding is truly competitive. Competitive bidding\ncontracts last up to three years once implemented, after which they are subject to a new round of bidding. Discounts off the standard Medicare allowable occur in competitive bidding Metropolitan Statistical Areas where contracts have been awarded as well as in cases where private payors pay less than this allowable. Competitive bidding rates are based on the zip code where the patient resides. Rental revenue includes payments for product, disposables, and customer service/support. As of January 1, 2016, competitive bidding was nationalized. All areas previously not subject to bidding had rate reductions applied instead of doing another bidding process. The fee schedules in the un-bid areas are adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts for areas already under competitive bidding. The regional prices are limited by a national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) and a floor (90% of the average regional prices). Since January 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates for these un-bid areas (with dates of services from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016) are based on 50% of the un-adjusted (current) fee schedule amount and 50% of the adjusted (reduced) fee schedule amount which is based on the regional competitive bidding rates. Starting on July 1, 2016, reimbursement rates will be 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount which will be based on regional competitive bidding rates.\nThe regions are defined as follows:\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines frontier states as states where more than 50% of the counties in the state have a population density of 6 people or less per square mile and rural states are defined as states where more than 50% of the population lives in rural areas per census data. Current frontier states include MT, ND, SD and WY; rural states include ME, MS, VT and WV; and non-contiguous United States areas include AK, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. For frontier and rural states, and frontier and rural zip codes in non-frontier/rural states, the single payment amount will be the national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) to account for higher servicing costs in these areas. For non-contiguous United States areas, single payment amounts will be the higher of the national ceiling, or the average of competitive bidding pricing from these areas, if the areas had been bid through competitive bidding. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population.\nCMS has also re-bid for competitive bidding round two re-compete, associated with approximately 50% of the Medicare market with contracts set to begin July 1, 2016 and continue through December 31, 2018. CMS updated the product categories and the competitive bidding areas. Respiratory equipment includes oxygen, oxygen equipment, continuous positive airway pressure devices, respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories. Nebulizers are now their own separate product category instead of being included in the respiratory equipment category. Round two re-compete is in the same geographic areas that were included in the original round two. However, as a result of the Office of Management and Budget's updates to the original 91 round two metropolitan statistical areas, there are now 90 metropolitan statistical areas for round two re-compete and 117 competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Any CBA that was previously located in multi-state metropolitan statistical areas was redefined so that no CBA is included in more than one state. The round two re-compete competitive bidding areas have nearly the same zip codes as the round two competitive bidding areas; the associated changes in the zip codes since competitive bidding was implemented are reflective in this round two re-compete. Pricing is expected to be announced in winter 2016 according to CMS, and will impact both the zip codes covered under round two and also the rates for the un-bid areas effective July 1, 2016.\nCMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Bids were due by December 16, 2015. In round one 2017, there are 9 metropolitan statistical areas and 13 CBAs to make sure each CBA does not cross state boundaries. We estimate approximately 9% of the Medicare market will be impacted by these contracts set to begin January 1, 2017 and continue through December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the current Medicare standard allowable reimbursement rates and the weighted-average reimbursement rates applicable in Metropolitan Statistical Areas covered by rounds one and two of competitive bidding. The round one re-compete was completed in the same Metropolitan Statistical Areas as round one for the next three-year period starting January 1, 2014 when the original contracts expired.\n\nIn addition to reducing the Medicare reimbursement rates in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the competitive bidding program has effectively reduced the number of oxygen suppliers that can participate in the Medicare program. We believe that more than 75% of existing oxygen suppliers were eliminated in round one of competitive bidding, which was implemented January 1, 2011 in 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Round two of competitive bidding was implemented July 1, 2013 in 91 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and we believe the impact on the number of oxygen suppliers was similar to round one. We believe that 59% of the market was covered by round one and round two of competitive bidding.\nCumulatively in rounds one, two and round one re-compete, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the competitive bidding areas and products for which we submitted bids. However, there is no guarantee that we will garner additional market share as a result of these contracts. The contracts include products that may require us to subcontract certain services or products to third parties, which must be approved by CMS.\nFollowing round one of competitive bidding, we were excluded from the Kansas City-MO-KS, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, and Orlando-Kissimmee-FL competitive bidding areas and Honolulu-Hawaii, where we have never maintained a license. After round one re-compete of competitive bidding, we gained access to Kansas City-MO-KS and were excluded from the following competitive bidding areas: Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor-OH, Cincinnati-Middletown-OH, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, Orlando-Kissimmee-FL, Pittsburg-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. After round two of competitive bidding, we were excluded from an additional 10 competitive bidding areas, including Akron-OH, Cape Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota-FL, Ocala, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL and Toledo-OH. Collectively, we have incrementally lost access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market as of July 1, 2013. As a result, on a going forward basis we will continue to have access to approximately 90% of the Medicare market based on our analysis of the 92 competitive bidding areas that we have won out of the 109 competitive bidding areas, representing 59% of the market, with the remaining 41% of the market not subject to competitive bidding rounds and instead in these areas the rates are applied as discussed above. The incremental loss of access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our rental business. Medicare revenue, including patient co-insurance and deductible obligations, represented 21.0% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect the decline in total revenue resulting from the loss of competitive bidding contracts in the areas that we were excluded from to be partially offset by the grandfathering\u201d of existing Medicare patients, direct sales to former Medicare patients with third-party insurance coverage, or Medicare patients paying out-of-pocket to purchase our products. Our revenue from Medicare in the 17 competitive bidding areas where we were not offered contracts was approximately $0.5 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014.\nUnder the Medicare competitive bidding program, providers may grandfather\u201d existing patients on service up to the implementation date of the competitive bidding program. This means providers may retain all existing patients and continue to receive reimbursement for them so long as the new reimbursement rate is accepted and the applicable beneficiary chooses to continue to receive equipment from the provider. Providers must either keep or release all patients under this grandfathering\u201d arrangement in each competitive bidding area; specific individual selection of patients for retention or release is not allowed. Providers can continue to sell equipment in competitive bid areas where they were not awarded contracts to patients paying out-of-pocket or with third-party insurance coverage.\nWe have elected to grandfather\u201d and retain all patients in competitive bid areas where contracts were not awarded to us. In addition, we continue to accept patients in competitive bidding areas where we did not receive contracts through private insurance. We also pursue retail sales of our equipment to patients in those areas.\nMedicare reimbursement for oxygen rental equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month period and the equipment is always owned by the home oxygen provider. The provider that billed Medicare for the 36th month continues to be responsible for the patient's oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and there is generally no additional reimbursement for oxygen generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse suppliers for oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the patient. The provider is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases CMS will reimburse for repair costs. After the five year useful life is reached, the patient may request replacement equipment and, if he or she can be re-qualified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle out of the next 60 months of service would begin. The provider may not arbitrarily issue new equipment. We have analyzed the potential impact to revenue associated with patients in the capped rental period and have deferred $0 associated with the capped rental period for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur obligations to service assigned Medicare patients over the contract rental period include supplying working equipment that meets the patient's oxygen needs pursuant to their doctor's prescription and certificate of medical necessity form and supplying all disposables required for the patient to operate the equipment, including cannulas, filters, replacement batteries, carts and carry bags, as needed. If the equipment malfunctions, we must repair or replace the equipment. We determine what equipment the patient receives, and we can deploy existing used assets as long as the prescription requirements are met. We must also procure a recertification certificate of medical necessity from the patient's doctor to confirm the patient's need for oxygen therapy one year after first receiving oxygen therapy and one year after each new 36-month reimbursement period begins. These contracts are cancellable by the patient at any time and by the provider at any time as long as the patient can transition to another provider.\nIn addition to the adoption of the competitive bidding program, reimbursable fees for oxygen rental services in non-competitive bidding areas were eligible to receive mandatory annual Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U, updates beginning in 2010. For 2014, the CPI-U was +1.8%, but the multi-factor productivity adjustment, adjustment\u201d, was -0.8%, so the net result was a 1.0% increase in fee schedule payments in 2014 for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. However, the stationary oxygen equipment codes payment amounts, as required by statute, must be adjusted on an annual basis, as necessary, to ensure budget neutrality of the new payment class for oxygen generating portable equipment. Thus, the increase in allowable payment amounts for stationary oxygen equipment codes increased 0.5% from 2013 to 2014. For 2015, the CPI-U was +2.1%, but the adjustment was -0.6%, so the net result was a 1.5% increase in fee schedule payments in 2015 for stationary oxygen equipment for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. This does not apply for 2016 as the standard allowables were set for each state based on regional averages of the competitive bidding prices as described previously.\nIn addition, the President's proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2017 includes multiple provisions that could impact the Company if they were enacted. The budget proposed eliminating the 36-month cap for oxygen equipment, and reducing the monthly payment amount for oxygen and oxygen equipment by the necessary percentage to be budget neutral. The Company's patient population may materially differ from the Medicare population, which could lead to either more or less revenue if this is enacted. In addition, this would likely also impact the number of patients interested in a cash purchase and could increase rental patients and decrease out-of-pocket purchases. The proposed budget also proposes to extend the authority to require prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items and services, particularly those that are at the highest risk for improper payment. The proposed budget also contains multiple provisions related to the Medicare appeals process including establishing a refundable filing fee (non-refundable if denied), providing the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and Department Appeals Board Authority to use Recover Audit Contractor collections, and increase minimum amount in controversy for administrative law judge adjudication of claims to equal the amount required for judicial review. In addition, this proposal includes the ability to remand appeals to the redetermination level with the introduction of new evidence and the ability to sample and consolidate similar claims for administrative efficiency.\nA ruling from CMS has outlined the expansion of competitive bidding to certain previously unbid areas by applying regional pricing averages to unbid areas with 110% of regional prices to be paid for defined rural and frontier areas. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016. Medicare was 21.0% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, and we estimate that 41% of the Medicare markets will be subject to this reimbursement reduction. We also estimate that on average the rates will be reduced by 35-40% in these areas. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients would be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population. CMS has also re-bid the round two re-compete for contracts from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. CMS has begun the re-bid process for the round one re-compete for contracts from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. For additional discussion of the impact of the recent competitive bidding proposals, see Risk Factors\u201d herein.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 79 contracts with Medicaid and private payors. These contracts qualify us as an in-network provider for these payors. As a result, patients can rent or purchase our systems at the same patient obligation as other in-network\noxygen providers. Based on our patient population, we believe at least 30% of all oxygen therapy patients are covered by private payors. Private payors typically provide reimbursement at 60% to 100% of Medicare allowables for in-network plans, and private payor plans can have 36-month capped rental periods similar to Medicare although they typically do not. We anticipate that private payor reimbursement levels will generally be reset in accordance with Medicare payment amounts established through competitive bidding.\nWe cannot predict the full extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by competitive bidding or by initiatives to reduce costs for private payors. We believe that we are well positioned to respond to the changing reimbursement environment because our product offerings are innovative, patient-focused and cost-effective. We have historically been able to reduce our costs through scalable manufacturing, better sourcing, continuous innovation, and reliability improvements, as well as innovations that reduce our product service costs by minimizing exchanges, such as user replaceable batteries and oxygen filtration cartridges. As a result of bringing manufacturing and assembly largely in-house and our commitment to driving efficient manufacturing processes, we have reduced our overall system cost by 45% from 2009 to 2015. We intend to continue to seek ways to reduce our cost of revenue through manufacturing and design improvements.\nBasis of presentation\nThe following describes the line items set forth in our Statements of Operations.\nRevenue\nWe classify our revenue in two main categories: sales revenue and rental revenue. There will be fluctuations in mix between business-to-business sales, direct-to-consumer sales and rentals from period to period. Inogen One system and Inogen At Home system selling prices and gross margins for our systems may fluctuate as we introduce new products, reduce our product costs, have changes in purchase volumes, and as currency variations occur. For example, the gross margin for our Inogen One G3 is higher than our Inogen One G2 due to lower manufacturing costs and similar average selling prices. Thus, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G3 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G2 systems, our overall gross margins should improve and, conversely, to the extent our sales of our Inogen One G2 systems are higher than sales of our Inogen One G3 systems, our overall gross margins should decline. Quarter over quarter results may vary due to seasonality in both the international and domestic markets. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months.\nSales revenue\nOur sales revenue is derived from the sale of our Inogen One systems, Inogen At Home systems, and related accessories to patients in the United States and to home healthcare providers, distributors, private label partners and resellers worldwide. Sales revenue is classified into two areas: business-to-business sales and direct-to-consumer sales. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, business-to-business sales as a percentage of total sales revenue were 61.4%, 59.9% and 60.4%, respectively. Generally, our direct-to-consumer sales have higher gross margins than our business-to-business sales.\nWe also offer a lifetime warranty for direct-to-consumer sales. For a fixed price, we agree to provide a fully functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. Lifetime warranties are only offered to patients upon the initial sale of oxygen equipment by us and are non-transferable. Product sales with lifetime warranties are considered to be multiple element arrangements within the scope of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-25-Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements.\nThere are two deliverables when a product that includes a lifetime warranty is sold. The first deliverable is the oxygen concentrator equipment which comes with a standard warranty of three years. The second deliverable is the lifetime warranty that provides for a functional oxygen concentrator for the remaining life of the patient. These two deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting.\nThe revenue is allocated to the two deliverables on a relative selling price method. We have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price for the equipment. To determine the selling price of the lifetime warranty, we use our best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable as the lifetime warranty is neither separately priced nor is selling price available through third-party evidence. To calculate the selling price associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall business, the average estimated cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties. A significant estimate used to calculate the price and expense of lifetime warranties is the life expectancy of patients. Based on clinical studies, we estimate that 60% of patients will succumb to their disease within three years. Given the approximate mortality rate of 20% per year, we estimate on average all patients will succumb to their disease within five years. We have taken into consideration that when patients decide to buy an Inogen\nportable oxygen concentrator with a lifetime warranty, they typically have already been on oxygen for a period of time, which can have a large impact on their life expectancy from the time our product is deployed.\nAfter applying the relative selling price method, revenue from equipment sales is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria for product sales are met. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred for the first three years and is recognized using the straight-line method during the fourth and fifth year after the delivery of the equipment which is the estimated usage period of the contract based on the average patient life expectancy.\nFreight revenue consists of fees associated with the deployment of products internationally or domestically, when expedited freight options or minimum order quantities are not met. Freight revenue is a percentage markup of freight costs.\nRental revenue\nOur rental revenue is primarily derived from the rental of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to patients through reimbursement from Medicare, private payors and Medicaid, which typically also includes a patient responsibility component for patient co-insurance and deductibles. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates due to the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines and increases in capped patients on service.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840 - Leases. We have a separate contract with each patient that is not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. The lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month. Included in rental revenue are unbilled amounts for which the revenue recognition criteria had been met as of period-end but were not billed. The estimate of unbilled rental revenue accrual is based on historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nCost of revenue\nCost of sales revenue\nCost of sales revenue consists primarily of costs incurred in the production process, including costs of component materials, assembly labor and overhead, warranty, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, rework and delivery costs for items sold. Labor and overhead expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for manufacturing, logistics, repair, quality assurance, and facility costs. They also include manufacturing freight in, materials, temporary labor, outside services, consulting, and depreciation expense. We provide a three-year or lifetime warranty on Inogen One systems sold and a three-year warranty on Inogen At Home systems sold. We established a reserve for warranty repairs based on historical warranty repair costs incurred. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are provided for at the time of shipment.\nWe expect the average unit costs of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems to continue to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to develop lower-cost systems and to improve our manufacturing processes, and increase production volume and yields.\nCost of rental revenue\nCost of rental revenue consists primarily of depreciation expense and service costs for rental patients, including rework costs, material, labor, freight, consumable disposables and logistics costs.\nWe expect the average rental service costs per patient to decline in future periods as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce logistics costs, material, labor and depreciation.\nOperating expense\nResearch and development\nOur research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for research and development and engineering employees, allocated facility costs, laboratory supplies, product development materials, consulting fees and related costs, and testing costs for new product launches. We have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception. Our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to enhance our technologies and to support development and commercialization of new and existing products. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the upcoming Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing\nOur sales and marketing expense primarily supports our direct-to-consumer strategy. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation for sales, marketing, customer service and clinical service employees, and allocated facilities costs. They also include expenses for media and advertising, printing, informational kits, dues and fees, including credit card fees, sales promotional and marketing activities, travel and entertainment expenses as well as customer service and clinical services. Sales and marketing expenses increased throughout 2014 and 2015, primarily due to an increase in the sales force and the increasing number of rental patients, and we expect a further increase in 2016 as we continue to increase sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including wages, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees in our compliance, finance, medical billing, human resources, information technology, business development and general management functions, consulting fees, facilities costs, bad debt expense, and board of directors expenses, including stock-based compensation. In addition, general and administrative expense includes professional services, such as legal, patent registration and defense costs, insurance, consulting and accounting services, including audit and tax services, and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as the number of administrative personnel grows and we continue to introduce new products, broaden our customer base and grow our business. We also expect legal, accounting and compliance costs to increase due to costs associated with being a public company.\nOther income (expense), net\nOur other income (expense), net consisted primarily of foreign currency translation losses in 2015, interest expense related to our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 and 2013, and interest income driven by the interest accruing on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Other income (expense), net also includes the change in valuation of warrant liability based on the Monte Carlo valuation model in 2014.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on income taxes, if any, within income tax provision (benefit). No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31,\n2015, we had federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize these carryforwards could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on our federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nResult of operations\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\n\nSales revenue increased $40.5 million to $113.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 55.4% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 23,400 unit increase in the number of oxygen systems sold. We sold 56,600 oxygen systems during the year ended December 31, 2015, or an increase of 70.5% over the comparable year. The increase in the number of systems sold in 2015 included sales of the new Inogen At Home stationary system that was first introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nRental revenue increased $5.9 million to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.1% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net rental patients to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 from 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. The net patient increase was primarily attributable to additional marketing efforts, increased sales personnel and productivity improvements, partially offset by an increase in the minimum requirements for available billable months for new rental customers. In addition, rental revenue adjustments came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service in the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nDomestic sales in both business-to-business and direct-to-consumer increased 78.0% and 49.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in domestic business-to-business sales was primarily the result of increased demand from our private label distributor (which began in the first quarter of 2015) and resellers, as well as increased consumer demand for our products due to our marketing efforts and the marketing efforts of our business partners. The increase in direct-to-consumer sales was primarily due to the hiring of the additional internal sales representatives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015, our expansion of marketing strategies, and our continued focus on direct-to-consumer sales with more selective new rental customer set-ups. In addition, the new Inogen At Home stationary system was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014 which added additional sales in 2015 versus 2014.\nBusiness-to-business international sales increased 44.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to continued demand in Europe and partially due to the approval of our Inogen One G3 system for reimbursement in France and Germany in the second half of 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we sold our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we plan to continue to expand our presence in other countries as additional opportunities are cultivated. Of our international sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, 89.5% was in Europe, compared to 87.6% in the comparative period in 2014.\nOur rental revenue increase was primarily attributable to the net 15.5% increase in the number patients on service to 32,800 as of December 31, 2015 versus 28,400 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, rental revenue adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 came in slightly lower as a percentage of gross rental revenue, which was partially offset by lower average amounts billed per patient on service compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the number of unbilled patients in the capped period increased to 14.1% as of December 31, 2015 from 13.5% as of December 31, 2014, for which $0 revenue was recognized for these patients.\nIn future periods, revenue may be impacted by seasonality resulting in higher sales in the warmer weather spring and summer months due to patients traveling in those periods and lower revenue in the low travel and colder weather months. We also will be impacted by lower Medicare and third-party reimbursement rates, including competitive bidding, the number of sales representatives, the level of and response from potential customers to direct-to-consumer marketing spend, the number and demand of business-to-business partners and distributors, other uncontrollable factors such as changes in the market and competition. We expect our rental revenue per patient to decline in future periods due to lower reimbursement rates in connection with the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines. While we are monitoring the implementation of this ruling, we believe that the net effect of the ruling would be an approximately 2.5-3.5% decrease in 2016 total revenue since this pricing is being applied partially from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 and will be applied completely starting on July 1, 2016.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\n\nWe manufacture our products in our Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas facilities. Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to quality and customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $22.9 million to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 59.1% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material costs for our products associated with design changes, better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales revenue as a percentage of sales revenue in future periods to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $2.9 million to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 15.6% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental asset depreciation, repair costs, disposables, product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of rental revenue included $12.0 million of rental asset depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin decreased to 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in sales revenue gross margin was primarily related to a shift in sales mix towards lower margin business-to-business customer sales domestically versus direct-to-consumer sales which carry higher gross margins. The increased demand from domestic business-to-business channels was primarily the result of the introduction of private label sales intended to increase volume and market share at lower average selling prices, increased reseller demand, and strategic price concessions in our business-to-business channels worldwide primarily due to increased volume and currency fluctuations. While the change in mix drove higher total sales revenue, there was an overall 8.8% decline in revenue per sales unit, which had a negative impact on gross margin. This was partially offset by a decrease in overall sales cost of goods sold per unit sold of 6.7%, largely driven by lower material and freight costs.\nRental revenue gross margin decreased slightly to 53.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014, largely due to slight declines in net rental revenue per patient.\nThe overall gross margin decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decline was consistent with the overall mix of sales and rental revenue as discussed above.\nResearch and development expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased $1.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 40.4% over the prior year. As a percent of revenue, research and development expense was essentially flat at 2.6% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in personnel-related expenses for engineering projects and $0.3 million for product development expense.\nWe expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our engineering and technology teams to support our new and enhanced product research and development efforts and manufacturing line support, including our efforts related to the new Inogen One G4.\nSales and marketing expense\n\nSales and marketing expense increased $7.3 million to $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 30.2% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to $4.4 million of sales and marketing personnel-related expenses as a result of increased headcount to support the growth of our business (which included $2.3 million of wages and payroll tax expense, $0.8 million of commissions and bonus expense, and $0.6 million additional stock compensation expense), $0.9 million of additional media/printing expenses and $0.8 million in higher credit card processing fees. We also incurred an additional $0.7 million in personnel-related costs for our client services and clinical teams as well as $0.3 million for non-warranty repair costs. In the year ended 2015, we spent $4.7 million in media and advertising costs compared to $3.3 million in the comparative period in 2014.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our business, including expanding our sales and sales support team, increasing media spend to drive consumer awareness, and increasing patient support costs as our patient base increases.\nGeneral and administrative expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $7.7 million to $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or an increase of 43.0% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to $3.0 million of personnel-related expenses as a result of increased headcount in billing, finance, information technology, human resources and compliance (which included an additional $1.1 million of stock compensation expense and an additional $1.9 million of wages, bonus and payroll tax expense), $1.0 million of bad debt expense primarily related to our rental revenues, $1.9 million of audit/tax/legal fees ($1.8 million was for the audit committee investigation and class action lawsuit that were both concluded in the second quarter of 2015) and $1.6 million of additional outside services, dues, and insurance expense. Bad debt expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, was 1.7% and 1.5% in the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nWe expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure to support our growth and our operation as a public company, including personnel-related expenses, professional services fees and compliance costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, as our patient base increases, we expect our billing and administration costs to increase in absolute dollars and our bad debt expense to increase in absolute dollars as our revenue increases.\nOther income (expense), net\n\nTotal other expense, net, decreased to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in interest expense associated with outstanding bank debt balances which were paid off during the third quarter of 2014, partially offset by the increase in loss on foreign currency transactions related to the import of our goods into the European Union and other currency translation losses from the sale of goods in Euros. Value added tax (VAT) was also paid in Euros upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed so was subject to Euro currency translation losses. Fluctuations in the Euro currency to the U.S. dollar exchange rate as well as the decrease in interest expense due to lower average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement compared to prior year resulted in a decrease in net other expense in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome tax expense\n\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to tax benefit adjustments of $1.6 million mainly related to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to California net operating losses recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and an increase in equity compensation deductions. The tax provision from 2014 included a tax benefit adjustment of $0.3 million primarily related to a decrease in the valuation allowance related to net operating losses. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes to $14.7 million in 2015 compared to $10.1 million in 2014.\nNet income\n\nThe increase in net income was primarily related to the increase in revenues of 41.3% over the prior year, and the decrease in the effective tax rate to 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 32.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our sales may be impacted by seasonal factors. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months. The following table summarizes our quarterly net sales, gross profit and income from operations:\n\n\nComparison of years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenue\n\nSales revenue increased $28.2 million to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 62.8% over the comparable year. The increase was attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold primarily related to expansion of the Inogen One G3 product line, an increase in direct-to-consumer sales in the United States due to increased sales and marketing efforts, and an increase in business-to-business sales worldwide as the adoption of portable oxygen concentrators improved. As we expected, the growth in sales revenue was not materially impacted by the reduced reimbursement rates resulting from competitive bidding.\nRental revenue increased $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 29.2% over the comparable year. The increase was attributable to the increase in rental patients to 28,400 as of December 31, 2014 from 21,300 as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to additional marketing efforts and increased sales personnel. This increase was partially offset by the reduced reimbursement rates resulting from round two competitive bidding that became effective on July 1, 2013 and round one re-compete competitive bidding that became effective January 1, 2014.\n\nDomestic sales in business-to-business and direct-to-consumer increased 87.2% and 64.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in domestic business-to-business sales was a result of increased consumer demand for our products due to the hiring of the additional internal sales representatives in the fourth quarter of 2014, our marketing efforts and the marketing efforts of our partners. The increase in direct-to-consumer sales was primarily a result of our additional internal sales representative hires, our refocus on direct-to-consumer sales versus rental set-ups, and strong consumer demand for our products.\nThe business-to-business international sales increased 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to continued strong demand primarily in Europe and partially due to the approval of our Inogen One G3 system for reimbursement in France and Germany in the second half of 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we sold our products in 44 countries outside of the United States, and we plan to continue to expand our presence in other countries as the opportunities present themselves. Of our international sales revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, 87.6% was in Europe.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\n\nWe manufacture our products in our Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas facilities. Our manufacturing process includes final assembly, testing, and packaging to customer specifications. The cost of sales revenue increased $14.4 million to $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 59.2% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of sales revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold, partially offset by reduced bill of material and labor and overhead costs for our products associated with better sourcing and increased volumes. We expect the cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue to fluctuate based on customer mix, product mix, and changes in sales prices and cost of goods sold.\nThe cost of rental revenue increased $6.2 million to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 50.9% over the comparable year. The increase in cost of rental revenue was attributable to an increase of rental patients and related rental assets, depreciation and product exchange and logistics costs. Cost of\nrental revenue included $10.3 million of rental asset depreciation for year ended December 31, 2014 versus $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross margin is defined as revenue less costs of revenue divided by revenue. Sales revenue gross margin increased to 47.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 45.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in sales revenue gross margin was partially due to increased sales mix toward our higher margin Inogen One G3 as compared to our Inogen One G2, and the continued shift towards direct-to-consumer sales revenue in our revenue mix. Rental revenue gross margin decreased to 53.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 60.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to lower rental reimbursement rates resulting from round two competitive bidding that became effective July 1, 2013 and round one re-compete competitive bidding that became effective January 1, 2014. The overall gross margin decreased to 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decline was consistent with the mix in sales revenue gross margin and the decline in rental revenue gross margin.\nResearch and development expense\n\nResearch and development expense increased $0.6 million to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 24.1% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses which included $0.3 million additional bonus expense and $0.2 million additional stock compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in other research and development related costs.\nSales and marketing expense\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $5.7 million to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 31.1% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to $2.9 million of personnel-related expenses as a result of increased sales and marketing headcount to support the growth of our business, $1.3 million of media-related marketing and software licensing costs, $0.5 million of personnel-related and outside services expenses for customer care and clinical services to support our increased rental patient base, $0.4 million of sales incentives and giveaways, $0.3 million of higher credit card processing fees, and $0.3 million of higher facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing as well as other general expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or an increase of 30.4% over the comparable year. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.7 million of personnel-related expenses as a result of increased headcount in billing, finance, information technology, human resources and compliance, $0.8 million of costs associated with being a public company in 2014, $0.4 million of legal costs, $0.4 million of licenses and fees, $0.3 million of depreciation, $0.2 million of bank charges, $0.2 million of patent defense costs, $0.2 million of information technology professional fees, and $0.2 million of state franchise taxes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $0.4 million. Bad debt expense, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, was 1.5% and 2.7% in the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nOther income (expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net, decreased $0.2 million to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or a decrease of 25.5% over the comparable year. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense in 2014, which was driven by the decrease in average debt balances under our revolving credit and term loan agreement in 2014 compared to the prior year. Other income, net, in 2013 was primarily associated with investment income received in connection with the sale of our interest in our former product liability insurance company. This other income was not expected to recur in future periods. Other expense, net, in 2014 consisted primarily of loss on foreign currency transactions related to the import of our goods into the European Union. Value added tax (VAT) was paid upon import, reclaimed, and reimbursed in Euros. Fluctuations in the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate resulted in a net expense. The increase in preferred stock warrant liability was due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrants outstanding through a Monte Carlo valuation model due to higher enterprise value and the increased likelihood of an initial public offering during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the change in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2013. As of September 30, 2013, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its federal and state deferred tax assets. In December of 2013, the Company evaluated its facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release valuation allowances, which created a tax benefit adjustment of $21.8 million.\nNet income\n\nThe decrease in net income for the year ended 2014 compared to the year ended 2013 primarily related to the release of valuation allowances, which created a tax benefit adjustment of $21.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. These tax benefits were partially offset by an increase in income before provision (benefit) for income taxes to $10.1 million in 2014 compared to $3.8 million in 2013.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our sales may be impacted by seasonal factors. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months. The following table summarizes our quarterly net sales, gross profit and income from operations:\n\n\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $66.1 million, which consisted of highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less. In addition, we held $16.8 million in certificates of deposits which had maturities greater than ninety days, but less than twelve months, and which were classified as short-term investments. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, from borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million debt outstanding in patent licensing debt. Since inception, we have received net proceeds of $91.7 million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock and $52.5 million ($49.7 million net proceeds) in connection with the sale of common stock in our initial public offering.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15.0 million working capital revolving line of credit and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three-year working capital revolving line of credit which replaced the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica Bank. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.25%.\nPursuant to the revolving credit agreement, we are subject to certain financial covenants relating to our net worth and EBITDA. Tangible net worth under the revolving credit agreement is calculated by subtracting the sum of intangible assets and total liabilities from total assets. EBITDA is defined in the revolving credit agreement as our net income plus interest expense, plus depreciation expense, plus amortization expense, plus income tax expense, plus non-cash expense, plus extraordinary losses, minus non-cash income, and minus extraordinary gains, as computed during certain test periods provided in the revolving credit agreement. We are required to maintain at all times a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and EBITDA (i) of $10.0 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014 through the four-quarter test period ending March 31, 2016 and (ii) of $12.5 million for any four-quarter test period commencing with the four-quarter test period ending June 30, 2016 and continuing thereafter.\nThe agreement contains events of default customary for transactions of this type, including non-payment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, and bankruptcy. In the event we fail to satisfy our covenants, or otherwise go into default, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has a number of remedies, including sale of our assets and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Certain of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2015, in order to be in compliance with the EBITDA and tangible net worth requirements, we were required to maintain $10.0 million in EBITDA for the preceding test period, and we had $32.4 million in EBITDA for that period. In addition, we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of $90.0 million and we had a tangible net worth of $133.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $15.0 million in available debt capacity under the revolving facility.\nOur principal uses of cash in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of the funding of our capital expenditures including additional rental assets of $10.2 million and the net purchase of available-for-sale investments of $16.8 million. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, available borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan agreement and the cash to be generated from expected product sales and rentals, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and investing requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our\navailable financial resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nIf we require additional funds in the future, we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms, or at all. In the future, we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, which would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if our operating performance during the next twelve months is below our expectations, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nThe following tables show a summary of our cash flows and working capital for the periods indicated:\n\n\nOperating activities\nWe derive operating cash flows from cash collected from the sales and rental of our products and services. These cash flows received are partially offset by our use of cash for operating expenses to support the growth of our business. Net income in each period has increased associated with increased sales, improving product mix and lower costs of revenues. In addition, operating expense leverage has increased as expenses have not grown as quickly as revenues due to improved operating efficiencies. The changes in cash related to operating assets and liabilities discussed below were primarily due to the following factors that occurred across all periods: an increase in cash used related to inventory to support our growth in revenue; an increase in cash used by accounts receivable resulting from growth in rental receivables which typically have a longer collection cycle; and an increase in cash related to accounts payable resulting from the higher level of operating expenses needed to support the higher sales level.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of our net income of $11.6 million adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization of our equipment and leasehold improvements of $14.0 million, provision for rental revenue adjustments of $8.5 million, deferred tax assets of $4.8 million, provision for sales returns of $4.9 million, stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million and loss on disposal of rental units of $1.2 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net decrease in cash of $14.9 million, of which $19.0 million was due to a net increase in accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets during this period, a net increase of $1.7 million in income tax receivable, partially offset by a net increase of $2.0 million of deferred revenue, $1.6 million of accounts payable, $1.2 million of accrued payroll and $0.1 million of the warranty reserve.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for each of the periods presented was primarily related to the production and purchase of rental assets, manufacturing tooling, and computer equipment and software to support our expanding business. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, net cash used in investing activities also included the net purchase of available-for-sale investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $36.6 million primarily in certificates of deposits with maturities greater than ninety days and less than twelve months that were classified as short-term investments, partially offset by $19.8 million in maturities of available-for-sale investments. In addition, we invested $10.2 million in rental assets and $2.2 million in other property, equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nWe expect to continue investing in property and equipment as we expand our operations. Our business is inherently capital intensive. For example, we expend significant manufacturing and production expense in connection with the development and production of our oxygen concentrator products and, in connection with our rental business, we incur expense in the deployment of rental products to our patients. Investments will continue to be required in order to grow our revenue.\nFinancing activities\nHistorically, we have funded our operations through our sales and rental revenue, the issuance of preferred and common stock, and the incurrence of indebtedness.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $2.3 million from the proceeds of stock options that were exercised and purchases under our employee stock purchase program. This was partially offset by $1.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements on the exercise of employee stock options and $0.3 million of payments on our contractual obligation.\nAccounts receivable\nGross accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts, rental adjustments and sales returns increased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $26.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $23.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nIncluded in accounts receivable were earned but held and unbilled receivables of $5.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays, ranging from a day to several weeks between the date of service, and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor-specific documentation from internal and external sources. Earned but held and unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from some payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. These adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review.\nManagement performs analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable. Specifically, management considers historical realization data, accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry and third-party reimbursement, it is possible that management's estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows.\nWe derive a significant portion of our rental revenue from Medicare. Revenue is recognized at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by payors and patients. Our billing system contains payor-specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect\nor contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer. For Medicare and Medicaid revenue, as well as most other third-party payors, final payment is subject to administrative review and audit. We make estimated provisions for adjustments, including adjustments from administrative review and audit, based on historical experience. We closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws, rules and regulations and contract terms in an attempt to use the most accurate information available in determining these provisions. However, due to the complexities involved in these estimates, actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record.\nCollection of rental receivables from third-party payors and patients is a significant source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid, but patient responsibility amounts (generally deductibles and co-insurance) remain outstanding. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs and aging of accounts receivable. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when all collection efforts (including payor appeals processes) have been exhausted. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical contractual adjustments and bad debt rates and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as provision for doubtful accounts.\nGross accounts receivable balance concentrations by major category as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows:\n\nNet accounts receivable (gross accounts receivable net of allowances) balance concentrations by major category as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were as follows:\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage breakdown of our net accounts receivable (gross accounts receivable net of allowances) by aging category by invoice date as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage breakdown of our allowances to accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\nThe increase in total percentage of our allowances to accounts receivable to 23.6% as of December 31, 2015 from 16.2% as of December 31, 2014 was primarily related to the increase in patient responsibility and growth of our held and unbilled accounts receivable balances and the increased age of Medicare related receivables. We have increased billing staff to decrease past-due balances and held and unbilled to 66 as of December 31, 2015 from 52 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have implemented new collection procedures with third-party collection agencies to achieve higher collectability rates, as well as timelier payment processing from Medicare, Medicaid and third-party, payors whereby they assist with the follow-up and completion of additional requests from these payors to expedite payment. We believe our reserves are adequate and properly present the collectability of our outstanding accounts receivable balances based on our analysis of these balances. We review the accounts receivables on a monthly basis to assess the allowance for doubtful accounts, and adjust the reserves accordingly.\nThe ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months due to the time required for claims to be processed by the payors and patients, and for additional documentation to be submitted in the case of denials, which may further prolong the collection process. In addition, certain receivables are transferred to a third-party processor and we cannot anticipate the timing of those collections or whether they will be successful. We record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical data specific to us. The percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses, including current and historical cash collections, bad debt write-offs, aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor-specific concerns. The determination that an account is uncollectible and the ultimate write-off of that account occurs once collection is considered to be highly unlikely, and it is written-off and charged to the allowance at that time.\nWe do not use an aging threshold for account receivable write-offs. However, the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted, and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write-off.\nSources of funds\nOur cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was $38.2 million compared to $15.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $66.1 million and available borrowing capacity under our working capital revolving line of credit of $15.0 million.\nWe believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, operating expenses and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may make material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income excluding interest income, interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the change in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability and stock-based compensation. Below, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other\norganizations may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income in the same manner as we calculate these measures.\nWe include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are important measures upon which our management assesses our operating performance. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income as key performance measures because we believe they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences primarily caused by variations in capital structures, tax positions, the impact of depreciation and amortization expense on our fixed assets, changes related to the fair value re-measurements of our preferred stock warrants, and the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income for business planning purposes, to incentivize and compensate our management personnel, and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies, and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities.\nOur uses of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments; \n \u00b7 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; \n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u00b7 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and \n \u00b7 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. \nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by certain expenses. When evaluating our performance, you should consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income alongside other financial performance measures, including other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to our net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\n\n \n\n (1) The pro-forma non-GAAP EPS calculations give effect to: (1) the automatic conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock into a weighted-average of 14,219,001 and 14,057,509 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, (2) the cash exercise of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 46,042 and 142,495 shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n (2) See Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of the calculations of our basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders and pro-forma net income per share attributable to common stockholders. \n (3) Tax benefit adjustments related to the release and adjustment of the valuation allowances associated with the net operating loss carryforwards for years ended December 31 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \nAmended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement\nIn October 2012, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement with Comerica Bank as the administrative agent, which we refer to as our Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement. This agreement incorporated amounts outstanding under one prior loan agreement whereby the existing balances and the payback terms were not changed. This transaction did not result in any debt extinguishment losses or gains. We did not incur or defer any financing cost directly related to the amended loan and security agreement.\nThe Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement also provided for a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $3.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan A, a pre-existing term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $8.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan B, a new term loan facility for rental assets amounting to up to $12.0 million, which we refer to as Term Loan C, and an accounts receivable revolving line of credit amounting to up to $1.0 million based on 80% of eligible accounts receivable, which we refer to as the revolver.\nWe had borrowings of $0, $0 and $0.4 million outstanding under Term Loan A as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $3.8 million outstanding under Term Loan B, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had borrowings of $0, $0 and $5.7 million outstanding under Term Loan C as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPayments of interest for the Term Loan were generally payable monthly. Payment of principal is payable monthly. Each term loan bears interest at the base rate, which is a rate equal to the applicable margin plus the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate, as defined in the agreement, plus 1%, and (iii) the daily adjusting LIBOR rate, plus 1%. The applicable margins for Term Loans A, B and C are 1.25%, 2.50% and 2.25%, respectively. Upon the closing of an acquisition or initial public offering during the term of the revolving credit and term loan agreement, the lenders were entitled to a fee equal to $120,000. This fee was initiated upon the close of the IPO that occurred in February, 2014, and was subsequently paid in March, 2014 and is recorded as other finance and bank fees in 2014. The Comerica revolving credit and term loan agreement expired in October 2013.\nIn November 2014, we secured a primary banking relationship that provides access to a $15 million working capital revolving line of credit, and treasury and cash management services through commercial banking with JP Morgan Chase. This agreement is a three year working capital revolving line of credit which replaces the previous loan facility we maintained with Comerica. The interest rate on outstanding debt balances is LIBOR plus 1.25%. We are required to maintain a tangible net worth not less than $90 million and EBITDA of $10 million for any period of four consecutive quarters commencing with the four-quarter test period ending September 30, 2014. We were in compliance as of December 31, 2015, and no outstanding debt balances were outstanding on the credit facility.\nThe revolving credit and term loan agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default and covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other entities, incur indebtedness, incur\nencumbrances, make distributions to holders of our capital stock, make investments, engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition, we must comply with certain financial covenants relating to liquidity, debt service, and leverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our obligations under the revolving credit and term loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property.\nWe may from time to time, depending upon market conditions and financing needs, seek to refinance or repurchase our debt securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nUse of funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding our new rental asset deployments and other capital purchases, operations, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments, and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, our revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, our cash flows from customer collections have increased as have our profits. As a result, our cash provided by operating activities has increased over time and now is a source of capital to the business. We expect operating activities to continue to be a source of capital to the business in the future.\nDue to the portion of our business that drives rental revenue, which needs continuing asset deployments to net new patients, our cash used in investing activities has increased over time. We expect our investment cash requirements to increase in the future as we increase our rental patient base and deploy rental assets among Medicare and private payors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to support our investing operations, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nContractual obligations\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015.\n\n (1) We lease manufacturing and office space in Richardson, TX, Goleta, CA, Smyrna, TN, Huntsville, AL, Aurora, CO and Middleburg Heights, OH with terms that expire between 2017 and 2022. \n (2) This consists of miscellaneous office and processing equipment in both Texas and California with terms expiring within 10 months to 5 years. \n (3) In 2011, we entered into an amendment to a licensing agreement whereby we were assigned the entire right, title and interest in a portfolio of patents in exchange for an imputed promissory note calculated via prime plus 2 points for $0.7 million, in addition to a $0.8 million existing obligation to the original licensor, for a total of $1.5 million due to the original licensor in installments starting May 22, 2011, and ending October 31, 2016. \n (4) We obtain individual components for our products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective suppliers. As of December 31, 2015, we had purchase obligations of $23.0 million of which timing of those obligations vary depending on demand, current supply on hand and other factors. The obligations normally do not extend beyond twelve month time-frames. \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 million which were netted in noncurrent deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million. The\ntable does not include any payments related to liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any other payments. See Note 6 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical accounting policies and significant estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to:\n \u25cf revenue recognition \n \u25cf stock-based compensation \n \u25cf inventory and rental asset valuation \n \u25cf accounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns and adjustments \n \u25cf income taxes \nRevenue recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales and rentals of our products. Our products consist of our proprietary line of oxygen concentrators and related accessories. A small portion of our revenue comes from extended service contracts and freight revenue for product shipments.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonable assured. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product. Provisions for estimated returns and discounts are made at the time of shipment. Provisions for warranty obligations, which are included in cost of sales revenue, are also provided for at the time of shipment.\nAccruals for estimated warranty expenses are made at the time that the associated revenue is recognized. We use judgment to estimate these accruals and, if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our products under warranty were greater than our estimates, our cost of revenue could be adversely affected in future periods. The provisions for estimated returns, discounts and warranty obligations are made based on known claims and discount commitments and estimates of additional returns and warranty obligations based on historical data and future expectations. We had accrued $2.0 million and $1.1 million to provide for future warranty costs at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRevenue from the sale of used rental equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured and other revenue recognition criteria are met. When a rental unit is sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gains or losses are included in gross profit.\nRevenue from the sales of our services is recognized when no significant obligations remain undelivered and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured, which is generally when risks and rewards of the product have transferred to the buyer, generally upon receipt of the product. We offer extended service contracts on our Inogen One systems for periods ranging from 12 to 24 months after the end of the standard warranty period. Revenue from extended service contracts and lifetime warranty is deferred and recognized in income over the contract period. To calculate the value associated with the lifetime warranties, management considered the profit margins of the overall company, the average cost of lifetime warranties and the price of extended warranties and created a best estimate. Lifetime warranty revenue is deferred and recognized after the standard three year warranty period, on a straight-line basis, in year four and five. Under the lifetime warranty, the company will provide replacement equipment without any additional cost to the consumer for the duration of the patient's life. Lifetime warranties are non-transferable.\nWe recognize equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which is one month, less estimated adjustments, per ASC 840-Leases. We have separate contracts with each patient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any payor. We evaluate the individual lease contracts at lease inception and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if there is reasonable assurance that the bargain renewal option associated with the potential capped free rental period would be exercised. Historically, the exercise of such bargain renewal option is not reasonably assured at lease inception and most subsequent monthly lease renewal periods. If we determine that the reasonable assurance threshold for an individual patient is met at lease inception or at a monthly lease renewal period, such determination would impact the bargain renewal period for an individual lease. We would first consider the lease classification (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease term, which may include a portion of the capped rental period. To date, we have not deferred any amounts associated with the capped rental period. Amounts related to the capped rental period have not been material in the periods presented.\nThe lease term begins on the date products are shipped to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including Medicare, private payors, and Medicaid. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application, claim denial or account review. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received, although product was delivered and revenue was earned. Upon determination that an account is uncollectible, it is written-off and charged to the allowance. Amounts billed but not earned due to the timing of the billing cycle are deferred and recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the monthly billing period. For example, if the first day of the billing period does not fall on the first of the month, then a portion of the monthly billing period will fall in the subsequent month and the related revenue and cost would be deferred based on the service days in the following month.\nRental revenue is recognized as earned, less estimated adjustments. Revenue not billed at the end of the period is reviewed for the likelihood of collections and accrued. The rental revenue stream is not guaranteed and payment will cease if the patient no longer needs oxygen or returns the equipment. Revenue recognized is at full estimated allowable reimbursement rates. Rental revenue is earned for that month if the patient is on service on the first day of the 30-day period commencing on the recurring date of service for a particular claim, regardless if there is a change in condition/death after that date. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services. We have determined that the balances are collectable at the time of revenue recognition because the patient signs a notice of financial responsibility outlining their obligations.\nIncluded in rental revenue are unbilled amounts that were earned but not able to be billed for various reasons. The criteria for recognizing revenue had been met as of period-end, but there were specific reasons why we were unable to bill Medicare and private insurance for these amounts. As a result, we create an unbilled rental revenue accrual based on these earned revenues not billed based on a percentage of unbilled amounts and historical trends and estimates of future collectability.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date represents management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value, prior to the IPO, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\n \u25cf Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Prior to the IPO our common stock was not publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of the common stock as discussed in Pre-IPO Common Stock Valuations\u201d below. Following our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock. \n \u25cf Expected Term. The expected term for stock options granted to employees (including members of our board of directors) was estimated using the simplified method allowed under SEC guidance. For grants to non-employees, the expected term is equal to the contractual term, which have ranged from seven to ten years. \n \u25cf Expected Volatility. Given the limited trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers, which we have designated, based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have designated, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \u25cf Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \u25cf Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nPre-IPO common stock valuations\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was approved by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share equal to the per-share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, the board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:\n \u25cf contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; \n \u25cf the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of preferred stock relative to the common stock; \n \u25cf the prices of preferred stock sold to third-party investors in arms-length transactions; \n \u25cf the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions; \n \u25cf our operating and financial performance; \n \u25cf current business conditions and projections; \n \u25cf our stage of development; \n \u25cf the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions; \n \u25cf any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for common stock; \n \u25cf the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and \n \u25cf the U.S. and global capital market conditions. \nIn order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants issued, we determined the enterprise value, added net cash, then allocated the equity value to each class of equity securities outstanding (preferred stock, common stock and options).\nInventory and rental asset valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, certain component parts to be used in manufacturing our products and finished goods. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, including material, labor, and manufacturing overhead, whereby the standard costs are updated at least quarterly to approximate actual costs using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value. We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete, slow-moving or impaired items. The business environment in which we operate is subject to changes in technology and customer demand. We review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components at least quarterly, taking into account product life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.\nRental assets are valued at standard cost to manufacture or purchase the product, including appropriate labor and overhead. Costs are reviewed at least quarterly to confirm standard costs approximate actual costs using the FIFO method. Rental assets are depreciated over the life of the asset, typically 18 months to 60 months. Rental asset disposals or losses are recorded at net book value in cost of rental revenue.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for bad debts, returns, and adjustments\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal sales and rental terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that, in our opinion, is adequate to absorb potential losses related to account receivables and is based upon our continuous evaluation of the collectability of outstanding balances. Our evaluation takes into consideration such factors as past bad debt experience, economic conditions, and information about specific receivables. Our evaluation also considers the age and composition of the outstanding amount in determining their net realizable values. The allowance is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods that they become known. The allowance is increased by bad debt provisions charged to operating expense and reduced by direct write-offs, net of recoveries. In the event that a third-party payor does not accept the claim for payment, the consumer is ultimately responsible for payment for the products and services.\nIn general, our allowance for doubtful accounts is higher for our rental revenue compared to our sales revenue. The nature of our rental business necessitates a larger bad debt reserve against billings, as a higher percentage of our billed revenue may never be collected as a result of the failure of some patients to pay their co-insurance and deductible obligations and some billing disputes with payors.\nProvision for sales returns applies to direct-to-consumer sales only. We do not allow returns from providers. This reserve is calculated based on actual historical return rates under our 30-day return program and is applied to the current period's sales revenue for direct-to-consumer sales. We have experienced a small increase in the historical returns rate during the period, primarily due to increased competition among other providers and resellers and a slight increase in product failures in the relevant periods.\nWe also record an allowance for rental revenue adjustments and write-offs, which is recorded as a reduction of rental revenue and rental accounts receivable balances. These adjustments and write offs result from contractual adjustments, audit adjustments, or billing not paid due to another provider performing same or similar functions for the patient in the same period, all of which prevent billed revenue to become realizable. The reserve is based on historical revenue adjustments as a percentage of rental revenue billed during the related period.\nIncluded in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of $5.2 million in December 31, 2015 and $3.7 million at December 31, 2014. Delays in billing can occur between the date revenue is earned and when billing occurs due to delays in receiving the appropriate paperwork for each payor. Earned but unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectability. A portion of revenue and related costs are deferred each month for monthly rental revenue based on the timing of the recurring billing and then recorded as revenue in the subsequent month.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the future tax consequences of transactions that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertainties in income tax in accordance with ASC 740-10-Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This accounting standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nWe recognize interest and penalties on taxes, if any, within operations as income tax expense. No significant interest or penalties were recognized during the periods presented.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $58.4 million and $39.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that begin to expire in 2023 and 2016 for federal and state purposes, respectively, if not utilized. As of December 31, 2015, we have federal and California research and development credit carryforward of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The federal credit will begin to expire in 2022; the California credit has indefinite carryforward.\nOur existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to limitations arising from ownership changes subject to the provisions of Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and if we undergo one or more future ownership changes our ability to utilize net operating losses could be further limited.\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. Due to overall cumulative losses incurred over the years, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we evaluated the current facts and circumstances and concluded that it was appropriate to release $22.9 million of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were able to determine that, based upon future projections of income, it is more likely than not that all of our federal net operating losses will be utilized before they expire. However, we determined that it is more likely than not that some of our California net operating losses will expire unused and therefore we have a valuation allowance of $1.7 million relating to these net operating losses as of December 31, 2015. In the current period, we released (or reversed) $1.2 million of the California NOLs valuation allowance due to expiration of California NOLs and changes in estimates of future projections of income, resulting in a determination that it is more likely than not that all but $29.8 million ($1.7 million tax effected) of the California net operating losses are more likely than not to be utilized.\nWe operate in multiple states. The statute of limitations has expired for all tax years prior to 2012 for federal and 2011 to 2012 for various state tax purposes. However, the net operating loss generated on the federal and state tax returns in prior years may be subject to adjustments by the federal and state tax authorities.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.\nIn August 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the Company's pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which the Company will adopt the standard.\nInventory\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\u201d thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nInterest\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this update as of the year ended December 31, 2015 with no effect to our financial statements.\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software - Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. The update provides guidance on fees paid by an entity in a cloud computing arrangement and whether an arrangement includes a license to the underlying software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the entity should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the entity should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a statement of financial position. We early-adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net noncurrent deferred tax asset in our Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842).\" The new guidance will require organizations that lease assets-referred to as lessees\u201d-to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. This will increase the reported assets and liabilities - in some cases very significantly. ASU No. 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new lease recognition guidance, and have not yet determined the impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEmerging Growth Company\nAs an emerging growth company\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management over our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company\u201d if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively, which could result in a loss of\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for any other contractually narrow or limited purpose. However, from time to time we enter into certain types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third-party claims including certain real estate leases, supply purchase agreements, and directors and officers. The terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a maximum dollar amount is not explicitly stated therein. Generally, amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted thus no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheets for any of the periods presented.\nInflation\nWe experience pricing pressures in the form of continued reductions in reimbursement rates, particularly from governmental payors such as Medicare or Medicaid but also private payors. We can also be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor and employee benefits. However, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases, especially in contracts where pricing is fixed over a specific period. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 153: <table> <tr> <td> Region Name\n</td> <td>\n</td>

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Revenue increased 41.3% to $159.0 million in 2015, driven by growth in sales and rental revenue. Sales revenue increased due to higher sales of oxygen systems, while rental revenue rose due to more rental patients. \n\n- Gross margin declined from 49.3% in 2014 to 48.0% in 2015, primarily due to lower average selling prices and a shift in sales mix towards lower margin business-to-business sales. \n\n- Operating expenses increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of revenue due to improved operating leverage. R&D costs rose due to more engineering projects, while sales & marketing and G&A expenses grew largely due to increased headcount.\n\n- Net income increased 69.7% to $11.6 million in 2015, helped by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate of 21.3% versus 32.1% in 2014.\n\n- The company has continued to generate positive cash flow from operations, which helps fund capital investments in rental assets and new product development. \n\n- As of December 31, 2015, the company had $66.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and access to a $15 million revolving credit facility, providing liquidity to support growth plans.\n\nIn summary, the company showed strong growth in 2015 driven by increased demand. Profitability improved as well, aided by operating leverage, despite some gross margin pressure. The company appears to be in a solid financial position to continue investing for further expansion."}
