Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those mentioned in this report and, in particular, the factors described in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\u201d Landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report.\nOverview\nLandec Corporation and its subsidiaries ( Landec\u201d or the Company\u201d) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated products for food and biomaterials markets and license technology applications to partners. The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: 1) Intelimer polymers, and 2) hyaluronan ( HA\u201d) biopolymers. The Company's HA biopolymers and non-HA materials are proprietary in that they are specially formulated for specific customers to meet strict regulatory requirements. The Company's polymer technologies, along with its customer relationships and trade names, are the foundation, and a key differentiating advantage upon which Landec has built its business. The Company sells specialty packaged branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut vegetables and whole produce to retailers, club stores and foodservice operators, primarily in the United States, Canada and Asia through its Apio, Inc. ( Apio\u201d) subsidiary and sells HA and non-HA based biomaterials through its Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. ( Lifecore\u201d) subsidiary.\nLandec has three operating segments - Packaged Fresh Vegetables, Food Export, and Biomaterials. The Packaged Fresh Vegetables segment combines the Company's BreatheWay packaging technology with Apio's branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut and whole produce business. The Food Export business is operated through Apio's Cal-Ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly Asian markets. The Biomaterials business sells products utilizing HA in the ophthalmic, orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies HA to customers pursuing other medical applications, such as aesthetic surgery, medical device coatings, tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals. In addition, Lifecore provides specialized aseptic fill and finish services in a cGMP validated manufacturing facility for supplying commercial, clinical and pre-clinical products. See \"Business - Description of Business Segments\".\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company's retained earnings were $73.5 million. The Company may incur losses in the future. The amount of future net profits, if any, is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain profitability in future years.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require management's most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition; sales returns and allowances; self-insurance liabilities; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets; the valuation of intangible assets and inventory; the valuation of investments; and the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation.\nThese estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments. The analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. The actual results may differ from management's estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value, provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. These provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve, based on historical losses, for inventory currently considered to be usable.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title has transferred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts, product returns, and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses.\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues generally consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole vegetable products that are generally washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of these products to customers. The Company takes title to all produce it sells and/or packages, and therefore, records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nIn addition, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners. Revenue is recognized on the vegetable cooling operations as cooling and storage services are provided to our customers. Sales of BreatheWay packaging are recognized when shipped to our customers.\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. As most Cal-Ex customers are in countries outside of the U.S., title transfers and revenue is generally recognized upon arrival of the shipment in the foreign port. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nOur Biomaterials business principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA and non-HA materials. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016. The vast majority of revenues from our Biomaterials business are recognized upon shipment.\nLifecore's business development revenues, a portion of which are included in all three medical areas, are related to contract research and development (R&D) services and multiple element arrangement services with customers where the Company provides products and/or services in a bundled arrangement.\nContract R&D revenue is recorded as earned, based on the performance requirements of the contract. Non-refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and there is no continuing involvement by the Company, are recognized on the earlier of when the payment is received or collection is assured.\nFor sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, the Company splits the arrangement into separate units of accounting if the individually delivered elements have value to the customer on a standalone basis. The Company also evaluates whether multiple transactions with the same customer or related party should be considered part of a multiple element arrangement, whereby the Company assesses, among other factors, whether the contracts or agreements are negotiated or executed within a short time frame of each other or if there are indicators that the contracts are negotiated in contemplation of each other. The Company then allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The relative selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), if available, third-party evidence (TPE), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. The Company is not typically able to determine VSOE or TPE, and therefore, uses the estimated selling price to allocate revenue between the elements of an arrangement.\nThe Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or future performance obligations or subject to customer-specific cancellation rights. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value, and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by the Company. The Company considers a deliverable to have stand-alone value if the product or service is sold separately by the Company or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, the revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. The Company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price. In instances where the Company has not established fair value for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of the final element is completed and all recognition criteria are met.\nLicensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance. Initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Noncancellable, nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement, including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non-substantive at the outset of the arrangement.\nFrom time to time, the Company offers customers sales incentives, which include volume rebates and discounts. These amounts are estimated on a quarterly basis and recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nA summary of revenues by type of revenue arrangement as described above is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded upon shipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded upon acceptance in foreign port\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from multiple element arrangements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,811 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from license fees, R&D contracts and royalties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve to thirteen years and trademarks/trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives (collectively, intangible assets\u201d), which the Company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance (i) upon the acquisition of GreenLine by Apio in April 2012, (ii) upon the acquisition of Lifecore in April 2010 and (iii) upon the acquisition of Apio in December 1999. Accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition.\u201d All intangible assets, including goodwill, associated with the acquisition of Lifecore was allocated to our Biomaterials reporting unit and the acquisitions of Apio and GreenLine were allocated to our Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit. As of May 29, 2016, the Biomaterials reporting unit had $13.9 million of goodwill and the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit had $35.7 million of goodwill.\nThe Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in accordance with accounting guidance. For all indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, the Company performs a qualitative analysis in accordance with ASC 350-30-35. Application of the impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment by management, including identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and assignment of intangible assets to reporting units, which judgments are inherently uncertain.\nDuring the three months ended February 28, 2016, management made the strategic decision to convert its GreenLine branded products in retail grocery stores to the Eat Smart brand. This decision resulted in an impairment of the GreenLine tradename. Management estimated the value of the remaining GreenLine branded foodservice sales using the relief from royalty valuation method, which resulted in an impairment of $34.0 million. The remaining GreenLine tradename associated with the Company's foodservice business is valued at $2.0 million. The impairment charge is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income under Impairment of GreenLine Tradename\u201d as an operating expense under the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit.\nThe Company tested its remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of these assets were necessary as of that date. As a result, it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test at the time. Subsequent to the 2016 annual impairment test, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill. As of May 29, 2016, there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable or that goodwill should be tested for impairment. Therefore, there was no impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. There were no impairment losses for goodwill during fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on management's assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation. Such changes, if significant or material, could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets during the current period. The results of these tests could lead to write-downs of the carrying values of these assets in the current period.\nIn the annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, management considers the impact of these key factors: macro-economic conditions, industry and market environment, overall financial performance of the Company, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If management determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nIf a quantitative test is required, the Company compares the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to its carrying value including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value using both an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the Company and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Under the market-based approach, information regarding the Company is utilized as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples that are used to value each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company's income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. At May 29, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million against deferred tax assets.\nIn addition to valuation allowances, the Company establishes tax-contingency accruals for uncertain tax positions. The tax-contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax-contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management.\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has accrued, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes its tax-contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. The Company's tax-contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company's stock-based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs).\nThe estimated fair value for stock options, which determines the Company's calculation of compensation expense, is based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. In addition, the accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the time of grant. As a result, the Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items measured at fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non-public company (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities.\nThe accounting guidance established a three-tier hierarchy for fair value measurements, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of May 29, 2016, the only asset of the Company that was measured at fair value on a recurring basis was its minority interest investment in Windset.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in Windset. The calculation of fair value utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models, including projected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. As a result, the Company's investment in Windset is considered to be a Level 3 measurement investment. The change in the fair market value of the Company's investment in Windset for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was due to the Company's 26.9% minority interest in the change in the fair market value of Windset during those periods. In determining the fair value of the investment in Windset, the Company utilizes the following significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At May 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At May 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual consolidated revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual consolidated expense growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated income tax rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> <td>to </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe revenue growth, expense growth and income tax rate assumptions, consider the Company's best estimate of the trends in those items over the discount period. The discount rate assumption takes into account the risk-free rate of return, the market equity risk premium and the company's specific risk premium and then applies an additional discount for lack of marketability of the underlying securities. The discounted cash flow valuation model used by the Company has the following sensitivity to changes in inputs and assumptions (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact on value of Windset investment as of May 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in expense growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(600 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in income tax rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of the Company's Windset investment as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was $62.7 million and $61.5 million, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements intended to provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a company's contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2019 with early application permitted in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2018. The standard allows for either full retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect that adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be presented on the consolidated balance sheets as noncurrent. Deferred taxes were previously required to be classified as current or non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective February 28, 2016 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of the Company's net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax liability in its consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2016. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use-assets. ASU 2016-02 also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),\u201d which changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended May 29, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015\nRevenues (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>488,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe decrease in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period of last year was primarily due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales. The volume decrease was due to lower sales in Apio's historical core packaged fresh vegetable business due to a severe shortage of produce during most of the second and third fiscal quarters of 2016, partially offset by increased sales of higher-priced salad kit products. The decrease was also due to fiscal year 2015 having an extra week compared to fiscal year 2016 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 was due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales as a result of produce shortages and the high value of the U.S. dollar compared to most Asian currencies which made our export products more expensive for our foreign customers who pay Apio in U.S. dollars.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016.\nThe increase in Lifecore's revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase of $9.7 million in development service revenues from existing customers, and an increase of $4.6 million in fermentation revenues due primarily to a customer that reduced its purchases last year due to an inventory adjustment resuming their historical purchase levels in fiscal year 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in aseptic revenues of $4.2 million for fiscal year 2016 as a result of lower customer demand primarily due to inventory management initiative put in place by several customers.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These costs include the following: raw materials (including produce, seeds, packaging, syringes and fermentation and purification supplies), direct labor, overhead (including indirect labor, depreciation, and facility related costs) and shipping and shipping-related costs. The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to severe produce shortages resulting from unseasonably warm weather in California throughout most of the second and third quarters of this fiscal year which significantly reduced yields. The excess cost from produce shortages for fiscal year 2016 of approximately $15.6 million more than offset the gross profit generated from a favorable product mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales being generated from the higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin historical core fresh packaged vegetable business.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Food Export business during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to lower revenues partially offset by a favorable product mix. The gross profit as a percent of sales during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 was 6.5% compared to a gross margin of 6.3% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to a 25% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a higher percentage of revenues coming from the higher margin development service revenues and fermentation products than from the lower margin aseptically filled products.\nCorporate\nThe increase in Corporate gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, General and Administrative:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total S,G&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. R&D efforts at Apio are focused on the Company's proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. In the Lifecore business, the R&D efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA-based and non-HA biomaterials. For Corporate, the R&D efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses and on new R&D collaborations with partners.\nThe increase in R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in R&D at Apio and Corporate due primarily to supporting development partners for the Company's BreatheWay membrane technology.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to (1) a 21% increase in S,G&A at Apio primarily to ramp up introduction, product launches, advertising and promotions of our existing and new salad kit products and from additional headcount hired over the past year, (2) a 31% increase at Lifecore primarily due to bonuses being accrued this fiscal year compared to a nominal amount last fiscal year and from headcount additions to support its growth and (3) a 29% increase at Corporate primarily due to the reversal of the $677,000 LTIP accrual last fiscal year and from an increase in stock based compensation as a result of stock option and RSU grants made in May 2015, with the predominate amount of those grants being granted to the new CEO.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,987 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(193 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(181 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe decrease in interest income in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2016 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 is due to the tax benefit from the GreenLine impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and from a decrease in net income before taxes, excluding the GreenLine impairment charge, compared to last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP.\nThe decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nFiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 25, 2014\nRevenues (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>360,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe increase in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 12% increase in unit volume sales resulting primarily from new salad kit products which typically have a higher price per unit than historical offerings. In addition, fiscal year 2015 included an extra week compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 was due to a 9% decrease in unit volume sales primarily as a result of a west coast longshoreman's labor dispute which was partially offset by a favorable product mix to higher priced export products.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 60% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015 and (3) Veterinary/Other.\nThe decrease in Lifecore's revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a 29% decrease in revenues in Lifecore's fermentation business for Ophthalmic products as a result of lower shipments to a major customer as it aligns its inventory levels with newly stated corporate guidelines and a 25% decrease in business development revenues due to the delay in the timing of certain development activities. These decreases were partially offset by increased aseptic filling revenues.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period of last year was not significant.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few.

The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe increase in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the 19% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin core packaged vegetable products. In addition, during fiscal year 2014, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business experienced higher than expected raw produce sourcing costs due to a variety of factors, most importantly the heavy rains in the Midwest and along the East Coast and cooler than normal temperatures in California.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's export business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to a 3% decrease in revenues and from higher costs to source the higher priced export produce resulting in a lower gross profit as a percent of sales. The gross margin during fiscal year 2015 was 6.3% compared to a gross margin of 7.6% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe decrease in gross profit during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the 12% decrease in revenues and from an unfavorable product mix change to a higher percentage of sales being from the lower margin aseptically filled products compared to the higher margin fermentation products and business development revenues in the prior year.\nCorporate\nThe decrease in Corporate gross profit for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, General and Administrative:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total S,G&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives.

In the Lifecore business, the research and development efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA and non-HA based biomaterials. For Corporate, the research and development efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses.\nThe decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in Apio R&D as products move from the development stage to commercialization offset by slight increases in R&D at Lifecore and Corporate.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 20% increase in sales and marketing expenses at Apio primarily to promote our new salad kit products and from the addition of incremental headcount to assist in developing and promoting future products.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,650 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,583 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(181 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(197 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to an $8.1 million net increase in long-term debt during fiscal year 2015.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2015 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In addition, other income during fiscal year 2015 included a $793,000 expense for the write off of the Company's investment in Aesthetic Sciences, Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a 28% decrease in net income before taxes compared to the same period last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP. The decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million, a net decrease of $4.2 million from $14.1 million at May 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nLandec generated $21.8 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 compared to generating $26.2 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2015. The primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 were from (1) $10.1 million of net income, excluding the non-cash impairment charge for the GreenLine trademark of $34.0 million and the tax benefit of $12.5 million from the GreenLine impairment charge, (2) $12.9 million of depreciation/amortization and stock based compensation expenses, and (3) a $2.7 million net increase in deferred tax liabilities, after excluding the tax benefit adjustment from the GreenLine impairment charge, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in the investment in Windset and a net increase of $2.5 million in working capital.\nThe primary factors which increased working capital during fiscal year 2016 were (1) a $4.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to a $5.7 million decrease at Apio due to the timing of payments and (2) a $1.3 million decrease in accrued compensation as a result of fiscal year 2015 bonuses being paid in fiscal year 2016 and no bonuses being accrued in fiscal year 2016 for Apio and Corporate executive management. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities due to an increase in operating expenses and inventory reserves for unusable film and packaging as a result of lost customer business.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $41.6 million compared to $34.4 million for the same period last year. The primary uses of cash in investing activities during fiscal year 2016 were for $40.9 million of expenditures for facility expansions and the purchase of equipment primarily to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Vegetables and Lifecore businesses. Included in the use of cash from investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was an additional $18.0 million investment in Windset.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $15.6 million compared to $8.2 million provided by financing activities for the same period last year. The net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to $26.7 million of proceeds from debt. These sources from financing activities were partially offset by $14.7 million of payments on the Company's long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, Landec incurred expenditures for facility expansions and purchased equipment to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Fresh vegetables and Lifecore businesses. These expenditures represented the majority of the $40.9 million of capital expenditures.\nDebt\nOn August 19, 2004, Lifecore issued variable rate industrial revenue bonds ( IRBs\u201d). These IRBs were assumed by Landec in the acquisition of Lifecore. The IRBs are collateralized by a bank letter of credit which is secured by a first mortgage on Lifecore's facility in Chaska, Minnesota. In addition, Lifecore pays an annual remarketing fee equal to 0.125% and an annual letter of credit fee of 0.75% on the outstanding principal balance.\nOn April 23, 2012 in connection with the acquisition of GreenLine Holding Company, Apio entered into three loan agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation and/or its affiliates ( GE Capital\u201d):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> A five-year, $25.0 million asset-based working capital revolving line of credit, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%, with availability based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances of Apio and its subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> A $12.7 million capital equipment loan which matures in seven years payable in monthly principal and interest payments of $175,356 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.39% per annum.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> 3)\n</td> <td> A $19.2 million real estate loan, $1.2 million of which was paid in April 2013, with the remaining principal balance due in ten years. The real estate loan has a fifteen year amortization period due in monthly principal and interest payments of $133,060 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.02% per annum. The principal balance remaining at the end of the ten year term is due in one lump sum on April 23, 2022.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 17, 2014, Apio entered into an amendment with GE Capital, which amended the revolving line of credit dated April 23, 2012 among the parties. Under the amendment, the revolving line of credit increased from $25 million to $40 million, the interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 1.75%, and the term was extended to July 17, 2019, among other changes. The availability under the revolving line of credit is based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (availability was $22.6 million at May 29, 2016). Apio's revolving line of credit has a fee of 0.375% per annum on the unused amount. At May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, there was $3.5 million and zero, respectively, outstanding under Apio's revolving line of credit.\nAlso on July 17, 2014, Apio entered into a new equipment loan with GE Capital whereby Apio could borrow up to $25 million based on eligible equipment purchases between August 1, 2012 and August 31, 2015. Each borrowing under this new equipment loan has a five year term with a seven year amortization period. On August 28, 2014, Apio borrowed $7.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.68%. On November 24, 2014, Apio borrowed an additional $4.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.74%. This loan was terminated upon entering into the commitment letter with GE Capital on May 15, 2015.\nOn May 15, 2015, GE Capital and Apio entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which GE Capital committed to lend Apio up to approximately $14.7 million in equipment financing and approximately $7.7 million in real property financing. The equipment loan and the real property loan will be made pursuant to existing loan agreements dated as of April 23, 2012, as amended May 17, 2013 and July 17, 2014. The equipment loan is available to finance purchases of equipment between May 1, 2015 and June 30, 2017. The real property loan will be used to finance the expansion of Apio's facility in Hanover, PA. On February 26, 2016, the Company borrowed $9.1 million under the equipment loan at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of five years and $7.7 million under the real property loan also at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of ten years.\nThe GE real property, equipment and line of credit agreements (collectively the GE Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Apio and its subsidiaries. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary events of default under which obligations could be accelerated or increased. The GE Capital real estate and equipment loans are guaranteed by Landec, and Landec has pledged its equity interest in Apio as collateral under the line of credit agreement. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Apio's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends, sell stock or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; or (7) make changes in Apio's corporate structure. In addition, Apio must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if the availability under its line of credit falls below $12.0 million. Apio was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\nAlso on May 15, 2015, Apio and Bank of America ( BofA\u201d) entered into a commitment letter and loan agreement, pursuant to which Apio will be permitted to borrow up to $15.0 million to finance equipment purchases made between October 1, 2014 and April 30, 2016 (the BofA Loan\u201d). Each borrowing under the BofA Loan will have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate based on the 2.5-year swap rate at the time of borrowing. Borrowings will be secured by equipment financed with proceeds of the BofA Loan. In addition, on May 15, 2015, Landec and BofA entered into a Guaranty, pursuant to which Landec guaranteed Apio's payment obligations under the BofA Loan. On May 29, 2015, Apio borrowed $3.8 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.79%. On November 27, 2015, Apio borrowed $4.2 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.92%.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, Apio capitalized $200,000 of loan origination fees from new equipment loans and/or amendments with GE Capital and BofA. Loan origination fees of $397,000 and zero were capitalized in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization of loan origination fees for Apio recorded to interest expense for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $293,000, $206,000 and $187,000, respectively. Unamortized loan origination fees were $1.1 million and $1.2 million at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn May 23, 2012, Lifecore entered into two financing agreements with BMO Harris Bank N.A. and/or its affiliates ( BMO Harris\u201d), collectively (the Lifecore Loan Agreements\u201d):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> A $12.0 million term loan which matures in four years due in monthly payments of $250,000 with interest payable monthly based on a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2% (the Term Loan\u201d).

As of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nThe obligations of Lifecore under the Lifecore Loan Agreements and Credit Agreement (collectively Lifecore Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Lifecore. The Lifecore Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Lifecore's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (7) adopt certain benefit plans; and (8) make changes in Lifecore's corporate structure. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, Lifecore must maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if Lifecore's unrestricted cash balance is less than 50% of total funded debt at the end of each fiscal quarter and (b) a net debt cash flow leverage ratio of less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. Lifecore was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015. Unamortized loan origination fees for the Lifecore Debt Agreements were zero and $48,000 at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe market value of the Company's debt approximates its recorded value as the interest rates on each debt instrument approximate current market rates.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of May 29, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due in Fiscal Year Ended May\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt principal payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,521 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest payment amounts above include (1) all of the GE Capital and BofA fixed rate loans (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of the Company's fixed rate loans), (2) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate loans with GE Capital entered into on February 26, 2016 based on the five year historical average 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% or 2.73% and (3) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate IRB based on the five year historical interest rate average for the Municipal Swap Index plus 20 basis points plus the letter of credit and remarketing fees of 0.875% resulting in an estimated rate of 1.18%.\nLandec is not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off-balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments.\nLandec's future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of its research and development programs; the continued development of marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; the ability of Landec to establish and maintain new licensing arrangements; any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities; weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce, the timing and amount, if any, of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; the ability to comply with regulatory requirements; the emergence of competitive technology and market forces; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; and other factors. If Landec's currently available funds, together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs, Landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners, additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities. There can be no assurance that additional funds, if required, will be available to Landec on favorable terms, if at all.\nLandec believes that its cash from operations, along with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those mentioned in this report and, in particular, the factors described in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\u201d Landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report.\nOverview\nLandec Corporation and its subsidiaries ( Landec\u201d or the Company\u201d) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated products for food and biomaterials markets and license technology applications to partners. The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: 1) Intelimer polymers, and 2) hyaluronan ( HA\u201d) biopolymers. The Company's HA biopolymers and non-HA materials are proprietary in that they are specially formulated for specific customers to meet strict regulatory requirements. The Company's polymer technologies, along with its customer relationships and trade names, are the foundation, and a key differentiating advantage upon which Landec has built its business. The Company sells specialty packaged branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut vegetables and whole produce to retailers, club stores and foodservice operators, primarily in the United States, Canada and Asia through its Apio, Inc. ( Apio\u201d) subsidiary and sells HA and non-HA based biomaterials through its Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. ( Lifecore\u201d) subsidiary.\nLandec has three operating segments - Packaged Fresh Vegetables, Food Export, and Biomaterials. The Packaged Fresh Vegetables segment combines the Company's BreatheWay packaging technology with Apio's branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut and whole produce business. The Food Export business is operated through Apio's Cal-Ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly Asian markets. The Biomaterials business sells products utilizing HA in the ophthalmic, orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies HA to customers pursuing other medical applications, such as aesthetic surgery, medical device coatings, tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals. In addition, Lifecore provides specialized aseptic fill and finish services in a cGMP validated manufacturing facility for supplying commercial, clinical and pre-clinical products. See \"Business - Description of Business Segments\".\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company's retained earnings were $73.5 million. The Company may incur losses in the future. The amount of future net profits, if any, is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain profitability in future years.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require management's most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition; sales returns and allowances; self-insurance liabilities; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets; the valuation of intangible assets and inventory; the valuation of investments; and the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation.\nThese estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments. The analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. The actual results may differ from management's estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value, provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. These provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve, based on historical losses, for inventory currently considered to be usable.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title has transferred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts, product returns, and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses.\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues generally consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole vegetable products that are generally washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of these products to customers. The Company takes title to all produce it sells and/or packages, and therefore, records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nIn addition, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners. Revenue is recognized on the vegetable cooling operations as cooling and storage services are provided to our customers. Sales of BreatheWay packaging are recognized when shipped to our customers.\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. As most Cal-Ex customers are in countries outside of the U.S., title transfers and revenue is generally recognized upon arrival of the shipment in the foreign port. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nOur Biomaterials business principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA and non-HA materials. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016. The vast majority of revenues from our Biomaterials business are recognized upon shipment.\nLifecore's business development revenues, a portion of which are included in all three medical areas, are related to contract research and development (R&D) services and multiple element arrangement services with customers where the Company provides products and/or services in a bundled arrangement.\nContract R&D revenue is recorded as earned, based on the performance requirements of the contract. Non-refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and there is no continuing involvement by the Company, are recognized on the earlier of when the payment is received or collection is assured.\nFor sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, the Company splits the arrangement into separate units of accounting if the individually delivered elements have value to the customer on a standalone basis. The Company also evaluates whether multiple transactions with the same customer or related party should be considered part of a multiple element arrangement, whereby the Company assesses, among other factors, whether the contracts or agreements are negotiated or executed within a short time frame of each other or if there are indicators that the contracts are negotiated in contemplation of each other. The Company then allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The relative selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), if available, third-party evidence (TPE), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. The Company is not typically able to determine VSOE or TPE, and therefore, uses the estimated selling price to allocate revenue between the elements of an arrangement.\nThe Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or future performance obligations or subject to customer-specific cancellation rights. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value, and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by the Company. The Company considers a deliverable to have stand-alone value if the product or service is sold separately by the Company or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, the revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. The Company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price. In instances where the Company has not established fair value for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of the final element is completed and all recognition criteria are met.\nLicensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance. Initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Noncancellable, nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement, including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non-substantive at the outset of the arrangement.\nFrom time to time, the Company offers customers sales incentives, which include volume rebates and discounts. These amounts are estimated on a quarterly basis and recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nA summary of revenues by type of revenue arrangement as described above is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded upon shipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>458,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>398,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded upon acceptance in foreign port\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from multiple element arrangements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,811 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from license fees, R&D contracts and royalties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve to thirteen years and trademarks/trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives (collectively, intangible assets\u201d), which the Company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance (i) upon the acquisition of GreenLine by Apio in April 2012, (ii) upon the acquisition of Lifecore in April 2010 and (iii) upon the acquisition of Apio in December 1999. Accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition.\u201d All intangible assets, including goodwill, associated with the acquisition of Lifecore was allocated to our Biomaterials reporting unit and the acquisitions of Apio and GreenLine were allocated to our Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit. As of May 29, 2016, the Biomaterials reporting unit had $13.9 million of goodwill and the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit had $35.7 million of goodwill.\nThe Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in accordance with accounting guidance. For all indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, the Company performs a qualitative analysis in accordance with ASC 350-30-35. Application of the impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment by management, including identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and assignment of intangible assets to reporting units, which judgments are inherently uncertain.\nDuring the three months ended February 28, 2016, management made the strategic decision to convert its GreenLine branded products in retail grocery stores to the Eat Smart brand. This decision resulted in an impairment of the GreenLine tradename. Management estimated the value of the remaining GreenLine branded foodservice sales using the relief from royalty valuation method, which resulted in an impairment of $34.0 million. The remaining GreenLine tradename associated with the Company's foodservice business is valued at $2.0 million. The impairment charge is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income under Impairment of GreenLine Tradename\u201d as an operating expense under the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit.\nThe Company tested its remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of these assets were necessary as of that date. As a result, it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test at the time. Subsequent to the 2016 annual impairment test, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill. As of May 29, 2016, there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable or that goodwill should be tested for impairment. Therefore, there was no impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. There were no impairment losses for goodwill during fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on management's assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation. Such changes, if significant or material, could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets during the current period. The results of these tests could lead to write-downs of the carrying values of these assets in the current period.\nIn the annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, management considers the impact of these key factors: macro-economic conditions, industry and market environment, overall financial performance of the Company, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If management determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nIf a quantitative test is required, the Company compares the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to its carrying value including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value using both an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the Company and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Under the market-based approach, information regarding the Company is utilized as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples that are used to value each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company's income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. At May 29, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million against deferred tax assets.\nIn addition to valuation allowances, the Company establishes tax-contingency accruals for uncertain tax positions. The tax-contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax-contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management.\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has accrued, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes its tax-contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. The Company's tax-contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company's stock-based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs).\nThe estimated fair value for stock options, which determines the Company's calculation of compensation expense, is based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. In addition, the accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the time of grant. As a result, the Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items measured at fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non-public company (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities.\nThe accounting guidance established a three-tier hierarchy for fair value measurements, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of May 29, 2016, the only asset of the Company that was measured at fair value on a recurring basis was its minority interest investment in Windset.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in Windset. The calculation of fair value utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models, including projected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. As a result, the Company's investment in Windset is considered to be a Level 3 measurement investment. The change in the fair market value of the Company's investment in Windset for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was due to the Company's 26.9% minority interest in the change in the fair market value of Windset during those periods. In determining the fair value of the investment in Windset, the Company utilizes the following significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At May 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At May 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual consolidated revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Annual consolidated expense growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated income tax rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> <td>to </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe revenue growth, expense growth and income tax rate assumptions, consider the Company's best estimate of the trends in those items over the discount period. The discount rate assumption takes into account the risk-free rate of return, the market equity risk premium and the company's specific risk premium and then applies an additional discount for lack of marketability of the underlying securities. The discounted cash flow valuation model used by the Company has the following sensitivity to changes in inputs and assumptions (in thousands):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact on value of Windset investment as of May 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in revenue growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in expense growth rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(600 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in income tax rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% increase in discount rates\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of the Company's Windset investment as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was $62.7 million and $61.5 million, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements intended to provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a company's contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2019 with early application permitted in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2018. The standard allows for either full retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect that adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be presented on the consolidated balance sheets as noncurrent. Deferred taxes were previously required to be classified as current or non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective February 28, 2016 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of the Company's net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax liability in its consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2016. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use-assets. ASU 2016-02 also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),\u201d which changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended May 29, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015\nRevenues (in thousands):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>488,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>541,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe decrease in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period of last year was primarily due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales. The volume decrease was due to lower sales in Apio's historical core packaged fresh vegetable business due to a severe shortage of produce during most of the second and third fiscal quarters of 2016, partially offset by increased sales of higher-priced salad kit products. The decrease was also due to fiscal year 2015 having an extra week compared to fiscal year 2016 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 was due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales as a result of produce shortages and the high value of the U.S. dollar compared to most Asian currencies which made our export products more expensive for our foreign customers who pay Apio in U.S. dollars.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016.\nThe increase in Lifecore's revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase of $9.7 million in development service revenues from existing customers, and an increase of $4.6 million in fermentation revenues due primarily to a customer that reduced its purchases last year due to an inventory adjustment resuming their historical purchase levels in fiscal year 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in aseptic revenues of $4.2 million for fiscal year 2016 as a result of lower customer demand primarily due to inventory management initiative put in place by several customers.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These costs include the following: raw materials (including produce, seeds, packaging, syringes and fermentation and purification supplies), direct labor, overhead (including indirect labor, depreciation, and facility related costs) and shipping and shipping-related costs. The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to severe produce shortages resulting from unseasonably warm weather in California throughout most of the second and third quarters of this fiscal year which significantly reduced yields. The excess cost from produce shortages for fiscal year 2016 of approximately $15.6 million more than offset the gross profit generated from a favorable product mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales being generated from the higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin historical core fresh packaged vegetable business.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Food Export business during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to lower revenues partially offset by a favorable product mix. The gross profit as a percent of sales during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 was 6.5% compared to a gross margin of 6.3% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to a 25% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a higher percentage of revenues coming from the higher margin development service revenues and fermentation products than from the lower margin aseptically filled products.\nCorporate\nThe increase in Corporate gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, General and Administrative:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total S,G&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. R&D efforts at Apio are focused on the Company's proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. In the Lifecore business, the R&D efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA-based and non-HA biomaterials. For Corporate, the R&D efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses and on new R&D collaborations with partners.\nThe increase in R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in R&D at Apio and Corporate due primarily to supporting development partners for the Company's BreatheWay membrane technology.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to (1) a 21% increase in S,G&A at Apio primarily to ramp up introduction, product launches, advertising and promotions of our existing and new salad kit products and from additional headcount hired over the past year, (2) a 31% increase at Lifecore primarily due to bonuses being accrued this fiscal year compared to a nominal amount last fiscal year and from headcount additions to support its growth and (3) a 29% increase at Corporate primarily due to the reversal of the $677,000 LTIP accrual last fiscal year and from an increase in stock based compensation as a result of stock option and RSU grants made in May 2015, with the predominate amount of those grants being granted to the new CEO.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 29, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,987 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> N/M\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(193 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(181 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe decrease in interest income in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2016 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 is due to the tax benefit from the GreenLine impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and from a decrease in net income before taxes, excluding the GreenLine impairment charge, compared to last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP.\nThe decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nFiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 25, 2014\nRevenues (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>360,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>539,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe increase in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 12% increase in unit volume sales resulting primarily from new salad kit products which typically have a higher price per unit than historical offerings. In addition, fiscal year 2015 included an extra week compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 was due to a 9% decrease in unit volume sales primarily as a result of a west coast longshoreman's labor dispute which was partially offset by a favorable product mix to higher priced export products.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 60% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015 and (3) Veterinary/Other.\nThe decrease in Lifecore's revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a 29% decrease in revenues in Lifecore's fermentation business for Ophthalmic products as a result of lower shipments to a major customer as it aligns its inventory levels with newly stated corporate guidelines and a 25% decrease in business development revenues due to the delay in the timing of certain development activities. These decreases were partially offset by increased aseptic filling revenues.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period of last year was not significant.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Packaged Fresh Vegetables\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Export\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Biomaterials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These costs include the following: raw materials (including produce, seeds, packaging, syringes and fermentation and purification supplies), direct labor, overhead (including indirect labor, depreciation, and facility related costs) and shipping and shipping-related costs. The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe increase in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the 19% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin core packaged vegetable products. In addition, during fiscal year 2014, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business experienced higher than expected raw produce sourcing costs due to a variety of factors, most importantly the heavy rains in the Midwest and along the East Coast and cooler than normal temperatures in California.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's export business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to a 3% decrease in revenues and from higher costs to source the higher priced export produce resulting in a lower gross profit as a percent of sales. The gross margin during fiscal year 2015 was 6.3% compared to a gross margin of 7.6% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe decrease in gross profit during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the 12% decrease in revenues and from an unfavorable product mix change to a higher percentage of sales being from the lower margin aseptically filled products compared to the higher margin fermentation products and business development revenues in the prior year.\nCorporate\nThe decrease in Corporate gross profit for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total R&D\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, General and Administrative:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Apio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lifecore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total S,G&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. Research and development efforts at Apio are focused on the Company's proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. In the Lifecore business, the research and development efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA and non-HA based biomaterials. For Corporate, the research and development efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses.\nThe decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in Apio R&D as products move from the development stage to commercialization offset by slight increases in R&D at Lifecore and Corporate.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 20% increase in sales and marketing expenses at Apio primarily to promote our new salad kit products and from the addition of incremental headcount to assist in developing and promoting future products.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nFiscal Year ended\nMay 25, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,650 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,583 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-controlling Interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(181 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(197 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to an $8.1 million net increase in long-term debt during fiscal year 2015.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2015 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In addition, other income during fiscal year 2015 included a $793,000 expense for the write off of the Company's investment in Aesthetic Sciences, Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a 28% decrease in net income before taxes compared to the same period last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP. The decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million, a net decrease of $4.2 million from $14.1 million at May 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nLandec generated $21.8 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 compared to generating $26.2 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2015. The primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 were from (1) $10.1 million of net income, excluding the non-cash impairment charge for the GreenLine trademark of $34.0 million and the tax benefit of $12.5 million from the GreenLine impairment charge, (2) $12.9 million of depreciation/amortization and stock based compensation expenses, and (3) a $2.7 million net increase in deferred tax liabilities, after excluding the tax benefit adjustment from the GreenLine impairment charge, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in the investment in Windset and a net increase of $2.5 million in working capital.\nThe primary factors which increased working capital during fiscal year 2016 were (1) a $4.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to a $5.7 million decrease at Apio due to the timing of payments and (2) a $1.3 million decrease in accrued compensation as a result of fiscal year 2015 bonuses being paid in fiscal year 2016 and no bonuses being accrued in fiscal year 2016 for Apio and Corporate executive management. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities due to an increase in operating expenses and inventory reserves for unusable film and packaging as a result of lost customer business.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $41.6 million compared to $34.4 million for the same period last year. The primary uses of cash in investing activities during fiscal year 2016 were for $40.9 million of expenditures for facility expansions and the purchase of equipment primarily to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Vegetables and Lifecore businesses. Included in the use of cash from investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was an additional $18.0 million investment in Windset.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $15.6 million compared to $8.2 million provided by financing activities for the same period last year. The net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to $26.7 million of proceeds from debt. These sources from financing activities were partially offset by $14.7 million of payments on the Company's long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, Landec incurred expenditures for facility expansions and purchased equipment to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Fresh vegetables and Lifecore businesses. These expenditures represented the majority of the $40.9 million of capital expenditures.\nDebt\nOn August 19, 2004, Lifecore issued variable rate industrial revenue bonds ( IRBs\u201d). These IRBs were assumed by Landec in the acquisition of Lifecore. The IRBs are collateralized by a bank letter of credit which is secured by a first mortgage on Lifecore's facility in Chaska, Minnesota. In addition, Lifecore pays an annual remarketing fee equal to 0.125% and an annual letter of credit fee of 0.75% on the outstanding principal balance.\nOn April 23, 2012 in connection with the acquisition of GreenLine Holding Company, Apio entered into three loan agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation and/or its affiliates ( GE Capital\u201d):\n 1) A five-year, $25.0 million asset-based working capital revolving line of credit, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%, with availability based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances of Apio and its subsidiaries. \n 2) A $12.7 million capital equipment loan which matures in seven years payable in monthly principal and interest payments of $175,356 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.39% per annum. \n 3) A $19.2 million real estate loan, $1.2 million of which was paid in April 2013, with the remaining principal balance due in ten years. The real estate loan has a fifteen year amortization period due in monthly principal and interest payments of $133,060 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.02% per annum. The principal balance remaining at the end of the ten year term is due in one lump sum on April 23, 2022. \nOn July 17, 2014, Apio entered into an amendment with GE Capital, which amended the revolving line of credit dated April 23, 2012 among the parties. Under the amendment, the revolving line of credit increased from $25 million to $40 million, the interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 1.75%, and the term was extended to July 17, 2019, among other changes. The availability under the revolving line of credit is based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (availability was $22.6 million at May 29, 2016). Apio's revolving line of credit has a fee of 0.375% per annum on the unused amount. At May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, there was $3.5 million and zero, respectively, outstanding under Apio's revolving line of credit.\nAlso on July 17, 2014, Apio entered into a new equipment loan with GE Capital whereby Apio could borrow up to $25 million based on eligible equipment purchases between August 1, 2012 and August 31, 2015. Each borrowing under this new equipment loan has a five year term with a seven year amortization period. On August 28, 2014, Apio borrowed $7.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.68%. On November 24, 2014, Apio borrowed an additional $4.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.74%. This loan was terminated upon entering into the commitment letter with GE Capital on May 15, 2015.\nOn May 15, 2015, GE Capital and Apio entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which GE Capital committed to lend Apio up to approximately $14.7 million in equipment financing and approximately $7.7 million in real property financing. The equipment loan and the real property loan will be made pursuant to existing loan agreements dated as of April 23, 2012, as amended May 17, 2013 and July 17, 2014. The equipment loan is available to finance purchases of equipment between May 1, 2015 and June 30, 2017. The real property loan will be used to finance the expansion of Apio's facility in Hanover, PA. On February 26, 2016, the Company borrowed $9.1 million under the equipment loan at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of five years and $7.7 million under the real property loan also at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of ten years.\nThe GE real property, equipment and line of credit agreements (collectively the GE Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Apio and its subsidiaries. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary events of default under which obligations could be accelerated or increased. The GE Capital real estate and equipment loans are guaranteed by Landec, and Landec has pledged its equity interest in Apio as collateral under the line of credit agreement. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Apio's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends, sell stock or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; or (7) make changes in Apio's corporate structure. In addition, Apio must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if the availability under its line of credit falls below $12.0 million. Apio was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\nAlso on May 15, 2015, Apio and Bank of America ( BofA\u201d) entered into a commitment letter and loan agreement, pursuant to which Apio will be permitted to borrow up to $15.0 million to finance equipment purchases made between October 1, 2014 and April 30, 2016 (the BofA Loan\u201d). Each borrowing under the BofA Loan will have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate based on the 2.5-year swap rate at the time of borrowing. Borrowings will be secured by equipment financed with proceeds of the BofA Loan. In addition, on May 15, 2015, Landec and BofA entered into a Guaranty, pursuant to which Landec guaranteed Apio's payment obligations under the BofA Loan. On May 29, 2015, Apio borrowed $3.8 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.79%. On November 27, 2015, Apio borrowed $4.2 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.92%.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, Apio capitalized $200,000 of loan origination fees from new equipment loans and/or amendments with GE Capital and BofA. Loan origination fees of $397,000 and zero were capitalized in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization of loan origination fees for Apio recorded to interest expense for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $293,000, $206,000 and $187,000, respectively. Unamortized loan origination fees were $1.1 million and $1.2 million at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn May 23, 2012, Lifecore entered into two financing agreements with BMO Harris Bank N.A. and/or its affiliates ( BMO Harris\u201d), collectively (the Lifecore Loan Agreements\u201d):\n (1) A $12.0 million term loan which matures in four years due in monthly payments of $250,000 with interest payable monthly based on a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2% (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan was paid off on May 2, 2016. \n (2) A Reimbursement Agreement pursuant to which BMO Harris caused its affiliate Bank of Montreal to issue an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $3.5 million (the Letter of Credit\u201d) which is securing the IRBs described above. \nOn May 22, 2015, Lifecore entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with BMO Harris which includes a two-year, $10.0 million asset-based working capital revolving line of credit, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.85%, with availability based on the combination of Lifecore's eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances (availability was $9.6 million at May 29, 2016) and with no unused fee. As of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nThe obligations of Lifecore under the Lifecore Loan Agreements and Credit Agreement (collectively Lifecore Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Lifecore. The Lifecore Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Lifecore's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (7) adopt certain benefit plans; and (8) make changes in Lifecore's corporate structure. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, Lifecore must maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if Lifecore's unrestricted cash balance is less than 50% of total funded debt at the end of each fiscal quarter and (b) a net debt cash flow leverage ratio of less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. Lifecore was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015. Unamortized loan origination fees for the Lifecore Debt Agreements were zero and $48,000 at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe market value of the Company's debt approximates its recorded value as the interest rates on each debt instrument approximate current market rates.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of May 29, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Due in Fiscal Year Ended May\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nObligation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt principal payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,521 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest payment amounts above include (1) all of the GE Capital and BofA fixed rate loans (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of the Company's fixed rate loans), (2) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate loans with GE Capital entered into on February 26, 2016 based on the five year historical average 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% or 2.73% and (3) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate IRB based on the five year historical interest rate average for the Municipal Swap Index plus 20 basis points plus the letter of credit and remarketing fees of 0.875% resulting in an estimated rate of 1.18%.\nLandec is not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off-balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments.\nLandec's future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of its research and development programs; the continued development of marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; the ability of Landec to establish and maintain new licensing arrangements; any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities; weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce, the timing and amount, if any, of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; the ability to comply with regulatory requirements; the emergence of competitive technology and market forces; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; and other factors. If Landec's currently available funds, together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs, Landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners, additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities. There can be no assurance that additional funds, if required, will be available to Landec on favorable terms, if at all.\nLandec believes that its cash from operations, along with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, those mentioned in this report and, in particular, the factors described in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\u201d Landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report.\nOverview\nLandec Corporation and its subsidiaries ( Landec\u201d or the Company\u201d) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated products for food and biomaterials markets and license technology applications to partners. The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: 1) Intelimer polymers, and 2) hyaluronan ( HA\u201d) biopolymers. The Company's HA biopolymers and non-HA materials are proprietary in that they are specially formulated for specific customers to meet strict regulatory requirements. The Company's polymer technologies, along with its customer relationships and trade names, are the foundation, and a key differentiating advantage upon which Landec has built its business. The Company sells specialty packaged branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut vegetables and whole produce to retailers, club stores and foodservice operators, primarily in the United States, Canada and Asia through its Apio, Inc. ( Apio\u201d) subsidiary and sells HA and non-HA based biomaterials through its Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. ( Lifecore\u201d) subsidiary.\nLandec has three operating segments - Packaged Fresh Vegetables, Food Export, and Biomaterials. The Packaged Fresh Vegetables segment combines the Company's BreatheWay packaging technology with Apio's branded Eat Smart and GreenLine and private label fresh-cut and whole produce business. The Food Export business is operated through Apio's Cal-Ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly Asian markets. The Biomaterials business sells products utilizing HA in the ophthalmic, orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies HA to customers pursuing other medical applications, such as aesthetic surgery, medical device coatings, tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals. In addition, Lifecore provides specialized aseptic fill and finish services in a cGMP validated manufacturing facility for supplying commercial, clinical and pre-clinical products. See \"Business - Description of Business Segments\".\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company's retained earnings were $73.5 million. The Company may incur losses in the future. The amount of future net profits, if any, is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain profitability in future years.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting estimates that require management's most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition; sales returns and allowances; self-insurance liabilities; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets; the valuation of intangible assets and inventory; the valuation of investments; and the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation.\nThese estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments. The analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. The actual results may differ from management's estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value, provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. These provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve, based on historical losses, for inventory currently considered to be usable.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, title has transferred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts, product returns, and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses.\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues generally consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole vegetable products that are generally washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of these products to customers. The Company takes title to all produce it sells and/or packages, and therefore, records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\nIn addition, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners. Revenue is recognized on the vegetable cooling operations as cooling and storage services are provided to our customers. Sales of BreatheWay packaging are recognized when shipped to our customers.\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. As most Cal-Ex customers are in countries outside of the U.S., title transfers and revenue is generally recognized upon arrival of the shipment in the foreign port. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nOur Biomaterials business principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA and non-HA materials. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016. The vast majority of revenues from our Biomaterials business are recognized upon shipment.\nLifecore's business development revenues, a portion of which are included in all three medical areas, are related to contract research and development (R&D) services and multiple element arrangement services with customers where the Company provides products and/or services in a bundled arrangement.\nContract R&D revenue is recorded as earned, based on the performance requirements of the contract. Non-refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist, and there is no continuing involvement by the Company, are recognized on the earlier of when the payment is received or collection is assured.\nFor sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, the Company splits the arrangement into separate units of accounting if the individually delivered elements have value to the customer on a standalone basis. The Company also evaluates whether multiple transactions with the same customer or related party should be considered part of a multiple element arrangement, whereby the Company assesses, among other factors, whether the contracts or agreements are negotiated or executed within a short time frame of each other or if there are indicators that the contracts are negotiated in contemplation of each other. The Company then allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The relative selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE), if available, third-party evidence (TPE), if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. The Company is not typically able to determine VSOE or TPE, and therefore, uses the estimated selling price to allocate revenue between the elements of an arrangement.\nThe Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or future performance obligations or subject to customer-specific cancellation rights. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value, and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services, delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by the Company. The Company considers a deliverable to have stand-alone value if the product or service is sold separately by the Company or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. Further, the revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products. Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element(s) and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition. The Company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price. In instances where the Company has not established fair value for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of the final element is completed and all recognition criteria are met.\nLicensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance. Initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Noncancellable, nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement, including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non-substantive at the outset of the arrangement.\nFrom time to time, the Company offers customers sales incentives, which include volume rebates and discounts. These amounts are estimated on a quarterly basis and recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nA summary of revenues by type of revenue arrangement as described above is as follows (in thousands):\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve to thirteen years and trademarks/trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives (collectively, intangible assets\u201d), which the Company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance (i) upon the acquisition of GreenLine by Apio in April 2012, (ii) upon the acquisition of Lifecore in April 2010 and (iii) upon the acquisition of Apio in December 1999. Accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition.\u201d All intangible assets, including goodwill, associated with the acquisition of Lifecore was allocated to our Biomaterials reporting unit and the acquisitions of Apio and GreenLine were allocated to our Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit. As of May 29, 2016, the Biomaterials reporting unit had $13.9 million of goodwill and the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit had $35.7 million of goodwill.\nThe Company tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in accordance with accounting guidance. For all indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, the Company performs a qualitative analysis in accordance with ASC 350-30-35. Application of the impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment by management, including identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and assignment of intangible assets to reporting units, which judgments are inherently uncertain.\nDuring the three months ended February 28, 2016, management made the strategic decision to convert its GreenLine branded products in retail grocery stores to the Eat Smart brand. This decision resulted in an impairment of the GreenLine tradename. Management estimated the value of the remaining GreenLine branded foodservice sales using the relief from royalty valuation method, which resulted in an impairment of $34.0 million. The remaining GreenLine tradename associated with the Company's foodservice business is valued at $2.0 million. The impairment charge is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income under Impairment of GreenLine Tradename\u201d as an operating expense under the Packaged Fresh Vegetables reporting unit.\nThe Company tested its remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment as of February 29, 2016 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of these assets were necessary as of that date. As a result, it was not necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test at the time. Subsequent to the 2016 annual impairment test, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill. As of May 29, 2016, there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable or that goodwill should be tested for impairment. Therefore, there was no impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. There were no impairment losses for goodwill during fiscal years 2015 and 2014.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on management's assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation. Such changes, if significant or material, could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets during the current period. The results of these tests could lead to write-downs of the carrying values of these assets in the current period.\nIn the annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, management considers the impact of these key factors: macro-economic conditions, industry and market environment, overall financial performance of the Company, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If management determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nIf a quantitative test is required, the Company compares the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets to its carrying value including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value using both an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the Company and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Under the market-based approach, information regarding the Company is utilized as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples that are used to value each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company will determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company's income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. At May 29, 2016, the Company had a valuation allowance of $1.2 million against deferred tax assets.\nIn addition to valuation allowances, the Company establishes tax-contingency accruals for uncertain tax positions. The tax-contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company's effective tax rate includes the impact of tax-contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management.\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has accrued, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes its tax-contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. The Company's tax-contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company's stock-based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs).\nThe estimated fair value for stock options, which determines the Company's calculation of compensation expense, is based on the Black-Scholes pricing model. In addition, the accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the time of grant. As a result, the Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items measured at fair value. The Company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non-public company (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities.\nThe accounting guidance established a three-tier hierarchy for fair value measurements, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\nLevel 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of May 29, 2016, the only asset of the Company that was measured at fair value on a recurring basis was its minority interest investment in Windset.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in Windset. The calculation of fair value utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models, including projected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. As a result, the Company's investment in Windset is considered to be a Level 3 measurement investment. The change in the fair market value of the Company's investment in Windset for the fiscal years ended May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was due to the Company's 26.9% minority interest in the change in the fair market value of Windset during those periods. In determining the fair value of the investment in Windset, the Company utilizes the following significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models:\n\nThe revenue growth, expense growth and income tax rate assumptions, consider the Company's best estimate of the trends in those items over the discount period. The discount rate assumption takes into account the risk-free rate of return, the market equity risk premium and the company's specific risk premium and then applies an additional discount for lack of marketability of the underlying securities. The discounted cash flow valuation model used by the Company has the following sensitivity to changes in inputs and assumptions (in thousands):\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of the Company's Windset investment as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015 was $62.7 million and $61.5 million, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements intended to provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a company's contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2019 with early application permitted in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 2018. The standard allows for either full retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective\u201d adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. Management does not expect that adoption of ASU 2015-03 will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nBalance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be presented on the consolidated balance sheets as noncurrent. Deferred taxes were previously required to be classified as current or non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective February 28, 2016 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU resulted in a reclassification of the Company's net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax liability in its consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2016. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use-assets. ASU 2016-02 also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),\u201d which changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-09 will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended May 29, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015\nRevenues (in thousands):\n\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe decrease in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period of last year was primarily due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales. The volume decrease was due to lower sales in Apio's historical core packaged fresh vegetable business due to a severe shortage of produce during most of the second and third fiscal quarters of 2016, partially offset by increased sales of higher-priced salad kit products. The decrease was also due to fiscal year 2015 having an extra week compared to fiscal year 2016 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 was due to a 5% decrease in unit volume sales as a result of produce shortages and the high value of the U.S. dollar compared to most Asian currencies which made our export products more expensive for our foreign customers who pay Apio in U.S. dollars.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 55% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016 and (3) Other/Non-HA products which represented approximately 25% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2016.\nThe increase in Lifecore's revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase of $9.7 million in development service revenues from existing customers, and an increase of $4.6 million in fermentation revenues due primarily to a customer that reduced its purchases last year due to an inventory adjustment resuming their historical purchase levels in fiscal year 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in aseptic revenues of $4.2 million for fiscal year 2016 as a result of lower customer demand primarily due to inventory management initiative put in place by several customers.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\n\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These costs include the following: raw materials (including produce, seeds, packaging, syringes and fermentation and purification supplies), direct labor, overhead (including indirect labor, depreciation, and facility related costs) and shipping and shipping-related costs. The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to severe produce shortages resulting from unseasonably warm weather in California throughout most of the second and third quarters of this fiscal year which significantly reduced yields. The excess cost from produce shortages for fiscal year 2016 of approximately $15.6 million more than offset the gross profit generated from a favorable product mix resulting from a higher percentage of sales being generated from the higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin historical core fresh packaged vegetable business.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's Food Export business during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to lower revenues partially offset by a favorable product mix. The gross profit as a percent of sales during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 was 6.5% compared to a gross margin of 6.3% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe increase in gross profit during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to a 25% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a higher percentage of revenues coming from the higher margin development service revenues and fermentation products than from the lower margin aseptically filled products.\nCorporate\nThe increase in Corporate gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to two new licensing and R&D agreements entered into on June 1, 2015.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. R&D efforts at Apio are focused on the Company's proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. In the Lifecore business, the R&D efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA-based and non-HA biomaterials. For Corporate, the R&D efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses and on new R&D collaborations with partners.\nThe increase in R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in R&D at Apio and Corporate due primarily to supporting development partners for the Company's BreatheWay membrane technology.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to (1) a 21% increase in S,G&A at Apio primarily to ramp up introduction, product launches, advertising and promotions of our existing and new salad kit products and from additional headcount hired over the past year, (2) a 31% increase at Lifecore primarily due to bonuses being accrued this fiscal year compared to a nominal amount last fiscal year and from headcount additions to support its growth and (3) a 29% increase at Corporate primarily due to the reversal of the $677,000 LTIP accrual last fiscal year and from an increase in stock based compensation as a result of stock option and RSU grants made in May 2015, with the predominate amount of those grants being granted to the new CEO.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\n\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe decrease in interest income in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was not significant.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2016 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016 is due to the tax benefit from the GreenLine impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and from a decrease in net income before taxes, excluding the GreenLine impairment charge, compared to last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP.\nThe decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2016 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nFiscal Year Ended May 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 25, 2014\nRevenues (in thousands):\n\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nApio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh-cut and whole processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under Apio's Eat Smart and GreenLine brands and various private labels. In addition, Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues include the revenues generated from Apio Cooling, LP, a vegetable cooling operation in which Apio is the general partner with a 60% ownership position and from the sale of BreatheWay packaging to license partners.\nThe increase in Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables revenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 12% increase in unit volume sales resulting primarily from new salad kit products which typically have a higher price per unit than historical offerings. In addition, fiscal year 2015 included an extra week compared to fiscal year 2014 as a result of the timing of the Company's 2015 fiscal year end.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to Asia by Cal-Ex. Apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit.\nThe decrease in revenues in Apio's Food Export business for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 was due to a 9% decrease in unit volume sales primarily as a result of a west coast longshoreman's labor dispute which was partially offset by a favorable product mix to higher priced export products.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing HA. Lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas: (1) Ophthalmic, which represented approximately 60% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015, (2) Orthopedic, which represented approximately 20% of Lifecore's revenues in fiscal year 2015 and (3) Veterinary/Other.\nThe decrease in Lifecore's revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a 29% decrease in revenues in Lifecore's fermentation business for Ophthalmic products as a result of lower shipments to a major customer as it aligns its inventory levels with newly stated corporate guidelines and a 25% decrease in business development revenues due to the delay in the timing of certain development activities. These decreases were partially offset by increased aseptic filling revenues.\nCorporate\nCorporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with corporate partners.\nThe increase in Corporate revenues for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period of last year was not significant.\nGross Profit (in thousands):\n\nGeneral\nThere are numerous factors that can influence gross profit including product mix, customer mix, manufacturing costs, volume, sale discounts and charges for excess or obsolete inventory, to name a few. Many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors. The Company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above.\nPackaged Fresh Vegetables (Apio)\nThe increase in gross profit for Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the 19% increase in revenues and from a favorable product mix change to a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher margin salad kit products versus the lower margin core packaged vegetable products. In addition, during fiscal year 2014, Apio's Packaged Fresh Vegetables business experienced higher than expected raw produce sourcing costs due to a variety of factors, most importantly the heavy rains in the Midwest and along the East Coast and cooler than normal temperatures in California.\nFood Export (Apio)\nApio's Food Export business is a buy/sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the 5-10% range.\nThe decrease in gross profit for Apio's export business for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to a 3% decrease in revenues and from higher costs to source the higher priced export produce resulting in a lower gross profit as a percent of sales. The gross margin during fiscal year 2015 was 6.3% compared to a gross margin of 7.6% during the same period last year.\nBiomaterials (Lifecore)\nLifecore operates in the medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin percentage of approximately 35-50%.\nThe decrease in gross profit during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the 12% decrease in revenues and from an unfavorable product mix change to a higher percentage of sales being from the lower margin aseptically filled products compared to the higher margin fermentation products and business development revenues in the prior year.\nCorporate\nThe decrease in Corporate gross profit for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nOperating Expenses (in thousands):\n\nResearch and Development (R&D)\nLandec's R&D consisted primarily of product development and commercialization initiatives. Research and development efforts at Apio are focused on the Company's proprietary BreatheWay membranes used for packaging produce, with a focus on extending the shelf-life of sensitive vegetables and fruit. In the Lifecore business, the research and development efforts are focused on new products and applications for HA and non-HA based biomaterials. For Corporate, the research and development efforts are primarily focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and HA businesses.\nThe decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in Apio R&D as products move from the development stage to commercialization offset by slight increases in R&D at Lifecore and Corporate.\nSelling, General and Administrative (S,G&A)\nS,G&A expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with Landec's product sales and services, business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in S,G&A expenses for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a 20% increase in sales and marketing expenses at Apio primarily to promote our new salad kit products and from the addition of incremental headcount to assist in developing and promoting future products.\nNon-operating income/(expense) (in thousands):\n\nDividend Income\nDividend income is derived from the dividends accrued on our $22.0 million preferred stock investment in Windset which yields a cash dividend of 7.5% annually. The increase in dividend income for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to the Company increasing its preferred stock investment in Windset by $7.0 million on October 29, 2014.\nInterest Income\nThe increase in interest income in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was not significant.\nInterest Expense\nThe increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was due to an $8.1 million net increase in long-term debt during fiscal year 2015.\nOther Income\nThe decrease in other income for fiscal year 2015 was due to the change in the increase in the fair value of our Windset investment being lower in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. In addition, other income during fiscal year 2015 included a $793,000 expense for the write off of the Company's investment in Aesthetic Sciences, Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the income tax expense for fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a 28% decrease in net income before taxes compared to the same period last year.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe non-controlling interest consists of the limited partners' equity interest in the net income of Apio Cooling, LP. The decrease in non-controlling interest for fiscal year 2015 compared to the same period last year was not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 29, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million, a net decrease of $4.2 million from $14.1 million at May 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nLandec generated $21.8 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 compared to generating $26.2 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2015. The primary sources of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016 were from (1) $10.1 million of net income, excluding the non-cash impairment charge for the GreenLine trademark of $34.0 million and the tax benefit of $12.5 million from the GreenLine impairment charge, (2) $12.9 million of depreciation/amortization and stock based compensation expenses, and (3) a $2.7 million net increase in deferred tax liabilities, after excluding the tax benefit adjustment from the GreenLine impairment charge, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in the investment in Windset and a net increase of $2.5 million in working capital.\nThe primary factors which increased working capital during fiscal year 2016 were (1) a $4.1 million decrease in accounts payable due to a $5.7 million decrease at Apio due to the timing of payments and (2) a $1.3 million decrease in accrued compensation as a result of fiscal year 2015 bonuses being paid in fiscal year 2016 and no bonuses being accrued in fiscal year 2016 for Apio and Corporate executive management. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities due to an increase in operating expenses and inventory reserves for unusable film and packaging as a result of lost customer business.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $41.6 million compared to $34.4 million for the same period last year. The primary uses of cash in investing activities during fiscal year 2016 were for $40.9 million of expenditures for facility expansions and the purchase of equipment primarily to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Vegetables and Lifecore businesses. Included in the use of cash from investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was an additional $18.0 million investment in Windset.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2016 was $15.6 million compared to $8.2 million provided by financing activities for the same period last year. The net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to $26.7 million of proceeds from debt. These sources from financing activities were partially offset by $14.7 million of payments on the Company's long-term debt.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the fiscal year ended May 29, 2016, Landec incurred expenditures for facility expansions and purchased equipment to support the growth of the Apio Fresh Packaged Fresh vegetables and Lifecore businesses. These expenditures represented the majority of the $40.9 million of capital expenditures.\nDebt\nOn August 19, 2004, Lifecore issued variable rate industrial revenue bonds ( IRBs\u201d). These IRBs were assumed by Landec in the acquisition of Lifecore. The IRBs are collateralized by a bank letter of credit which is secured by a first mortgage on Lifecore's facility in Chaska, Minnesota. In addition, Lifecore pays an annual remarketing fee equal to 0.125% and an annual letter of credit fee of 0.75% on the outstanding principal balance.\nOn April 23, 2012 in connection with the acquisition of GreenLine Holding Company, Apio entered into three loan agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation and/or its affiliates ( GE Capital\u201d):\n 1) A five-year, $25.0 million asset-based working capital revolving line of credit, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%, with availability based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances of Apio and its subsidiaries. \n 2) A $12.7 million capital equipment loan which matures in seven years payable in monthly principal and interest payments of $175,356 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.39% per annum. \n 3) A $19.2 million real estate loan, $1.2 million of which was paid in April 2013, with the remaining principal balance due in ten years. The real estate loan has a fifteen year amortization period due in monthly principal and interest payments of $133,060 with interest based on a fixed rate of 4.02% per annum. The principal balance remaining at the end of the ten year term is due in one lump sum on April 23, 2022. \nOn July 17, 2014, Apio entered into an amendment with GE Capital, which amended the revolving line of credit dated April 23, 2012 among the parties. Under the amendment, the revolving line of credit increased from $25 million to $40 million, the interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.0% to LIBOR plus 1.75%, and the term was extended to July 17, 2019, among other changes. The availability under the revolving line of credit is based on the combination of the eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (availability was $22.6 million at May 29, 2016). Apio's revolving line of credit has a fee of 0.375% per annum on the unused amount. At May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, there was $3.5 million and zero, respectively, outstanding under Apio's revolving line of credit.\nAlso on July 17, 2014, Apio entered into a new equipment loan with GE Capital whereby Apio could borrow up to $25 million based on eligible equipment purchases between August 1, 2012 and August 31, 2015. Each borrowing under this new equipment loan has a five year term with a seven year amortization period. On August 28, 2014, Apio borrowed $7.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.68%. On November 24, 2014, Apio borrowed an additional $4.1 million under the new equipment loan at a fixed rate of 3.74%. This loan was terminated upon entering into the commitment letter with GE Capital on May 15, 2015.\nOn May 15, 2015, GE Capital and Apio entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which GE Capital committed to lend Apio up to approximately $14.7 million in equipment financing and approximately $7.7 million in real property financing. The equipment loan and the real property loan will be made pursuant to existing loan agreements dated as of April 23, 2012, as amended May 17, 2013 and July 17, 2014. The equipment loan is available to finance purchases of equipment between May 1, 2015 and June 30, 2017. The real property loan will be used to finance the expansion of Apio's facility in Hanover, PA. On February 26, 2016, the Company borrowed $9.1 million under the equipment loan at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of five years and $7.7 million under the real property loan also at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.25% with a term of ten years.\nThe GE real property, equipment and line of credit agreements (collectively the GE Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Apio and its subsidiaries. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary events of default under which obligations could be accelerated or increased. The GE Capital real estate and equipment loans are guaranteed by Landec, and Landec has pledged its equity interest in Apio as collateral under the line of credit agreement. The GE Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Apio's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends, sell stock or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; or (7) make changes in Apio's corporate structure. In addition, Apio must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if the availability under its line of credit falls below $12.0 million. Apio was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015.\nAlso on May 15, 2015, Apio and Bank of America ( BofA\u201d) entered into a commitment letter and loan agreement, pursuant to which Apio will be permitted to borrow up to $15.0 million to finance equipment purchases made between October 1, 2014 and April 30, 2016 (the BofA Loan\u201d). Each borrowing under the BofA Loan will have a five-year term and a fixed interest rate based on the 2.5-year swap rate at the time of borrowing. Borrowings will be secured by equipment financed with proceeds of the BofA Loan. In addition, on May 15, 2015, Landec and BofA entered into a Guaranty, pursuant to which Landec guaranteed Apio's payment obligations under the BofA Loan. On May 29, 2015, Apio borrowed $3.8 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.79%. On November 27, 2015, Apio borrowed $4.2 million under the BofA Loan at a fixed rate of 2.92%.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, Apio capitalized $200,000 of loan origination fees from new equipment loans and/or amendments with GE Capital and BofA. Loan origination fees of $397,000 and zero were capitalized in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amortization of loan origination fees for Apio recorded to interest expense for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $293,000, $206,000 and $187,000, respectively. Unamortized loan origination fees were $1.1 million and $1.2 million at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn May 23, 2012, Lifecore entered into two financing agreements with BMO Harris Bank N.A. and/or its affiliates ( BMO Harris\u201d), collectively (the Lifecore Loan Agreements\u201d):\n (1) A $12.0 million term loan which matures in four years due in monthly payments of $250,000 with interest payable monthly based on a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2% (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan was paid off on May 2, 2016. \n (2) A Reimbursement Agreement pursuant to which BMO Harris caused its affiliate Bank of Montreal to issue an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $3.5 million (the Letter of Credit\u201d) which is securing the IRBs described above. \nOn May 22, 2015, Lifecore entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with BMO Harris which includes a two-year, $10.0 million asset-based working capital revolving line of credit, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.85%, with availability based on the combination of Lifecore's eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances (availability was $9.6 million at May 29, 2016) and with no unused fee. As of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nThe obligations of Lifecore under the Lifecore Loan Agreements and Credit Agreement (collectively Lifecore Debt Agreements\u201d) are secured by liens on all of the property of Lifecore. The Lifecore Debt Agreements contain customary covenants, such as limitations on the ability to (1) incur indebtedness or grant liens or negative pledges on Lifecore's assets; (2) make loans or other investments; (3) pay dividends or repurchase stock or other securities; (4) sell assets; (5) engage in mergers; (6) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (7) adopt certain benefit plans; and (8) make changes in Lifecore's corporate structure. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, Lifecore must maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.0 if Lifecore's unrestricted cash balance is less than 50% of total funded debt at the end of each fiscal quarter and (b) a net debt cash flow leverage ratio of less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. Lifecore was in compliance with all financial covenants as of May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015. Unamortized loan origination fees for the Lifecore Debt Agreements were zero and $48,000 at May 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe market value of the Company's debt approximates its recorded value as the interest rates on each debt instrument approximate current market rates.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of May 29, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe interest payment amounts above include (1) all of the GE Capital and BofA fixed rate loans (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a list of the Company's fixed rate loans), (2) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate loans with GE Capital entered into on February 26, 2016 based on the five year historical average 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% or 2.73% and (3) the estimated interest rate payment on the variable rate IRB based on the five year historical interest rate average for the Municipal Swap Index plus 20 basis points plus the letter of credit and remarketing fees of 0.875% resulting in an estimated rate of 1.18%.\nLandec is not a party to any agreements with, or commitments to, any special purpose entities that would constitute material off-balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments.\nLandec's future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of its research and development programs; the continued development of marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; the ability of Landec to establish and maintain new licensing arrangements; any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities; weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce, the timing and amount, if any, of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; the ability to comply with regulatory requirements; the emergence of competitive technology and market forces; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; and other factors. If Landec's currently available funds, together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs, Landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners, additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities. There can be no assurance that additional funds, if required, will be available to Landec on favorable terms, if at all.\nLandec believes that its cash from operations, along with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nYear

points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Landec's revenues were $541.1 million in fiscal year 2016, flat compared to $539.3 million in fiscal year 2015. Revenues decreased 2% for Apio Packaged Fresh Vegetables due to lower volume sales, while Lifecore Biomaterials revenues increased 25% due to higher development service revenues. \n\n- Gross profit was $71.0 million in fiscal 2016 versus $65.4 million in fiscal 2015. Gross margin increased for Lifecore due to favorable product mix, while Apio's gross margin decreased due to produce shortages resulting in higher costs.\n\n- Operating expenses rose 24% to $49.5 million in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased investment in new Apio salad kit products, bonuses at Lifecore, and higher corporate stock compensation. \n\n- Net income was $10.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $17.9 million in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 included a $34 million non-cash impairment charge for the GreenLine tradename.\n\n- Cash from operating activities was $21.8 million in fiscal 2016 versus $26.2 million in fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to an increase in working capital.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $40.9 million in fiscal 2016, mainly to expand facilities for Apio and Lifecore. \n\n- Total debt increased to $54.7 million at fiscal year-end 2016 from $40.1 million at fiscal year-end 2015, primarily to fund capacity expansions.\n\nIn summary, revenues were flat but profits decreased in fiscal 2016, as Landec invested significantly in facilities, new products, and personnel to support long-term growth of Apio Packaged Vegetables and Lifecore Biomaterials."}
