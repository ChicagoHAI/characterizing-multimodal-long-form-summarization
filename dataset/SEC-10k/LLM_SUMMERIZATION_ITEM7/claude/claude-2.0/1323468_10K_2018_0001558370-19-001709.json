We own, control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products and renewable fuels in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (collectively, the Northeast\u201d). We are one of the region's largest independent owners, suppliers and operators of gasoline stations and convenience stores. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 1,579 owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, including 297 directly operated convenience stores, primarily in the Northeast. We are also one of the largest distributors of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in the New England states and New York. We engage in the purchasing, selling, gathering, blending, storing and logistics of transporting petroleum and related products, including gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (such as ethanol), distillates (such as home heating oil, diesel and kerosene), residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and in the transportation of petroleum products and renewable fuels by rail from the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada.\nCollectively, we sold approximately $12.3 billion of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we had other revenues of approximately $0.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from convenience store sales at our directly operated stores, rental income from dealer leased and commissioned agent leased gasoline stations and from cobranding arrangements, and sundries.\nWe base our pricing on spot prices, fixed prices or indexed prices and routinely use the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d) or other counterparties to hedge the risk inherent in buying and selling commodities. Through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives, we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations.\n2018 Events\nSeries A Preferred Unit Offering-On August 7, 2018, we issued 2,760,000 9.75% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d) for $25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933. We used the proceeds, net of underwriting discount and expenses, of $66.4 million to reduce indebtedness under our credit agreement. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Cheshire Oil Company, LLC-On July 24, 2018, we acquired the assets of ten company-operated gasoline stations and convenience stores from New Hampshire-based Cheshire Oil Company, LLC ( Cheshire\u201d) for approximately $33.4 million, including inventory. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Champlain Oil Company, Inc.-On July 17, 2018, we acquired retail fuel and convenience store assets from Vermont-based Champlain Oil Company, Inc. ( Champlain\u201d) for approximately $138.4 million, including inventory. The acquisition included 37 company-operated gasoline stations with Jiffy Mart-branded convenience stores in Vermont and New Hampshire and approximately 24 fuel sites that are either owned or leased, including lessee dealer and commission agent locations. The transaction also included fuel supply agreements for approximately 65 gasoline stations, primarily in Vermont and New Hampshire. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2017 Events\nAcquisition of Gasoline and Convenience Store Assets-On October 18, 2017, we completed the acquisition of retail gasoline and convenience store assets from Honey Farms, Inc. ( Honey Farms\u201d) in a cash transaction. The acquisition included 11 company-operated retail sites with gasoline and convenience stores and 22 company-operated stand-alone convenience stores. All of the sites are located in the greater Worcester, Massachusetts area. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSale of Natural Gas and Electricity Brokerage Businesses-On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses for a purchase price of approximately $17.3 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. Proceeds from the sale amounted to approximately $16.3 million, and we realized a gain on the sale of $14.2 million. Prior to the sale, the results of the natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses were included in the Commercial segment.\n2016 Events\nEarly Termination of Railcar Sublease-On December 21, 2016 (effective December 31, 2016), we voluntarily terminated early a sublease with a counterparty for 1,610 railcars that were underutilized due to unfavorable market conditions in the crude oil by rail market. Separately, we entered into a fleet management services agreement (effective January 1, 2017) with the counterparty, pursuant to which we provide railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services on behalf of the counterparty. As a result of the sublease termination, we recognized one-time discounted lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting of (i) $61.7 million cash consideration, (ii) $10.7 million of accrued incremental costs relating to our obligations under the sublease, and (iii) $8.3 million associated with derecognizing accumulated prepaid rent.\nThe $61.7 million cash consideration represents a discount of $10.2 million from $71.9 million in railcar lease payments that we would have been obligated to pay over the next three years. The termination of the sublease eliminated lease payments related to these railcars of approximately $30.0 million in 2017 and future lease payments of approximately $29.0 million and $13.0 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In addition to the discounted lease termination payment, the one-time expense includes costs for future railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services, as well as certain non-cash accounting adjustments associated with the early termination. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment-In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nSale of Gasoline Stations-On August 22, 2016, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., a subsidiary of ours, sold to Mirabito Holdings, Inc. 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in New York and Pennsylvania (the Drake Sites\u201d) for an aggregate total cash purchase price of approximately $40.0 million. In connection with closing, the parties entered into long-term supply contracts for branded and unbranded gasoline and other petroleum products.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction-On June 29, 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to these sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nExpanded Retail Network-In April 2016, we expanded our gasoline station and convenience-store network in Western Massachusetts with the addition of 22 leased retail sites ( 22 leased sites\u201d). Located in the Pittsfield and Springfield areas, these sites were added through long-term leases.\nOperating Segments\nWe purchase refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers, crude oil producers, major and independent oil companies and trading companies. We operate our businesses under three segments: (i) Wholesale, (ii) Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations ( GDSO\u201d) and (iii) Commercial.\nWholesale\nIn our Wholesale segment, we engage in the logistics of selling, gathering, blending, storing and transporting refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane. We transport these products by railcars, barges and/or pipelines pursuant to spot or long-term contracts. From time to time, we aggregate crude oil by truck or pipeline in the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada, transport it by rail and ship it by barge to refiners. We sell home heating oil, branded and unbranded gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and propane to home heating oil and propane retailers and wholesale distributors. Generally, customers use their own vehicles or contract carriers to take delivery of the gasoline, distillates and propane at bulk terminals and inland storage facilities that we own or control or at which we have throughput or exchange arrangements. Ethanol is shipped primarily by rail and by barge.\nIn our Wholesale segment, we obtain Renewable Identification Numbers ( RIN\u201d) in connection with our purchase of ethanol which is used for bulk trading purposes or for blending with gasoline through our terminal system. A RIN is a renewable identification number associated with government-mandated renewable fuel standards. To evidence that the required volume of renewable fuel is blended with gasoline, obligated parties must retire sufficient RINs to cover their Renewable Volume Obligation ( RVO\u201d). Our U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) obligations relative to renewable fuel reporting are comprised of foreign gasoline and diesel that we may import and blending operations at certain facilities.\nGasoline Distribution and Station Operations\nIn our GDSO segment, gasoline distribution includes sales of branded and unbranded gasoline to gasoline station operators and sub-jobbers. Station operations include (i) convenience stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers, from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sundries (such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions).\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, primarily in the Northeast, that consisted of the following:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompany operated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommissioned agents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLessee dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContract dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt our company-operated stores, we operate the gasoline stations and convenience stores with our employees, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station. At commissioned agent locations, we own the gasoline inventory, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station and pay the commissioned agent a fee related to the gallons sold. We receive rental income from commissioned agent leased gasoline stations for the leasing of the convenience store premises, repair bays and other businesses that may be conducted by the commissioned agent. At dealer-leased locations, the dealer purchases gasoline from us, and the dealer sets the retail price of gasoline at the dealer's station. We also receive rental income from (i) dealer-leased gasoline stations and (ii) cobranding arrangements. We also supply gasoline to locations owned and/or leased by independent contract dealers. Additionally, we have contractual relationships with distributors in certain New England states pursuant to which we source and supply these distributors' gasoline stations with ExxonMobil-branded gasoline.\nCommercial\nIn our Commercial segment, we include sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline, home heating oil, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and bunker fuel. In the case of public sector commercial and industrial end user customers, we sell products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms. We generally arrange for the delivery of the product to the customer's designated location, and we respond to publicly-issued requests for product proposals and quotes. Our Commercial segment also includes sales of custom blended fuels delivered by barges or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity.\nSeasonality\nDue to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline. Therefore, our volumes in gasoline are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. As demand for some of our refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally greater during the winter months, heating oil and residual oil volumes are generally higher during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. These factors may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nOutlook\nThis section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry-wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future, both in the short-term and in the long-term. Our results of operations and financial condition depend, in part, upon the following:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur businesses are influenced by the overall markets for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and increases and/or decreases in the prices of these products may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders and the amount of borrowing available for working capital under our credit agreement.\u2003Results from our purchasing, storing, terminalling, transporting, selling and blending operations are influenced by prices for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, price volatility and the market for such products. Prices in the overall markets for these products may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our margins can be significantly impacted by the forward product pricing curve, often referred to as the futures market. We typically hedge our exposure to petroleum product and renewable fuel price moves with futures contracts and, to a lesser extent, swaps. In markets where future prices are higher than current prices, referred to as contango, we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future. In markets where future prices are lower than current prices, referred to as backwardation, inventories can depreciate in value and hedging costs are more expensive. For this reason, in these backward markets, we attempt to reduce our inventories in order to minimize these effects. When prices for the products we sell rise, some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes, and their customers, in turn, may adopt conservation measures which reduce consumption, thereby reducing demand for product. Furthermore, when prices increase rapidly and dramatically, we may be unable to promptly pass our additional costs on to our customers, resulting in lower margins which could adversely affect our results of operations. Higher prices for the products we sell may (1) diminish our access to trade credit support and/or cause it to become more expensive and (2) decrease the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our credit agreement as a result of total available commitments, borrowing base limitations and advance rates thereunder. When prices for the products we sell decline, our exposure to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of our forward contracts may be increased as they and/or their customers may breach their contracts and purchase the products we sell at the then lower market price from a competitor. A significant decrease in\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td>the price for crude oil could adversely affect the economics of domestic crude oil production which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. A significant decrease in crude oil differentials could also have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. The prolonged decline in crude oil prices and crude oil differentials has indicated an impairment of our long-lived assets at our terminals in North Dakota. As a result of these events, we recognized a goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $149.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions and expending capital for growth projects, although there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or growth projects or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions or growth projects.\u2003We are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers and lessors of existing (or suitable for development) terminalling, storage, logistics and/or marketing assets, including gasoline stations, convenience stores and related businesses. Our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions and/or accretive development projects. We may be unable to execute such accretive transactions for a number of reasons, including the following: (1) we are unable to identify attractive transaction candidates or negotiate acceptable terms; (2) we are unable to obtain financing for such transactions on economically acceptable terms; or (3) we are outbid by competitors. In addition, we may consummate transactions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive but that ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events were to occur, our future growth and ability to increase or maintain distributions on our common units could be limited. We can give no assurance that our transaction efforts will be successful or that any such efforts will be completed on terms that are favorable to us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity.\u2003In the past, world financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit. Possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in the availability of borrowings under our credit agreement, increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and our contractual counterparties requiring us to provide collateral. In addition, we could experience a tightening of trade credit from our suppliers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe depend upon marine, pipeline, rail and truck transportation services for a substantial portion of our logistics activities in transporting the products we sell.

In addition, accidents, labor disputes between providers and their employees and labor renegotiations, including strikes, lockouts or a work stoppage, shortage of railcars, mechanical difficulties or bottlenecks and disruptions in transportation logistics could also disrupt our activities. These events could result in service disruptions and increased cost which could also adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Other disruptions, such as those due to an act of terrorism or war, could also adversely affect our businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe have contractual obligations for certain transportation assets such as railcars, barges and pipelines.\u2003A decline in demand for (i) the products we sell or (ii) our logistics activities, could result in a decrease in the utilization of our transportation assets, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOur gasoline financial results, with particular impact to our GDSO segment, are seasonal and can be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year.\u2003Due to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline that we sell.

We obtain a significant portion of these sales during the winter months. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWarmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\u2003Weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil. Because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the Northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnergy efficiency, higher prices, new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products.\u2003Higher prices and new technologies and alternative fuel sources, such as electric, hybrid or battery powered motor vehicles, could reduce the demand for transportation fuels and adversely impact our sales of transportation fuels. A reduction in sales of transportation fuels could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil. Consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades. We could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government-mandated controls or regulations further promoting the use of cleaner fuels. End users who are dual-fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas. Other end users may elect to convert to natural gas. During a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas, dual-fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas. During periods of increasing home heating oil prices relative to the price of natural gas, residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas. As described above, such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChanges in government usage mandates and tax credits could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which could negatively impact our sales.\u2003The EPA has implemented a RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program seeks to promote the incorporation of biofuels in the nation's fuel supply and, to that end, sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the United States. A RIN is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the United States. We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RIN prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations related to the amount of RINs required and the total amounts that can be generated, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, and levels of transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline and ethanol, taking into consideration the EPA's regulations on the RFS program and oxygenate blending requirements. A reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate or oxygenate blending requirements could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which in turn could adversely affect our future gasoline and ethanol sales. In addition, changes in blending requirements or broadening the definition of what constitutes a renewable fuel could affect the price of RINs which could impact the magnitude of the mark-to-market liability recorded for the deficiency, if any, in our RIN position relative to our RVO at a point in time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe may not be able to fully implement or capitalize upon planned growth projects.\u2003We could have a number of organic growth projects that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital in the aggregate. Many of these projects involve numerous regulatory, environmental, commercial and legal uncertainties beyond our control. As these projects are undertaken, required approvals, permits and licenses may not be obtained, may be delayed or may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects. Moreover, revenues associated with these organic growth projects may not increase immediately upon the expenditures of funds with respect to a particular project and these projects may be completed behind schedule or in excess of budgeted cost. We may pursue and complete projects in anticipation of market demand that dissipates or market growth that never materializes. As a result of these uncertainties, the anticipated benefits associated with our capital projects may not be achieved.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew, stricter environmental laws and other industry-related regulations or environmental litigation could significantly impact our operations and/or increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\u2003Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating, among other matters, logistics activities, product quality specifications and other environmental matters. The trend in environmental regulation has been towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. Risks related to our environmental permits, including the risk of noncompliance, permit interpretation, permit modification, renewal of permits on less favorable terms, judicial or administrative challenges to permits by citizens groups or federal, state or local entities or permit revocation are inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We may not be able to renew the permits necessary for our operations, or we may be forced to accept terms in future permits that limit our operations or result in additional compliance costs. In recent years, the transport of crude oil and ethanol has become subject to additional regulation. The establishment of more stringent design or construction standards, or other requirements for railroad tank cars that are used to transport crude oil and ethanol with too short of a timeframe for compliance may lead to shortages of compliant railcars available to transport crude oil and ethanol, which could adversely affect our businesses. Likewise, in recent years, efforts have commenced to seek to use federal, state and local laws to contest issuance of permits, contest renewal of permits and restrict the types of railroad tanks cars that can be used to deliver products, including, without limitation, crude oil and ethanol to bulk storage terminals. Were such laws to come into effect and were they to survive appeals and judicial review, they would potentially expose our operations to duplicative and possibly inconsistent regulation. There can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. In recent years environmental interest groups have filed suit against companies in the energy industry related to climate change. Should such suits succeed, we could face additional compliance costs or litigation risks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nEvaluating Our Results of Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These measurements include: (1) product margin, (2) gross profit, (3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (4) distributable cash flow, (5) selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d), (6) operating expenses and (7) degree days.\nProduct Margin\nWe view product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. We review product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis. We define product margin as our product sales minus\nproduct costs. Product sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline, distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, as well as convenience store sales, gasoline station rental income and revenue generated from our logistics activities when we engage in the storage, transloading and shipment of products owned by others. Product costs primarily include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale as well as product costs related to convenience store items and costs associated with our logistics activities. We also look at product margin on a per unit basis (product margin divided by volume). Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements to assess our businesses. Product margin should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our product margin may not be comparable to product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies.\nGross Profit\nWe define gross profit as our product margin minus terminal and gasoline station related depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used as supplemental financial measures by management and may be used by external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nour operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale, marketing, storing and distribution of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and in the gasoline stations and convenience stores business, without regard to financing methods and capital structure; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted for gains or losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nDistributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment. Distributable cash flow as defined by our partnership agreement is net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures, as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner that are extraordinary or non-recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow.\nDistributable cash flow as used in our partnership agreement also determines our ability to make cash distributions on our incentive distribution rights. The investment community also uses a distributable cash flow metric similar to the metric used in our partnership agreement with respect to publicly traded partnerships to indicate whether or not such partnerships have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain distributions on preferred or common units or support an increase in quarterly cash distributions on common units. Our partnership agreement does not permit adjustments for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges.\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses include, among other things, marketing costs, corporate overhead, employee salaries and benefits, pension and 401(k) plan expenses, discretionary bonuses, non-interest financing costs, professional fees and information technology expenses. Employee-related expenses including employee salaries, discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes, benefits, and pension and 401(k) plan expenses are paid by our general partner which, in turn, are reimbursed for these expenses by us.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals, transload facilities and gasoline stations and convenience stores used in our businesses. Lease payments, maintenance and repair, property taxes, utilities, credit card fees, taxes, labor and labor-related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. The majority of these expenses remains relatively stable, independent of the volumes through our system, but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nDegree Days\nA degree day\u201d is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of 65\u00b0F. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long-term (multi-year) average, or normal, to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service and officially archived by the National Climatic Data Center. For purposes of evaluating our results of operations, we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the National Weather Service at its Logan International Airport station in Boston, Massachusetts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following table provides a summary of some of the key performance indicators that may be used to assess our results of operations.

Our aggregate volume of product sold was 5.8 billion gallons and 4.7 billion gallons for 2018 and 2017, respectively an increase of 1.1 billion gallons. The increase in volume sold includes an increase of 930 million gallons in our Wholesale segment, reflecting an increase in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks offset by declines in volume sold in crude oil and distillates, and increases of 116 million gallons in our Commercial segment and 51 million gallons in our GDSO segment.\nOur total sales were $8.9 billion and $8.2 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 8%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in volume sold, primarily in our Wholesale segment. Our aggregate volume of product sold was 4.7 billion gallons and 5.1 billion gallons for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of 0.4 billion gallons. The decline in volume sold includes decreases of 364 million gallons in our Wholesale segment and 6 million gallons in our GDSO segment. We had an increase of 3 million gallons in our Commercial segment.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $650.4 million and $583.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $67.3 million, or 12%, primarily due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire in July 2018 and Honey Farms in October 2017 (collectively our Recent Acquisitions\u201d) and to higher fuel margins in our GDSO segment, largely in the fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable market conditions in our Wholesale segment, primarily in gasoline and distillates.\nOur gross profit was $583.1 million and $546.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $36.6 million, or 7%, primarily due to improved product margins in gasoline distribution in our GDSO segment and crude oil in our Wholesale segment. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by product margin declines in other oils and related products in our Wholesale segment due to less favorable market conditions and in station operations in our GDSO segment due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016.\nResults for Wholesale Segment\nGasoline and Gasoline Blendstocks. Sales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $4.7 billion and $2.1 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 126%, due to increases in prices and volume sold, primarily in gasoline. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $76.7 million and $82.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline, offset by improved margins in gasoline blendstocks, primarily ethanol, due to more favorable market conditions. Our product margin in 2017 benefited from weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017 that did not occur in 2018.\nSales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion, or 5%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $82.1 million and $83.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 2%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil sales and logistics revenues were $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 76%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude by rail differentials continued to be challenged. Our crude oil product margin was $7.2 million and $7.3 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, primarily due to lower contract revenue, partially offset by lower pipeline related expense, lower railcar lease and related expenses and lower terminal lease expense associated with the expiration of a terminal lease in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in\nrevenue recognized related to a take-or-pay contract with one particular customer compared to $21.6 million in revenue recognized in 2018 due to the expiration of that contract in June 2018. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility.\nCrude oil sales and logistics revenues were approximately $0.5 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $82.3 million, or 15%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude oil did not discount sufficiently to make rail transport to the East Coast competitive with imports. Our crude oil product margin was $7.3 million and negative $13.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $20.4 million, or 155%. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in revenue as compared to $28.0 million in 2016 related to the absence of logistics nominations from one particular contract customer, and a $34.4 million decrease in railcar lease expense to $11.3 million as a result of our early termination of a sublease in December 2016. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility and by less volume through our system.\nOther Oils and Related Products. Sales from other oils and related products (primarily distillates, residual oil and propane) were $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $323.5 million, or 19%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in distillate volume sold. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $53.4 million and $62.8 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in distillates in the first and third quarters of 2018, offset by improved margins in distillates in the fourth quarter. Our product margin in other oils and related products for both 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted due to warmer than normal temperatures.\nSales from other oils and related products were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $62.8 million and $74.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 15%. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted due to less favorable market conditions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017.\nResults for Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations Segment\nGasoline Distribution. Sales from gasoline distribution were $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in prices for most of 2018 and to an increase in volume sold due to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $373.3 million and $326.5 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $46.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher fuel margins as wholesale gasoline prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2018 and to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin for 2018 was negatively impacted by rising wholesale gasoline prices during the first six months of the year. Rising wholesale gasoline prices typically compress our gasoline product margin and declining wholesale gasoline prices typically improve our gasoline product margin, the extent of which depends on the magnitude and duration.\nSales from gasoline distribution were $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 10%, due to an increase in prices. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $326.5 million and $289.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $37.1 million, or 13%. The increase in our gasoline product margin was primarily due to declining wholesale gasoline prices during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nStation Operations. Our station operations, which include (i) convenience stores sales at our directly operated stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers or from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sale of sundries, such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions, collectively generated revenues of $0.4 billion for each of 2018 and 2017, increasing by $75.3 million, or 21%. Our product margin from station operations was $203.1 million and $175.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $28.1 million, or 16%. The increases in sales and product margin are primarily due to our Recent Acquisitions, partially offset by the\nsale of non-strategic sites.\nRevenues from our station operations, were $0.4 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $19.8 million, or 5%. Our product margin from station operations was $175.0 million and $183.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 5%. The decreases in sales and product margin in 2017 are primarily due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by the addition of leased company operated sites in April 2016 and the acquisition of Honey Farms in October 2017.\nResults for Commercial Segment\nOur commercial sales were $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $426.6 million, or 50%, due to increases in prices and in volume sold. Our commercial product margin was $23.6 million and $17.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $5.7 million, or 32%, primarily due to an increase in bunkering activity.\nOur commercial sales were $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing by $157.1 million, or 23%, primarily due to higher prices. Our commercial product margin was $17.9 million and $24.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 25%. The decreases in sales and product margin are primarily due to the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $171.0 million and $155.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $16.0 million, or 10%, including increases of $4.6 million in incentive compensation, $3.2 million in acquisition costs, $2.1 million in wages and benefits, $1.2 million in license fees, $1.1 million in depreciation, $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $2.9 million in various SG&A expenses. The increase in acquisitions costs consists of $3.9 million incurred in 2018 related to Champlain and Cheshire compared to $0.7 million incurred in 2017 related to Honey Farms.\nSG&A expenses were $155.0 million and $149.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $5.3 million, or 4%, including increases of $5.2 million in incentive compensation and $2.4 million in professional fees. In addition, during 2017, we incurred $1.1 million for certain costs in connection with a compensation funding agreement with our general partner (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in SG&A expenses was offset, in part, by decreases of $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $0.6 million in salaries and wages, as well as a decline of $1.9 million in severance charges incurred primarily in 2016 related to a reduction in our workforce.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $321.1 million and $283.6 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $37.5 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase of $35.5 million associated with our GDSO operations, due largely to our Recent Acquisitions and to increases in credit card fees, partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the sale of sites. Operating expenses associated with our terminal operations increased by $2.0 million.\nOperating expenses were $283.6 million and $288.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 2%. Operating expenses decreased by $2.6 million associated with our GDSO operations due, in part, to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by increases in credit card fees due to higher wholesale gasoline prices and in rent expense associated with the addition of leased sites, and the Honey Farms acquisition in October 2017. Operating expenses also decreased by $2.5 million at our Basin Transload facilities in North Dakota due to less activity. In addition, in 2016, we incurred $3.1 million in costs associated with cleaning tanks and related infrastructure at our Oregon facility in order to convert the facility to ethanol transloading. The decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase of $3.3 million associated with our terminal operations.\nGain (loss) on Trustee Taxes\nIn 2018, we recognized a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, which tax credit program expired in 2011. Based upon the significant passage of time from that 2011 expiration date, including underlying statutes of limitation, as of January 31, 2018 we determined that the liability was no longer required.\nIn 2017, we recognized a loss on trustee taxes of $16.2 million related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Trustee Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nLease Exit and Termination Gain (Expenses)\nIn 2018, we were released from certain of our obligations to provide railcar storage, freight, insurance and other services for railcars under a fleet management services agreement associated with our 2016 voluntary termination of a railcar sublease. The release of certain of those obligations resulted in a $3.5 million reduction of the remaining accrued incremental costs.\nIn 2016, the lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million represent a one-time discounted lease termination expense related to the early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars leased from a third party.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Leases\u201d for additional information.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense related to our intangible assets was $11.0 million, $9.2 million and $9.4 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases of $1.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the intangibles acquired in the Recent Acquisitions.\nNet (Loss) Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets\nWe had net losses on the sale and disposition of assets of ($5.9 million), ($12.5 million) and ($20.5 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the sale of GDSO sites. Included in the net loss on sale and disposition of assets is approximately $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of goodwill derecognized as part of the site divestitures. For 2017, we recorded a $14.2 million gain associated with the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nIn 2018 and 2017, we recognized a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, relating to long-lived assets used at certain gasoline stations and convenience stores associated with our GDSO segment. In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $89.1 million and $86.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of\n$2.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher average balances on our credit facilities for 2018, in part due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, an increase in inventory attributable to both volume and price, and an increase in interest rates for 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest expense was $86.2 million and $86.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, primarily due to lower average balances on our credit facilities and lower interest rates due to the May 2016 expiration of our interest rate swap, partially offset by a full year of our financing obligation recognized in connection with our sale-leaseback transaction entered into in June 2016.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIncome tax (expense) benefit was ($5.6 million), $23.6 million and ($0.1 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The income tax (expense) benefit recognized primarily reflects the income tax (expense) benefit from the operating results of GMG, which is a taxable entity for federal and state income tax purposes. The income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 ( the Act\u201d). As a result of the enactment of this law, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are anticipated to reverse in the future, resulting in a decrease to our net deferred tax liability of $22.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was recorded based on provisional amounts. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, including the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. There were no material adjustments to the provisional tax expense estimate that was previously recorded related to the Act. See Notes 2 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nIn February 2013, we acquired a 60% membership interest in Basin Transload. The net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $39.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represents the 40% noncontrolling ownership of the net loss reported. The noncontrolling interest for 2016 includes a $35.8 million goodwill and long-lived asset impairment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and distributions and to service our indebtedness. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, amounts available under our working capital revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Please read -Credit Agreement\u201d for more information on our working capital revolving credit facility.\nWorking capital was $292.2 million and $209.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $82.7 million, in part due to an increase of $35.7 million in inventories resulting from an increase in inventory volume and decreases of $67.7 million in trustee taxes payable and $23.4 million in the current portion of our working capital revolving credit facility which represents the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in trustee taxes payable was largely attributable to the $52.6 million extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and the settlement of a trustee tax loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in working capital was partially offset by a decrease of $82.5 million in accounts receivable, due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer in 2017.\nCash Distributions\nCommon Units\nDuring 2018, we paid the following cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistribution Paid for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Distribution Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQuarterly Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFebruary 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFourth quarter 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMay 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFirst quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAugust 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSecond quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovember 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThird quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, on January 28, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.50 per unit ($2.00 per unit on an annualized basis) on all of our outstanding common units for the period from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 to our common unitholders of record as of the close of business February 8, 2019. This distribution resulted in our reaching our second target level distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. On February 14, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $17.3 million.\nPreferred Units\nOn November 15, 2018, we paid a cash distribution to holders of the Series A Preferred Units in the total amount of $1.8 million covering the period from August 7, 2018 (the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Units) through November 14, 2018.\nIn addition, on January 22, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.609375 per unit ($2.4375 per unit on an annualized basis) on our Series A Preferred Units for the period from November 15, 2018 through February 14, 2019 to our preferred unitholders of record as of the opening of business on February 1, 2019. On February 15, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $1.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash.

See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to purchase commitments and sublease information related to certain lease agreements.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade and enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. We categorize our capital requirements as either maintenance capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to repair or replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of, or revenues generated by, existing assets and extend their useful lives. Maintenance capital expenditures also include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tank and pipeline integrity and safety and to address certain environmental regulations. We anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by operations. We had approximately $38.6 million, $34.7 million and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, of which approximately $33.6 million, $27.9 million and $25.7 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are related to our investments in our gasoline stations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\nExpansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets to grow our businesses or expand our existing facilities, such as projects that increase our operating capacity or revenues by, for example, increasing dock capacity and tankage, diversifying product availability, investing in raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry gasoline stations and convenience stores, increasing storage flexibility at various terminals and by adding terminals to our storage network. We have the ability to fund our expansion capital expenditures through cash from operations or our credit agreement or by issuing debt securities or additional equity. We had approximately $175.7 million, $29.2 million and $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures, including acquisitions, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2018, the $175.7 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $145.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisitions of Cheshire and Champlain. In addition, we had $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to investments in our gasoline stations, including, in part, raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry sites.\nIn 2017, the $29.2 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $14.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisition of Honey Farms. In addition, we had $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures which consists of $8.7 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and $6.4 million in other expansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nIn 2016, the $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately (i) $25.4 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and includes $5.7 million related to the addition of 22 leased sites in April 2016; (ii) $7.9 million in costs associated with our terminal assets, including $7.5 million in dock and infrastructure expansion at our Oregon facility, and (iii) $5.0 million in other\nexpansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nWe currently expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million and expansion capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million in 2019, relating primarily to investments in our gasoline station business. These current estimates depend, in part, on the timing of completion of projects, availability of equipment, weather and unanticipated events or opportunities requiring additional maintenance or investments.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and the ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n168,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n348,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(119,886)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(225,720)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(61,644)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(281,968)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities generally reflects our net income, balance sheet changes arising from inventory purchasing patterns, the timing of collections on our accounts receivable, the seasonality of parts of our businesses, fluctuations in product prices, working capital requirements and general market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.9 million and $348.4 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a year-over-year decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $179.5 million. For 2018, cash flow from operating activities was not impacted by the non-cash gain of $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. This gain was included in net income and offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability which had historically been included in trustee taxes (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $348.4 million for 2017 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $119.9 million for 2016, for a year-over-year increase in cash flows from operating activities of $468.3 million.\nThe primary drivers of the changes in operating activities include the following (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease (increase) in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n78,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(110,237)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Increase) decrease in inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(29,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n173,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(202,945)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n173,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(135,888)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,433)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(24,260)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, the decrease in accounts receivable was due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer at December 31, 2017 that was not recognized at December 31, 2018. The increase in inventories was due to higher inventory volume. The decrease in operating cash flow was also impacted by the year-over-year change in derivatives of $34.1 million due to market direction and in trustee taxes of $24.2 million. The change in trustee taxes in 2017 includes the $16.2 million payment related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nIn 2017, the decrease in inventories is due to reduced inventory volume, in part due to a change in market structure and to lower crude oil volume as compared to an increase in inventories in 2016 primarily due to higher prices. Accounts receivable decreased slightly in 2017 as compared to a $110.2 million increase in 2016 which was primarily due to higher prices and an increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer. The increase in cash flows from operating activities also reflects the period over period increase in net income which in part reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses incurred in 2016.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to higher prices. An increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable. The $182.4 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities also reflects the decrease in net income which, in part, reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses and the decline in crude oil product margin due to tight rail differentials. The change in derivatives year over year provided funds of $49.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $225.7 million for 2018 and included $138.2 million and $33.4 million in cash used to fund the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, respectively, including inventory, $38.6 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures and $3.3 million in seller note issuances, offset by $18.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. The seller note issuances represent notes we received from buyers in connection with the sale of certain of our gasoline stations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $61.6 million for 2017 and included $38.5 million in cash to fund the acquisition of Honey Farms, including inventory, $34.7 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures and $6.0 million in seller note issuances, offset by $32.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment ($16.3 million from the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses, less $0.5 million in related transaction costs, and $16.9 million primarily from the sales of GDSO sites).\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $6.4 million for 2016 and included $77.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily associated with the sale of the Drake Sites, the periodic divestiture of gasoline stations and the strategic asset divestiture program, offset by $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures.\nPlease read -Capital Expenditures\u201d for a discussion of our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $50.1 million for 2018 and included $66.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, $26.6 million in net borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $24.0 million in borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, offset by $66.0 million in cash distributions to our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) and our general partner and $0.8 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2018.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $282.0 million for 2017 and included $197.9 million in net payments on our working capital revolving credit facility, due in part to reduced inventory volume which was partially due to a change in market structure, $62.7 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner, $20.7 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility, $0.5 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2017 and $0.5 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload, offset by $0.3 million in capital contributions from our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $122.4 million for 2016 and included $176.5 million in net borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, primarily due to an increase in prices, and $62.5 million in net proceeds from our sale-leaseback transaction, offset by $62.5 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders\nand our general partner, $52.3 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility representing proceeds from asset sales which was partially offset by $61.7 million in borrowings in connection with our railcar sublease termination, and $1.8 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nSee Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for supplemental cash flow information related to our working capital revolving credit facility and revolving credit facility for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCredit Agreement\nCertain subsidiaries of ours, as borrowers, and we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, have a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility. We repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements and, therefore, classify as a current liability the portion of the working capital revolving credit facility we expect to pay down during the course of the year. The long-term portion of the working capital revolving credit facility is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year. The credit agreement matures on April 30, 2020.\nThere are two facilities under the credit agreement:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na working capital revolving credit facility to be used for working capital purposes and letters of credit in the principal amount equal to the lesser of our borrowing base and $850.0 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na $450.0 million revolving credit facility to be used for acquisitions, joint ventures, capital expenditures, letters of credit and general corporate purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the credit agreement has an accordion feature whereby we may request on the same terms and conditions then applicable to the credit agreement, provided no Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) then exists, an increase to the working capital revolving credit facility, the revolving credit facility, or both, by up to another $300.0 million, in the aggregate, for a total credit facility of up to $1.6 billion. Any such request for an increase must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our lending group will agree to fund any request by us for additional amounts in excess of the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nIn addition, the credit agreement includes a swing line pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A., as the swing line lender, may make swing line loans in U.S. dollars in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (a) $75.0 million and (b) the Aggregate WC Commitments (as defined in the credit agreement). Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined in the credit agreement). The swing line is a sub-portion of the working capital revolving credit facility and is not an addition to the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nAvailability under the working capital revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which is redetermined from time to time and based on specific advance rates on eligible current assets. Under the credit agreement, borrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility cannot exceed the then current borrowing base. Availability under the borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, such as changes in petroleum product prices, collection cycles, counterparty performance, advance rates and limits and general economic conditions. These and other events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We can provide no assurance that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nBorrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 1.50%, each depending on the Utilization Amount (as defined in the credit agreement). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 2.00%, each depending on the Combined Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\nThe average interest rates for the credit agreement were 4.0%, 3.7% and 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe credit agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the then applicable working capital rate or then applicable revolver rate (each such rate as defined in the credit agreement) per annum for each letter of credit issued. In addition, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of each facility under the credit agreement, ranging from 0.35% to 0.50% per annum.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of $473.3 million, including $220.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit of $56.0 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, the total remaining availability for borrowings and letters of credit was $770.7 million and $810.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries and is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries, Bursaw Oil LLC, Global Partners Energy Canada ULC, Warex Terminals Corporation, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., Puritan Oil Company, Inc. and Maryland Oil Company, Inc.\nThe credit agreement also includes (i) a $25.0 million general secured indebtedness basket, (ii) a $25.0 million general investment basket, (iii) a $75.0 million secured indebtedness basket to permit the borrowers to enter into a Contango Facility (as defined in the credit agreement), (iv) a Sale/Leaseback Transaction (as defined in the credit agreement) basket of $100.0 million, and (v) a basket of $50.0 million in an aggregate amount over the life of the credit agreement for the purchase of our common units, provided that no Event of Default exists or would occur immediately following such purchase(s).\nIn addition, the credit agreement provides the ability for the borrowers to repay certain junior indebtedness, subject to a $100.0 million cap, so long as no Event of Default has occurred or will exist immediately after making such repayment.\nThe credit agreement imposes financial covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum working capital amounts, a minimum combined interest coverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with the foregoing covenants at December 31, 2018. The credit agreement also contains a representation whereby there can be no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the credit agreement). In addition, the credit agreement limits distributions by us to our unitholders to the amount of Available Cash (as defined in the partnership agreement).\n6.25% Senior Notes\nOn June 19, 2014, we and GLP Finance Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 6.25% senior notes due 2022 (the 6.25% Notes\u201d) to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The 6.25% Notes were resold by the Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 6.25% Notes on June 24, 2014, the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the Indenture\u201d).\nThe 6.25% Notes mature on July 15, 2022 with interest accruing at a rate of 6.25% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2015. The 6.25% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent\nset forth in the Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 6.25% Notes may declare the 6.25% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 6.25% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 6.25% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 103.125% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2018, 101.563% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2019, and 100.0% beginning on July 15, 2020 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 6.25% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the Indenture.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 6.25% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $15.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $15.0 million.\n7.00% Senior Notes\nOn June 1, 2015, the Issuers entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 7.00% senior notes due 2023 (the 7.00% Notes\u201d) to the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 7.00% Notes were resold by the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 7.00% Notes on June 4, 2015 the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the 7.00% Notes Indenture\u201d).\nThe 7.00% Notes will mature on June 15, 2023 with interest accruing at a rate of 7.00% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2015. The 7.00% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent set forth in the 7.00% Notes Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 7.00% Notes may declare the 7.00% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 7.00% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 7.00% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 105.250% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2018, 103.500% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2019, 101.750% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2020, and 100.0% beginning June 15, 2021 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the 7.00% Notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 7.00% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the 7.00% Notes Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the 7.00% Notes Indenture.\nThe 7.00% Notes Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the 7.00% Notes Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 7.00% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the 7.00% Notes Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $50.0 million.\nFinancing Obligations\nCapitol Acquisition\nOn June 1, 2015, we acquired retail gasoline stations and dealer supply contracts from Capitol Petroleum Group ( Capitol\u201d). In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a financing obligation of $89.6 million associated with two sale-leaseback transactions by Capitol for 53 leased sites that did not meet the criteria for sale accounting. During the terms of these leases, which expire in May 2028 and September 2029, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense of approximately $9.4 million, $9.6 million and $9.6 million was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The financing obligation will amortize through expiration of the leases based upon the lease rental payments which were $9.7 million, $9.7 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $87.5 million associated with the Capitol acquisition.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction\nOn June 29, 2016, we sold to a premier institutional real estate investor (the Buyer\u201d) real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island (the Sale-Leaseback Sites\u201d) for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a Master Unitary Lease Agreement with the Buyer to lease back the real property assets sold with respect to the Sale-Leaseback Sites (such Master Lease Agreement, together with the Sale-Leaseback Sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction\u201d). The Master Unitary Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of fifteen years that expires in 2031. We have one successive option to renew the lease for a ten-year period followed by two successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods on the same terms, covenants, conditions and rental as the primary non-revocable lease term. We do not have any residual interest nor the option to repurchase any of the sites at the end of the lease term. The proceeds from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nThe sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting as of December 31, 2018 due to prohibited continuing involvement. Specifically, the sale is considered a partial-sale transaction, which is a form of continuing involvement as we did not transfer to the Buyer the storage tank systems which are considered integral equipment of the Sale-Leaseback Sites. Additionally, a portion of the sold sites have material sub-lease arrangements, which is also a form of continuing involvement. As the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites did not meet the criteria for sale accounting, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a result of not meeting the criteria for sale accounting for these sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement. As such, the property and equipment sold and leased back by us has not been derecognized and continues to be depreciated. We recognized a corresponding financing obligation of $62.5 million equal to the $63.5 million cash proceeds received for the sale of these sites, net of $1.0 million financing fees. During the term of the lease, which expires in June 2031, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Lease rental payments are recognized as both interest expense and a reduction of the principal balance associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense was $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and lease rental payments were $4.5 million, $4.5 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,\nrespectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $62.5 million associated with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur businesses of supplying refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and other business activities, involves a number of activities that are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws. For a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our businesses, please read Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties-Environmental.\u201d For additional information regarding our environmental liabilities, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and are recorded in the period in which they become known. We have identified the following estimates that, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis:\nInventory\nWe hedge substantially all of our petroleum and ethanol inventory using a variety of instruments, primarily exchange-traded futures contracts. These futures contracts are entered into when inventory is purchased and are either designated as fair value hedges against the inventory on a specific barrel basis for inventories qualifying for fair value hedge accounting or not designated and maintained as economic hedges against certain inventory of ours on a specific barrel basis. Changes in fair value of these futures contracts, as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged inventory, are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales. All hedged inventory designated in a fair value hedge relationship is valued using the lower of cost, as determined by specific identification, or net realizable value, as determined at the product level. All petroleum and ethanol inventory not designated in a fair value hedging relationship is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. RIN inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Convenience store inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, based on a weighted average cost method, or net realizable value.\nIn addition to our own inventory, we have exchange agreements for petroleum products and ethanol with unrelated third-party suppliers, whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and suppliers may draw inventory from us. Positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable. Negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable. Exchange transactions are valued using current carrying costs.\nLeases\nWe have terminal and throughput lease arrangements with various other oil terminals and third parties, certain of which arrangements have minimum usage requirements. In addition, we lease certain gasoline stations from third\nparties under long-term arrangements with various expiration dates. We also have several long-term lease agreements with Getty Realty, which enables us to supply and operate certain Getty Realty gasoline station sites, and with the Port of Columbia County (formerly known as Port of St. Helens) in Clatskanie, Oregon for land and for access rights to a rail spur and dock located at our Oregon facility.\nWe have future commitments, principally for office space and computer equipment, under the terms of operating lease arrangements. We also lease railcars and barges through various lease arrangements with various expiration dates. We have rental income from gasoline stations and cobranding arrangements and lease income from space leased to several unrelated third parties at several of our terminals.\nIn addition, in June of 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores. In connection with this sale-leaseback transaction, we are party to a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to such sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting and reporting guidance for leases requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. The lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. Lease rental expense and income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nWe will be adopting ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and do not expect this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations. However, we estimate approximately $0.3 billion of right-of-use assets and liabilities will be recognized upon adoption on our consolidated balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery, net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. We may also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales.\nContracts with customers typically contain pricing provisions that are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on quality and freight due to location differences and prevailing supply and demand conditions, as well as other factors. As a result, the price of the products fluctuates to remain competitive with other available product supplies. The revenue associated with such arrangements is recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from our logistics activities when we store, transload and ship products owned by others. Revenue from logistics services is recognized as services are provided.\nLogistics agreements may require counterparties to throughput a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period and may include make-up rights if the minimum volume is not met. We recognize revenue associated with make-up rights at the earlier of when the make-up volume is shipped, the make-up right expires or when it is determined that the likelihood that the shipper will utilize the make-up right is remote.\nWe also recognize convenience store sales of gasoline, grocery and other merchandise and sundries at the time of the sale to the customer. Gasoline station rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nProduct revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements, which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels and crude oil of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets. We recognize net exchange differentials due from exchange partners in sales upon delivery of product to an exchange partner. We recognize net exchange differentials due to exchange partners in cost of sales upon receipt of product from an exchange partner.\nThe amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTrustee Taxes\nWe collect trustee taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities, and remit such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. Examples of trustee taxes include, among other things, motor fuel excise tax and sales and use tax. As such, it is our policy to exclude trustee taxes from revenues and cost of sales and account for them as current liabilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may be subject to audits of our state and federal tax returns prepared for trustee taxes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe principally use derivative instruments, which include regulated exchange-traded futures and options contracts (collectively, exchange-traded derivatives\u201d) and physical and financial forwards and over-the counter ( OTC\u201d) swaps (collectively, OTC derivatives\u201d), to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity market prices and interest rates. We use these exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to hedge commodity price risk associated with our inventory and undelivered forward commodity purchases and sales ( physical forward contracts\u201d). We account for derivative transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and recognize derivatives instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions are presented currently in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to our brokers upon liquidation of these contracts. The fair value of these exchange-traded derivative transactions is presented on a net basis, offset by the cash balances on deposit with our brokers, presented as brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of OTC derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party upon liquidation of these contracts under current market conditions. The fair value of these OTC derivative transactions is presented on a gross basis as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, unless a legal right of offset exists. The presentation of the change in fair value of our exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivative transactions depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nDerivatives Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to hedge commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nFair Value Hedges\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to hedge price risk in commodity inventories and principally include exchange-traded futures contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item of the risk being hedged. Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operation through cost of sales. These futures contracts are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nOur fair value hedges include exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC derivative contracts that are hedges against inventory with specific futures contracts matched to specific barrels. The change in fair value of these futures contracts and the change in fair value of the underlying inventory generally provide an offset to each other in the consolidated statement of operations.\nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge interest rate risk from fluctuations in interest rates and may include various interest rate derivative instruments entered into with major financial institutions. For a\nderivative instrument being designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations through interest expense in the same period that the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations immediately.\nDerivatives Not Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize petroleum and ethanol commodity contracts, foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts to hedge price and currency risk in certain commodity inventories and physical forward contracts.\nPetroleum and Ethanol Commodity Contracts\nWe use exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge price risk in certain commodity inventories which do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting or are not designated by us as fair value hedges. Additionally, we use exchange-traded derivative contracts, and occasionally financial forward and OTC swap agreements, to hedge commodity price exposure associated with our physical forward contracts which are not designated by us as cash flow hedges. These physical forward contracts, to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative, are considered OTC physical forwards and are reflected as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The related exchange-traded derivative contracts (and financial forward and OTC swaps, if applicable) are also reflected as brokerage margin deposits (and derivative assets or derivative liabilities, if applicable) in the consolidated balance sheet, thereby creating an economic hedge. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales. These exchange traded derivatives are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nWhile we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our commodity product purchase and sale activities, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily purchases and sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as other logistical issues inherent in our businesses, such as weather conditions. In connection with managing these positions, we are aided by maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace. We also engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of 250,000 barrels of commodity products at any one point in time. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales.\nMargin Deposits\nAll of our exchange-traded derivative contracts (designated and not designated) are transacted through clearing brokers. We deposit initial margin with the clearing brokers, along with variation margin, which is paid or received on a daily basis, based upon the changes in fair value of open futures contracts and settlement of closed futures contracts. Cash balances on deposit with clearing brokers and open equity are presented on a net basis within brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have concluded that our operating segments are also our reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Derecognized goodwill associated with our disposition activities of GDSO sites is included in the carrying value of assets sold in determining the gain or loss on disposal, to the extent the disposition of assets qualifies as a disposition of a business under ASC 805. The GDSO reporting unit's goodwill that was derecognized related to the disposition of sites that met the definition of a business was $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nDuring both 2018 and 2017, we completed a quantitative assessment for the GDSO reporting unit. Factors included in the assessment included both macro-economic conditions and industry specific conditions, and the fair value of the GDSO reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of a discounted cash flow approach and a market\ncomparables approach. Based on our assessment, no impairment was identified.\nIn 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nAccounting and reporting guidance for long-lived assets requires that a long-lived asset (group) be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Accordingly, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment are identified. If indicators of impairment are present, we assess impairment by comparing the undiscounted projected future cash flows from the long-lived assets to their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the long-lived assets will be reduced to their fair value.\nEnvironmental and Other Liabilities\nWe record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes.\nEstimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized when related contingencies are resolved, generally upon cash receipt.\nWe are subject to other contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters, including, environmental matters and contract and employment claims. Environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses previously owned. Further, due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations, there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Global Partners LP should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Global Partners LP and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nGeneral\nWe are a master limited partnership formed in March 2005. We own, control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products and renewable fuels in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (collectively, the Northeast\u201d). We are one of the region's largest independent owners, suppliers and operators of gasoline stations and convenience stores. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 1,579 owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, including 297 directly operated convenience stores, primarily in the Northeast. We are also one of the largest distributors of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in the New England states and New York. We engage in the purchasing, selling, gathering, blending, storing and logistics of transporting petroleum and related products, including gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (such as ethanol), distillates (such as home heating oil, diesel and kerosene), residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and in the transportation of petroleum products and renewable fuels by rail from the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada.\nCollectively, we sold approximately $12.3 billion of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we had other revenues of approximately $0.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from convenience store sales at our directly operated stores, rental income from dealer leased and commissioned agent leased gasoline stations and from cobranding arrangements, and sundries.\nWe base our pricing on spot prices, fixed prices or indexed prices and routinely use the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d) or other counterparties to hedge the risk inherent in buying and selling commodities. Through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives, we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations.\n2018 Events\nSeries A Preferred Unit Offering-On August 7, 2018, we issued 2,760,000 9.75% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d) for $25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933. We used the proceeds, net of underwriting discount and expenses, of $66.4 million to reduce indebtedness under our credit agreement. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Cheshire Oil Company, LLC-On July 24, 2018, we acquired the assets of ten company-operated gasoline stations and convenience stores from New Hampshire-based Cheshire Oil Company, LLC ( Cheshire\u201d) for approximately $33.4 million, including inventory. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Champlain Oil Company, Inc.-On July 17, 2018, we acquired retail fuel and convenience store assets from Vermont-based Champlain Oil Company, Inc. ( Champlain\u201d) for approximately $138.4 million, including inventory. The acquisition included 37 company-operated gasoline stations with Jiffy Mart-branded convenience stores in Vermont and New Hampshire and approximately 24 fuel sites that are either owned or leased, including lessee dealer and commission agent locations. The transaction also included fuel supply agreements for approximately 65 gasoline stations, primarily in Vermont and New Hampshire. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2017 Events\nAcquisition of Gasoline and Convenience Store Assets-On October 18, 2017, we completed the acquisition of retail gasoline and convenience store assets from Honey Farms, Inc. ( Honey Farms\u201d) in a cash transaction. The acquisition included 11 company-operated retail sites with gasoline and convenience stores and 22 company-operated stand-alone convenience stores. All of the sites are located in the greater Worcester, Massachusetts area. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSale of Natural Gas and Electricity Brokerage Businesses-On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses for a purchase price of approximately $17.3 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. Proceeds from the sale amounted to approximately $16.3 million, and we realized a gain on the sale of $14.2 million. Prior to the sale, the results of the natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses were included in the Commercial segment.\n2016 Events\nEarly Termination of Railcar Sublease-On December 21, 2016 (effective December 31, 2016), we voluntarily terminated early a sublease with a counterparty for 1,610 railcars that were underutilized due to unfavorable market conditions in the crude oil by rail market. Separately, we entered into a fleet management services agreement (effective January 1, 2017) with the counterparty, pursuant to which we provide railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services on behalf of the counterparty. As a result of the sublease termination, we recognized one-time discounted lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting of (i) $61.7 million cash consideration, (ii) $10.7 million of accrued incremental costs relating to our obligations under the sublease, and (iii) $8.3 million associated with derecognizing accumulated prepaid rent.\nThe $61.7 million cash consideration represents a discount of $10.2 million from $71.9 million in railcar lease payments that we would have been obligated to pay over the next three years. The termination of the sublease eliminated lease payments related to these railcars of approximately $30.0 million in 2017 and future lease payments of approximately $29.0 million and $13.0 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In addition to the discounted lease termination payment, the one-time expense includes costs for future railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services, as well as certain non-cash accounting adjustments associated with the early termination. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment-In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nSale of Gasoline Stations-On August 22, 2016, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., a subsidiary of ours, sold to Mirabito Holdings, Inc. 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in New York and Pennsylvania (the Drake Sites\u201d) for an aggregate total cash purchase price of approximately $40.0 million. In connection with closing, the parties entered into long-term supply contracts for branded and unbranded gasoline and other petroleum products.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction-On June 29, 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to these sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nExpanded Retail Network-In April 2016, we expanded our gasoline station and convenience-store network in Western Massachusetts with the addition of 22 leased retail sites ( 22 leased sites\u201d). Located in the Pittsfield and Springfield areas, these sites were added through long-term leases.\nOperating Segments\nWe purchase refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers, crude oil producers, major and independent oil companies and trading companies. We operate our businesses under three segments: (i) Wholesale, (ii) Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations ( GDSO\u201d) and (iii) Commercial.\nWholesale\nIn our Wholesale segment, we engage in the logistics of selling, gathering, blending, storing and transporting refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane. We transport these products by railcars, barges and/or pipelines pursuant to spot or long-term contracts. From time to time, we aggregate crude oil by truck or pipeline in the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada, transport it by rail and ship it by barge to refiners. We sell home heating oil, branded and unbranded gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and propane to home heating oil and propane retailers and wholesale distributors. Generally, customers use their own vehicles or contract carriers to take delivery of the gasoline, distillates and propane at bulk terminals and inland storage facilities that we own or control or at which we have throughput or exchange arrangements. Ethanol is shipped primarily by rail and by barge.\nIn our Wholesale segment, we obtain Renewable Identification Numbers ( RIN\u201d) in connection with our purchase of ethanol which is used for bulk trading purposes or for blending with gasoline through our terminal system. A RIN is a renewable identification number associated with government-mandated renewable fuel standards. To evidence that the required volume of renewable fuel is blended with gasoline, obligated parties must retire sufficient RINs to cover their Renewable Volume Obligation ( RVO\u201d). Our U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) obligations relative to renewable fuel reporting are comprised of foreign gasoline and diesel that we may import and blending operations at certain facilities.\nGasoline Distribution and Station Operations\nIn our GDSO segment, gasoline distribution includes sales of branded and unbranded gasoline to gasoline station operators and sub-jobbers. Station operations include (i) convenience stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers, from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sundries (such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions).\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, primarily in the Northeast, that consisted of the following:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompany operated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommissioned agents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLessee dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContract dealers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt our company-operated stores, we operate the gasoline stations and convenience stores with our employees, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station. At commissioned agent locations, we own the gasoline inventory, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station and pay the commissioned agent a fee related to the gallons sold. We receive rental income from commissioned agent leased gasoline stations for the leasing of the convenience store premises, repair bays and other businesses that may be conducted by the commissioned agent. At dealer-leased locations, the dealer purchases gasoline from us, and the dealer sets the retail price of gasoline at the dealer's station. We also receive rental income from (i) dealer-leased gasoline stations and (ii) cobranding arrangements. We also supply gasoline to locations owned and/or leased by independent contract dealers. Additionally, we have contractual relationships with distributors in certain New England states pursuant to which we source and supply these distributors' gasoline stations with ExxonMobil-branded gasoline.\nCommercial\nIn our Commercial segment, we include sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline, home heating oil, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and bunker fuel. In the case of public sector commercial and industrial end user customers, we sell products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms. We generally arrange for the delivery of the product to the customer's designated location, and we respond to publicly-issued requests for product proposals and quotes. Our Commercial segment also includes sales of custom blended fuels delivered by barges or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity.\nSeasonality\nDue to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline. Therefore, our volumes in gasoline are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. As demand for some of our refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally greater during the winter months, heating oil and residual oil volumes are generally higher during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. These factors may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nOutlook\nThis section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry-wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future, both in the short-term and in the long-term. Our results of operations and financial condition depend, in part, upon the following:\n \u00b7 Our businesses are influenced by the overall markets for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and increases and/or decreases in the prices of these products may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders and the amount of borrowing available for working capital under our credit agreement. Results from our purchasing, storing, terminalling, transporting, selling and blending operations are influenced by prices for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, price volatility and the market for such products. Prices in the overall markets for these products may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our margins can be significantly impacted by the forward product pricing curve, often referred to as the futures market. We typically hedge our exposure to petroleum product and renewable fuel price moves with futures contracts and, to a lesser extent, swaps. In markets where future prices are higher than current prices, referred to as contango, we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future. In markets where future prices are lower than current prices, referred to as backwardation, inventories can depreciate in value and hedging costs are more expensive. For this reason, in these backward markets, we attempt to reduce our inventories in order to minimize these effects. When prices for the products we sell rise, some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes, and their customers, in turn, may adopt conservation measures which reduce consumption, thereby reducing demand for product. Furthermore, when prices increase rapidly and dramatically, we may be unable to promptly pass our additional costs on to our customers, resulting in lower margins which could adversely affect our results of operations. Higher prices for the products we sell may (1) diminish our access to trade credit support and/or cause it to become more expensive and (2) decrease the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our credit agreement as a result of total available commitments, borrowing base limitations and advance rates thereunder. When prices for the products we sell decline, our exposure to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of our forward contracts may be increased as they and/or their customers may breach their contracts and purchase the products we sell at the then lower market price from a competitor. A significant decrease in \n the price for crude oil could adversely affect the economics of domestic crude oil production which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. A significant decrease in crude oil differentials could also have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. The prolonged decline in crude oil prices and crude oil differentials has indicated an impairment of our long-lived assets at our terminals in North Dakota. As a result of these events, we recognized a goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $149.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 We commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions and expending capital for growth projects, although there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or growth projects or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions or growth projects. We are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers and lessors of existing (or suitable for development) terminalling, storage, logistics and/or marketing assets, including gasoline stations, convenience stores and related businesses. Our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions and/or accretive development projects. We may be unable to execute such accretive transactions for a number of reasons, including the following: (1) we are unable to identify attractive transaction candidates or negotiate acceptable terms; (2) we are unable to obtain financing for such transactions on economically acceptable terms; or (3) we are outbid by competitors. In addition, we may consummate transactions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive but that ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events were to occur, our future growth and ability to increase or maintain distributions on our common units could be limited. We can give no assurance that our transaction efforts will be successful or that any such efforts will be completed on terms that are favorable to us. \n \u00b7 The condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity. In the past, world financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit. Possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in the availability of borrowings under our credit agreement, increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and our contractual counterparties requiring us to provide collateral. In addition, we could experience a tightening of trade credit from our suppliers. \n \u00b7 We depend upon marine, pipeline, rail and truck transportation services for a substantial portion of our logistics activities in transporting the products we sell. A disruption in these transportation services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Hurricanes, flooding and other severe weather conditions could cause a disruption in the transportation services we depend upon which could affect the flow of service. In addition, accidents, labor disputes between providers and their employees and labor renegotiations, including strikes, lockouts or a work stoppage, shortage of railcars, mechanical difficulties or bottlenecks and disruptions in transportation logistics could also disrupt our activities. These events could result in service disruptions and increased cost which could also adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Other disruptions, such as those due to an act of terrorism or war, could also adversely affect our businesses. \n \u00b7 We have contractual obligations for certain transportation assets such as railcars, barges and pipelines. A decline in demand for (i) the products we sell or (ii) our logistics activities, could result in a decrease in the utilization of our transportation assets, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. \n \u00b7 Our gasoline financial results, with particular impact to our GDSO segment, are seasonal and can be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline that we sell. Therefore, our results of operations in gasoline can be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. \n \u00b7 Our heating oil and residual oil financial results are seasonal and can be lower in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. Demand for some refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally higher during November through March than during April through October. We obtain a significant portion of these sales during the winter months. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters. \n \u00b7 Warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil. Because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the Northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters. \n \u00b7 Energy efficiency, higher prices, new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products. Higher prices and new technologies and alternative fuel sources, such as electric, hybrid or battery powered motor vehicles, could reduce the demand for transportation fuels and adversely impact our sales of transportation fuels. A reduction in sales of transportation fuels could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil. Consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades. We could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government-mandated controls or regulations further promoting the use of cleaner fuels. End users who are dual-fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas. Other end users may elect to convert to natural gas. During a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas, dual-fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas. During periods of increasing home heating oil prices relative to the price of natural gas, residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas. As described above, such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. \n \u00b7 Changes in government usage mandates and tax credits could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which could negatively impact our sales. The EPA has implemented a RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program seeks to promote the incorporation of biofuels in the nation's fuel supply and, to that end, sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the United States. A RIN is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the United States. We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RIN prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations related to the amount of RINs required and the total amounts that can be generated, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, and levels of transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline and ethanol, taking into consideration the EPA's regulations on the RFS program and oxygenate blending requirements. A reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate or oxygenate blending requirements could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which in turn could adversely affect our future gasoline and ethanol sales. In addition, changes in blending requirements or broadening the definition of what constitutes a renewable fuel could affect the price of RINs which could impact the magnitude of the mark-to-market liability recorded for the deficiency, if any, in our RIN position relative to our RVO at a point in time. \n \u00b7 We may not be able to fully implement or capitalize upon planned growth projects. We could have a number of organic growth projects that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital in the aggregate. Many of these projects involve numerous regulatory, environmental, commercial and legal uncertainties beyond our control. As these projects are undertaken, required approvals, permits and licenses may not be obtained, may be delayed or may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects. Moreover, revenues associated with these organic growth projects may not increase immediately upon the expenditures of funds with respect to a particular project and these projects may be completed behind schedule or in excess of budgeted cost. We may pursue and complete projects in anticipation of market demand that dissipates or market growth that never materializes. As a result of these uncertainties, the anticipated benefits associated with our capital projects may not be achieved. \n \u00b7 New, stricter environmental laws and other industry-related regulations or environmental litigation could significantly impact our operations and/or increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating, among other matters, logistics activities, product quality specifications and other environmental matters. The trend in environmental regulation has been towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. Risks related to our environmental permits, including the risk of noncompliance, permit interpretation, permit modification, renewal of permits on less favorable terms, judicial or administrative challenges to permits by citizens groups or federal, state or local entities or permit revocation are inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We may not be able to renew the permits necessary for our operations, or we may be forced to accept terms in future permits that limit our operations or result in additional compliance costs. In recent years, the transport of crude oil and ethanol has become subject to additional regulation. The establishment of more stringent design or construction standards, or other requirements for railroad tank cars that are used to transport crude oil and ethanol with too short of a timeframe for compliance may lead to shortages of compliant railcars available to transport crude oil and ethanol, which could adversely affect our businesses. Likewise, in recent years, efforts have commenced to seek to use federal, state and local laws to contest issuance of permits, contest renewal of permits and restrict the types of railroad tanks cars that can be used to deliver products, including, without limitation, crude oil and ethanol to bulk storage terminals. Were such laws to come into effect and were they to survive appeals and judicial review, they would potentially expose our operations to duplicative and possibly inconsistent regulation. There can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. In recent years environmental interest groups have filed suit against companies in the energy industry related to climate change. Should such suits succeed, we could face additional compliance costs or litigation risks. \nResults of Operations\nEvaluating Our Results of Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These measurements include: (1) product margin, (2) gross profit, (3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (4) distributable cash flow, (5) selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d), (6) operating expenses and (7) degree days.\nProduct Margin\nWe view product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. We review product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis. We define product margin as our product sales minus\nproduct costs. Product sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline, distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, as well as convenience store sales, gasoline station rental income and revenue generated from our logistics activities when we engage in the storage, transloading and shipment of products owned by others. Product costs primarily include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale as well as product costs related to convenience store items and costs associated with our logistics activities. We also look at product margin on a per unit basis (product margin divided by volume). Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements to assess our businesses. Product margin should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our product margin may not be comparable to product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies.\nGross Profit\nWe define gross profit as our product margin minus terminal and gasoline station related depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used as supplemental financial measures by management and may be used by external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess:\n \u00b7 our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements; \n \u00b7 our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis; \n \u00b7 our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; \n \u00b7 our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale, marketing, storing and distribution of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and in the gasoline stations and convenience stores business, without regard to financing methods and capital structure; and \n \u00b7 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities. \nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted for gains or losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nDistributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment. Distributable cash flow as defined by our partnership agreement is net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures, as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner that are extraordinary or non-recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow.\nDistributable cash flow as used in our partnership agreement also determines our ability to make cash distributions on our incentive distribution rights. The investment community also uses a distributable cash flow metric similar to the metric used in our partnership agreement with respect to publicly traded partnerships to indicate whether or not such partnerships have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain distributions on preferred or common units or support an increase in quarterly cash distributions on common units. Our partnership agreement does not permit adjustments for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges.\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses include, among other things, marketing costs, corporate overhead, employee salaries and benefits, pension and 401(k) plan expenses, discretionary bonuses, non-interest financing costs, professional fees and information technology expenses. Employee-related expenses including employee salaries, discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes, benefits, and pension and 401(k) plan expenses are paid by our general partner which, in turn, are reimbursed for these expenses by us.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals, transload facilities and gasoline stations and convenience stores used in our businesses. Lease payments, maintenance and repair, property taxes, utilities, credit card fees, taxes, labor and labor-related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. The majority of these expenses remains relatively stable, independent of the volumes through our system, but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nDegree Days\nA degree day\u201d is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of 65\u00b0F. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long-term (multi-year) average, or normal, to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service and officially archived by the National Climatic Data Center. For purposes of evaluating our results of operations, we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the National Weather Service at its Logan International Airport station in Boston, Massachusetts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following table provides a summary of some of the key performance indicators that may be used to assess our results of operations.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and a lease exit and termination gain of $3.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our December 2016 voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. Excluding these expenses, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $210.4 million for 2016. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these events. \n (3) Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d As defined by our partnership agreement, distributable cash flow is not adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. The table below presents reconciliations of distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n (4) Distributable cash flow includes a net loss on sale and disposition of assets of $5.9 million, $12.5 million and $20.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $114.1 million ($149.9 million, offset by $35.8 million attributed to the noncontrolling interest) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Distributable cash flow for 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the lease termination and impairment charges. Excluding the loss on sale and disposition of assets, impairment charges and lease exit and termination expenses, distributable cash flow would have been $180.0 million, $121.6 million and $93.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, distributable cash flow also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2017, distributable cash flow also includes a $14.2 million gain on the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n (5) Crude oil consists of our crude oil sales and revenue from our logistics activities. \n (6) Other oils and related products primarily consist of distillates, residual oil

</tr>\n</table>\n (1) Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d As defined by our partnership agreement, distributable cash flow is not adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. \n (2) Distributable cash flow includes a net loss on sale and disposition of assets of $5.9 million, $12.5 million and $20.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $114.1 million ($149.9 million, offset by $35.8 million attributed to the noncontrolling interest) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Distributable cash flow for 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the lease termination and impairment charges. Excluding the loss on sale and disposition of assets, impairment charges and lease exit and termination expenses, distributable cash flow would have been $180.0 million, $121.6 million and $93.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, distributable cash flow also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2017, distributable cash flow also includes a $14.2 million gain on the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n (3) Distributions to Series A preferred unitholders represent the distributions earned by the preferred unitholders during the period. Distributions on the Series A Preferred Units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2018. \nResults of Operations for Years 2018, 2017 and 2016\nConsolidated Sales\nOur total sales were $12.7 billion and $8.9 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $3.8 billion, or 42%, due to increases in prices and in volume sold. Our aggregate volume of product sold was 5.8 billion gallons and 4.7 billion gallons for 2018 and 2017, respectively an increase of 1.1 billion gallons. The increase in volume sold includes an increase of 930 million gallons in our Wholesale segment, reflecting an increase in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks offset by declines in volume sold in crude oil and distillates, and increases of 116 million gallons in our Commercial segment and 51 million gallons in our GDSO segment.\nOur total sales were $8.9 billion and $8.2 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 8%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in volume sold, primarily in our Wholesale segment. Our aggregate volume of product sold was 4.7 billion gallons and 5.1 billion gallons for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of 0.4 billion gallons. The decline in volume sold includes decreases of 364 million gallons in our Wholesale segment and 6 million gallons in our GDSO segment. We had an increase of 3 million gallons in our Commercial segment.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $650.4 million and $583.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $67.3 million, or 12%, primarily due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire in July 2018 and Honey Farms in October 2017 (collectively our Recent Acquisitions\u201d) and to higher fuel margins in our GDSO segment, largely in the fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable market conditions in our Wholesale segment, primarily in gasoline and distillates.\nOur gross profit was $583.1 million and $546.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $36.6 million, or 7%, primarily due to improved product margins in gasoline distribution in our GDSO segment and crude oil in our Wholesale segment. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by product margin declines in other oils and related products in our Wholesale segment due to less favorable market conditions and in station operations in our GDSO segment due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016.\nResults for Wholesale Segment\nGasoline and Gasoline Blendstocks. Sales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $4.7 billion and $2.1 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 126%, due to increases in prices and volume sold, primarily in gasoline. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $76.7 million and $82.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline, offset by improved margins in gasoline blendstocks, primarily ethanol, due to more favorable market conditions. Our product margin in 2017 benefited from weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017 that did not occur in 2018.\nSales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion, or 5%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $82.1 million and $83.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 2%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil sales and logistics revenues were $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 76%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude by rail differentials continued to be challenged. Our crude oil product margin was $7.2 million and $7.3 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, primarily due to lower contract revenue, partially offset by lower pipeline related expense, lower railcar lease and related expenses and lower terminal lease expense associated with the expiration of a terminal lease in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in\nrevenue recognized related to a take-or-pay contract with one particular customer compared to $21.6 million in revenue recognized in 2018 due to the expiration of that contract in June 2018. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility.\nCrude oil sales and logistics revenues were approximately $0.5 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $82.3 million, or 15%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude oil did not discount sufficiently to make rail transport to the East Coast competitive with imports. Our crude oil product margin was $7.3 million and negative $13.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $20.4 million, or 155%. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in revenue as compared to $28.0 million in 2016 related to the absence of logistics nominations from one particular contract customer, and a $34.4 million decrease in railcar lease expense to $11.3 million as a result of our early termination of a sublease in December 2016. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility and by less volume through our system.\nOther Oils and Related Products. Sales from other oils and related products (primarily distillates, residual oil and propane) were $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $323.5 million, or 19%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in distillate volume sold. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $53.4 million and $62.8 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in distillates in the first and third quarters of 2018, offset by improved margins in distillates in the fourth quarter. Our product margin in other oils and related products for both 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted due to warmer than normal temperatures.\nSales from other oils and related products were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $62.8 million and $74.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 15%. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted due to less favorable market conditions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017.\nResults for Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations Segment\nGasoline Distribution. Sales from gasoline distribution were $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in prices for most of 2018 and to an increase in volume sold due to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $373.3 million and $326.5 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $46.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher fuel margins as wholesale gasoline prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2018 and to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin for 2018 was negatively impacted by rising wholesale gasoline prices during the first six months of the year. Rising wholesale gasoline prices typically compress our gasoline product margin and declining wholesale gasoline prices typically improve our gasoline product margin, the extent of which depends on the magnitude and duration.\nSales from gasoline distribution were $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 10%, due to an increase in prices. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $326.5 million and $289.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $37.1 million, or 13%. The increase in our gasoline product margin was primarily due to declining wholesale gasoline prices during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nStation Operations. Our station operations, which include (i) convenience stores sales at our directly operated stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers or from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sale of sundries, such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions, collectively generated revenues of $0.4 billion for each of 2018 and 2017, increasing by $75.3 million, or 21%. Our product margin from station operations was $203.1 million and $175.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $28.1 million, or 16%. The increases in sales and product margin are primarily due to our Recent Acquisitions, partially offset by the\nsale of non-strategic sites.\nRevenues from our station operations, were $0.4 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $19.8 million, or 5%. Our product margin from station operations was $175.0 million and $183.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 5%. The decreases in sales and product margin in 2017 are primarily due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by the addition of leased company operated sites in April 2016 and the acquisition of Honey Farms in October 2017.\nResults for Commercial Segment\nOur commercial sales were $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $426.6 million, or 50%, due to increases in prices and in volume sold. Our commercial product margin was $23.6 million and $17.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $5.7 million, or 32%, primarily due to an increase in bunkering activity.\nOur commercial sales were $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing by $157.1 million, or 23%, primarily due to higher prices. Our commercial product margin was $17.9 million and $24.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 25%. The decreases in sales and product margin are primarily due to the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $171.0 million and $155.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $16.0 million, or 10%, including increases of $4.6 million in incentive compensation, $3.2 million in acquisition costs, $2.1 million in wages and benefits, $1.2 million in license fees, $1.1 million in depreciation, $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $2.9 million in various SG&A expenses. The increase in acquisitions costs consists of $3.9 million incurred in 2018 related to Champlain and Cheshire compared to $0.7 million incurred in 2017 related to Honey Farms.\nSG&A expenses were $155.0 million and $149.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $5.3 million, or 4%, including increases of $5.2 million in incentive compensation and $2.4 million in professional fees. In addition, during 2017, we incurred $1.1 million for certain costs in connection with a compensation funding agreement with our general partner (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in SG&A expenses was offset, in part, by decreases of $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $0.6 million in salaries and wages, as well as a decline of $1.9 million in severance charges incurred primarily in 2016 related to a reduction in our workforce.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $321.1 million and $283.6 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $37.5 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase of $35.5 million associated with our GDSO operations, due largely to our Recent Acquisitions and to increases in credit card fees, partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the sale of sites. Operating expenses associated with our terminal operations increased by $2.0 million.\nOperating expenses were $283.6 million and $288.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 2%. Operating expenses decreased by $2.6 million associated with our GDSO operations due, in part, to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by increases in credit card fees due to higher wholesale gasoline prices and in rent expense associated with the addition of leased sites, and the Honey Farms acquisition in October 2017. Operating expenses also decreased by $2.5 million at our Basin Transload facilities in North Dakota due to less activity. In addition, in 2016, we incurred $3.1 million in costs associated with cleaning tanks and related infrastructure at our Oregon facility in order to convert the facility to ethanol transloading. The decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase of $3.3 million associated with our terminal operations.\nGain (loss) on Trustee Taxes\nIn 2018, we recognized a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, which tax credit program expired in 2011. Based upon the significant passage of time from that 2011 expiration date, including underlying statutes of limitation, as of January 31, 2018 we determined that the liability was no longer required.\nIn 2017, we recognized a loss on trustee taxes of $16.2 million related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Trustee Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nLease Exit and Termination Gain (Expenses)\nIn 2018, we were released from certain of our obligations to provide railcar storage, freight, insurance and other services for railcars under a fleet management services agreement associated with our 2016 voluntary termination of a railcar sublease. The release of certain of those obligations resulted in a $3.5 million reduction of the remaining accrued incremental costs.\nIn 2016, the lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million represent a one-time discounted lease termination expense related to the early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars leased from a third party.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Leases\u201d for additional information.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense related to our intangible assets was $11.0 million, $9.2 million and $9.4 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases of $1.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the intangibles acquired in the Recent Acquisitions.\nNet (Loss) Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets\nWe had net losses on the sale and disposition of assets of ($5.9 million), ($12.5 million) and ($20.5 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the sale of GDSO sites. Included in the net loss on sale and disposition of assets is approximately $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of goodwill derecognized as part of the site divestitures. For 2017, we recorded a $14.2 million gain associated with the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nIn 2018 and 2017, we recognized a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, relating to long-lived assets used at certain gasoline stations and convenience stores associated with our GDSO segment. In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $89.1 million and $86.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of\n$2.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher average balances on our credit facilities for 2018, in part due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, an increase in inventory attributable to both volume and price, and an increase in interest rates for 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest expense was $86.2 million and $86.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, primarily due to lower average balances on our credit facilities and lower interest rates due to the May 2016 expiration of our interest rate swap, partially offset by a full year of our financing obligation recognized in connection with our sale-leaseback transaction entered into in June 2016.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIncome tax (expense) benefit was ($5.6 million), $23.6 million and ($0.1 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The income tax (expense) benefit recognized primarily reflects the income tax (expense) benefit from the operating results of GMG, which is a taxable entity for federal and state income tax purposes. The income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 ( the Act\u201d). As a result of the enactment of this law, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are anticipated to reverse in the future, resulting in a decrease to our net deferred tax liability of $22.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was recorded based on provisional amounts. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, including the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. There were no material adjustments to the provisional tax expense estimate that was previously recorded related to the Act. See Notes 2 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nIn February 2013, we acquired a 60% membership interest in Basin Transload. The net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $39.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represents the 40% noncontrolling ownership of the net loss reported. The noncontrolling interest for 2016 includes a $35.8 million goodwill and long-lived asset impairment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and distributions and to service our indebtedness. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, amounts available under our working capital revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Please read -Credit Agreement\u201d for more information on our working capital revolving credit facility.\nWorking capital was $292.2 million and $209.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $82.7 million, in part due to an increase of $35.7 million in inventories resulting from an increase in inventory volume and decreases of $67.7 million in trustee taxes payable and $23.4 million in the current portion of our working capital revolving credit facility which represents the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in trustee taxes payable was largely attributable to the $52.6 million extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and the settlement of a trustee tax loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in working capital was partially offset by a decrease of $82.5 million in accounts receivable, due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer in 2017.\nCash Distributions\nCommon Units\nDuring 2018, we paid the following cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDistribution Paid for the\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Distribution Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal Paid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQuarterly Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFebruary 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFourth quarter 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMay 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFirst quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAugust 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSecond quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNovember 14, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThird quarter 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, on January 28, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.50 per unit ($2.00 per unit on an annualized basis) on all of our outstanding common units for the period from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 to our common unitholders of record as of the close of business February 8, 2019. This distribution resulted in our reaching our second target level distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. On February 14, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $17.3 million.\nPreferred Units\nOn November 15, 2018, we paid a cash distribution to holders of the Series A Preferred Units in the total amount of $1.8 million covering the period from August 7, 2018 (the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Units) through November 14, 2018.\nIn addition, on January 22, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.609375 per unit ($2.4375 per unit on an annualized basis) on our Series A Preferred Units for the period from November 15, 2018 through February 14, 2019 to our preferred unitholders of record as of the opening of business on February 1, 2019. On February 15, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $1.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash.

Our credit agreement has a contractual maturity of April 30, 2020 and no principal payments are required prior to that date. However, we repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements. Therefore, the current portion of the working capital revolving credit facility included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year, and the long-term portion of the working capital revolving credit facility is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year. Please read -Credit Agreement\u201d for more information on our working capital revolving credit facility. \n (2) Includes principal and interest on our senior notes. No principal payments are required prior to maturity. The increase in 2022 is due to our 6.25% senior notes maturing in July 2022. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our senior notes. \n (3) Includes operating lease obligations related to leases for office space and computer equipment, land, terminals and throughputs, gasoline stations, railcars and barges. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (4) Includes amounts related to our 15-year brand fee agreement entered into in 2010 with ExxonMobil and amounts related to our pipeline connection agreements, our natural gas transportation and reservation agreements and our access right agreements (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements) and pension and deferred compensation obligations. \n (5) Includes lease rental payments in connection with (i) the acquisition of Capitol related to properties previously sold by Capitol within two sale-leaseback transactions; and (ii) the sale of real property assets at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores. These transactions did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and the lease rental payments are classified as interest expense on the respective financing obligation and the pay-down of the related financing obligation. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information. \nSee Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to purchase commitments and sublease information related to certain lease agreements.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade and enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. We categorize our capital requirements as either maintenance capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to repair or replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of, or revenues generated by, existing assets and extend their useful lives. Maintenance capital expenditures also include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tank and pipeline integrity and safety and to address certain environmental regulations. We anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by operations. We had approximately $38.6 million, $34.7 million and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, of which approximately $33.6 million, $27.9 million and $25.7 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are related to our investments in our gasoline stations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\nExpansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets to grow our businesses or expand our existing facilities, such as projects that increase our operating capacity or revenues by, for example, increasing dock capacity and tankage, diversifying product availability, investing in raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry gasoline stations and convenience stores, increasing storage flexibility at various terminals and by adding terminals to our storage network. We have the ability to fund our expansion capital expenditures through cash from operations or our credit agreement or by issuing debt securities or additional equity. We had approximately $175.7 million, $29.2 million and $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures, including acquisitions, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2018, the $175.7 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $145.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisitions of Cheshire and Champlain. In addition, we had $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to investments in our gasoline stations, including, in part, raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry sites.\nIn 2017, the $29.2 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $14.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisition of Honey Farms. In addition, we had $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures which consists of $8.7 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and $6.4 million in other expansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nIn 2016, the $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately (i) $25.4 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and includes $5.7 million related to the addition of 22 leased sites in April 2016; (ii) $7.9 million in costs associated with our terminal assets, including $7.5 million in dock and infrastructure expansion at our Oregon facility, and (iii) $5.0 million in other\nexpansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nWe currently expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million and expansion capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million in 2019, relating primarily to investments in our gasoline station business. These current estimates depend, in part, on the timing of completion of projects, availability of equipment, weather and unanticipated events or opportunities requiring additional maintenance or investments.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and the ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n168,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n348,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(119,886)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(225,720)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(61,644)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n50,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(281,968)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n122,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities generally reflects our net income, balance sheet changes arising from inventory purchasing patterns, the timing of collections on our accounts receivable, the seasonality of parts of our businesses, fluctuations in product prices, working capital requirements and general market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.9 million and $348.4 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a year-over-year decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $179.5 million. For 2018, cash flow from operating activities was not impacted by the non-cash gain of $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. This gain was included in net income and offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability which had historically been included in trustee taxes (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $348.4 million for 2017 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $119.9 million for 2016, for a year-over-year increase in cash flows from operating activities of $468.3 million.\nThe primary drivers of the changes in operating activities include the following (in thousands):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecrease (increase) in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n81,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n78,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(110,237)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n114,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Increase) decrease in inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(29,778)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n173,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(202,945)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n173,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(135,888)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n309,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Decrease) increase in accounts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,433)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,850)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(24,260)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2018, the decrease in accounts receivable was due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer at December 31, 2017 that was not recognized at December 31, 2018. The increase in inventories was due to higher inventory volume. The decrease in operating cash flow was also impacted by the year-over-year change in derivatives of $34.1 million due to market direction and in trustee taxes of $24.2 million. The change in trustee taxes in 2017 includes the $16.2 million payment related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nIn 2017, the decrease in inventories is due to reduced inventory volume, in part due to a change in market structure and to lower crude oil volume as compared to an increase in inventories in 2016 primarily due to higher prices. Accounts receivable decreased slightly in 2017 as compared to a $110.2 million increase in 2016 which was primarily due to higher prices and an increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer. The increase in cash flows from operating activities also reflects the period over period increase in net income which in part reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses incurred in 2016.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to higher prices. An increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable. The $182.4 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities also reflects the decrease in net income which, in part, reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses and the decline in crude oil product margin due to tight rail differentials. The change in derivatives year over year provided funds of $49.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $225.7 million for 2018 and included $138.2 million and $33.4 million in cash used to fund the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, respectively, including inventory, $38.6 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures and $3.3 million in seller note issuances, offset by $18.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. The seller note issuances represent notes we received from buyers in connection with the sale of certain of our gasoline stations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $61.6 million for 2017 and included $38.5 million in cash to fund the acquisition of Honey Farms, including inventory, $34.7 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures and $6.0 million in seller note issuances, offset by $32.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment ($16.3 million from the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses, less $0.5 million in related transaction costs, and $16.9 million primarily from the sales of GDSO sites).\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $6.4 million for 2016 and included $77.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily associated with the sale of the Drake Sites, the periodic divestiture of gasoline stations and the strategic asset divestiture program, offset by $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures.\nPlease read -Capital Expenditures\u201d for a discussion of our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $50.1 million for 2018 and included $66.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, $26.6 million in net borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $24.0 million in borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, offset by $66.0 million in cash distributions to our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) and our general partner and $0.8 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2018.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $282.0 million for 2017 and included $197.9 million in net payments on our working capital revolving credit facility, due in part to reduced inventory volume which was partially due to a change in market structure, $62.7 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner, $20.7 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility, $0.5 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2017 and $0.5 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload, offset by $0.3 million in capital contributions from our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $122.4 million for 2016 and included $176.5 million in net borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, primarily due to an increase in prices, and $62.5 million in net proceeds from our sale-leaseback transaction, offset by $62.5 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders\nand our general partner, $52.3 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility representing proceeds from asset sales which was partially offset by $61.7 million in borrowings in connection with our railcar sublease termination, and $1.8 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nSee Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for supplemental cash flow information related to our working capital revolving credit facility and revolving credit facility for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCredit Agreement\nCertain subsidiaries of ours, as borrowers, and we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, have a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility. We repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements and, therefore, classify as a current liability the portion of the working capital revolving credit facility we expect to pay down during the course of the year. The long-term portion of the working capital revolving credit facility is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year. The credit agreement matures on April 30, 2020.\nThere are two facilities under the credit agreement:\n \u00b7 a working capital revolving credit facility to be used for working capital purposes and letters of credit in the principal amount equal to the lesser of our borrowing base and $850.0 million; and \n \u00b7 a $450.0 million revolving credit facility to be used for acquisitions, joint ventures, capital expenditures, letters of credit and general corporate purposes. \nIn addition, the credit agreement has an accordion feature whereby we may request on the same terms and conditions then applicable to the credit agreement, provided no Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) then exists, an increase to the working capital revolving credit facility, the revolving credit facility, or both, by up to another $300.0 million, in the aggregate, for a total credit facility of up to $1.6 billion. Any such request for an increase must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our lending group will agree to fund any request by us for additional amounts in excess of the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nIn addition, the credit agreement includes a swing line pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A., as the swing line lender, may make swing line loans in U.S. dollars in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (a) $75.0 million and (b) the Aggregate WC Commitments (as defined in the credit agreement). Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined in the credit agreement). The swing line is a sub-portion of the working capital revolving credit facility and is not an addition to the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nAvailability under the working capital revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which is redetermined from time to time and based on specific advance rates on eligible current assets. Under the credit agreement, borrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility cannot exceed the then current borrowing base. Availability under the borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, such as changes in petroleum product prices, collection cycles, counterparty performance, advance rates and limits and general economic conditions. These and other events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We can provide no assurance that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nBorrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 1.50%, each depending on the Utilization Amount (as defined in the credit agreement). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 2.00%, each depending on the Combined Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\nThe average interest rates for the credit agreement were 4.0%, 3.7% and 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe credit agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the then applicable working capital rate or then applicable revolver rate (each such rate as defined in the credit agreement) per annum for each letter of credit issued. In addition, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of each facility under the credit agreement, ranging from 0.35% to 0.50% per annum.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of $473.3 million, including $220.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit of $56.0 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, the total remaining availability for borrowings and letters of credit was $770.7 million and $810.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries and is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries, Bursaw Oil LLC, Global Partners Energy Canada ULC, Warex Terminals Corporation, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., Puritan Oil Company, Inc. and Maryland Oil Company, Inc.\nThe credit agreement also includes (i) a $25.0 million general secured indebtedness basket, (ii) a $25.0 million general investment basket, (iii) a $75.0 million secured indebtedness basket to permit the borrowers to enter into a Contango Facility (as defined in the credit agreement), (iv) a Sale/Leaseback Transaction (as defined in the credit agreement) basket of $100.0 million, and (v) a basket of $50.0 million in an aggregate amount over the life of the credit agreement for the purchase of our common units, provided that no Event of Default exists or would occur immediately following such purchase(s).\nIn addition, the credit agreement provides the ability for the borrowers to repay certain junior indebtedness, subject to a $100.0 million cap, so long as no Event of Default has occurred or will exist immediately after making such repayment.\nThe credit agreement imposes financial covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum working capital amounts, a minimum combined interest coverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with the foregoing covenants at December 31, 2018. The credit agreement also contains a representation whereby there can be no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the credit agreement). In addition, the credit agreement limits distributions by us to our unitholders to the amount of Available Cash (as defined in the partnership agreement).\n6.25% Senior Notes\nOn June 19, 2014, we and GLP Finance Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 6.25% senior notes due 2022 (the 6.25% Notes\u201d) to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The 6.25% Notes were resold by the Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 6.25% Notes on June 24, 2014, the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the Indenture\u201d).\nThe 6.25% Notes mature on July 15, 2022 with interest accruing at a rate of 6.25% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2015. The 6.25% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent\nset forth in the Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 6.25% Notes may declare the 6.25% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 6.25% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 6.25% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 103.125% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2018, 101.563% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2019, and 100.0% beginning on July 15, 2020 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 6.25% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the Indenture.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 6.25% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $15.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $15.0 million.\n7.00% Senior Notes\nOn June 1, 2015, the Issuers entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 7.00% senior notes due 2023 (the 7.00% Notes\u201d) to the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 7.00% Notes were resold by the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 7.00% Notes on June 4, 2015 the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the 7.00% Notes Indenture\u201d).\nThe 7.00% Notes will mature on June 15, 2023 with interest accruing at a rate of 7.00% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2015. The 7.00% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent set forth in the 7.00% Notes Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 7.00% Notes may declare the 7.00% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 7.00% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 7.00% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 105.250% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2018, 103.500% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2019, 101.750% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2020, and 100.0% beginning June 15, 2021 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the 7.00% Notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 7.00% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the 7.00% Notes Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the 7.00% Notes Indenture.\nThe 7.00% Notes Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the 7.00% Notes Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 7.00% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the 7.00% Notes Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $50.0 million.\nFinancing Obligations\nCapitol Acquisition\nOn June 1, 2015, we acquired retail gasoline stations and dealer supply contracts from Capitol Petroleum Group ( Capitol\u201d). In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a financing obligation of $89.6 million associated with two sale-leaseback transactions by Capitol for 53 leased sites that did not meet the criteria for sale accounting. During the terms of these leases, which expire in May 2028 and September 2029, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense of approximately $9.4 million, $9.6 million and $9.6 million was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The financing obligation will amortize through expiration of the leases based upon the lease rental payments which were $9.7 million, $9.7 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $87.5 million associated with the Capitol acquisition.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction\nOn June 29, 2016, we sold to a premier institutional real estate investor (the Buyer\u201d) real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island (the Sale-Leaseback Sites\u201d) for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a Master Unitary Lease Agreement with the Buyer to lease back the real property assets sold with respect to the Sale-Leaseback Sites (such Master Lease Agreement, together with the Sale-Leaseback Sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction\u201d). The Master Unitary Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of fifteen years that expires in 2031. We have one successive option to renew the lease for a ten-year period followed by two successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods on the same terms, covenants, conditions and rental as the primary non-revocable lease term. We do not have any residual interest nor the option to repurchase any of the sites at the end of the lease term. The proceeds from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nThe sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting as of December 31, 2018 due to prohibited continuing involvement. Specifically, the sale is considered a partial-sale transaction, which is a form of continuing involvement as we did not transfer to the Buyer the storage tank systems which are considered integral equipment of the Sale-Leaseback Sites. Additionally, a portion of the sold sites have material sub-lease arrangements, which is also a form of continuing involvement. As the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites did not meet the criteria for sale accounting, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a result of not meeting the criteria for sale accounting for these sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement. As such, the property and equipment sold and leased back by us has not been derecognized and continues to be depreciated. We recognized a corresponding financing obligation of $62.5 million equal to the $63.5 million cash proceeds received for the sale of these sites, net of $1.0 million financing fees. During the term of the lease, which expires in June 2031, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Lease rental payments are recognized as both interest expense and a reduction of the principal balance associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense was $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and lease rental payments were $4.5 million, $4.5 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,\nrespectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $62.5 million associated with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur businesses of supplying refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and other business activities, involves a number of activities that are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws. For a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our businesses, please read Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties-Environmental.\u201d For additional information regarding our environmental liabilities, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and are recorded in the period in which they become known. We have identified the following estimates that, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis:\nInventory\nWe hedge substantially all of our petroleum and ethanol inventory using a variety of instruments, primarily exchange-traded futures contracts. These futures contracts are entered into when inventory is purchased and are either designated as fair value hedges against the inventory on a specific barrel basis for inventories qualifying for fair value hedge accounting or not designated and maintained as economic hedges against certain inventory of ours on a specific barrel basis. Changes in fair value of these futures contracts, as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged inventory, are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales. All hedged inventory designated in a fair value hedge relationship is valued using the lower of cost, as determined by specific identification, or net realizable value, as determined at the product level. All petroleum and ethanol inventory not designated in a fair value hedging relationship is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. RIN inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Convenience store inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, based on a weighted average cost method, or net realizable value.\nIn addition to our own inventory, we have exchange agreements for petroleum products and ethanol with unrelated third-party suppliers, whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and suppliers may draw inventory from us. Positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable. Negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable. Exchange transactions are valued using current carrying costs.\nLeases\nWe have terminal and throughput lease arrangements with various other oil terminals and third parties, certain of which arrangements have minimum usage requirements. In addition, we lease certain gasoline stations from third\nparties under long-term arrangements with various expiration dates. We also have several long-term lease agreements with Getty Realty, which enables us to supply and operate certain Getty Realty gasoline station sites, and with the Port of Columbia County (formerly known as Port of St. Helens) in Clatskanie, Oregon for land and for access rights to a rail spur and dock located at our Oregon facility.\nWe have future commitments, principally for office space and computer equipment, under the terms of operating lease arrangements. We also lease railcars and barges through various lease arrangements with various expiration dates. We have rental income from gasoline stations and cobranding arrangements and lease income from space leased to several unrelated third parties at several of our terminals.\nIn addition, in June of 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores. In connection with this sale-leaseback transaction, we are party to a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to such sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting and reporting guidance for leases requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. The lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. Lease rental expense and income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nWe will be adopting ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and do not expect this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations. However, we estimate approximately $0.3 billion of right-of-use assets and liabilities will be recognized upon adoption on our consolidated balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery, net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. We may also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales.\nContracts with customers typically contain pricing provisions that are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on quality and freight due to location differences and prevailing supply and demand conditions, as well as other factors. As a result, the price of the products fluctuates to remain competitive with other available product supplies. The revenue associated with such arrangements is recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from our logistics activities when we store, transload and ship products owned by others. Revenue from logistics services is recognized as services are provided.\nLogistics agreements may require counterparties to throughput a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period and may include make-up rights if the minimum volume is not met. We recognize revenue associated with make-up rights at the earlier of when the make-up volume is shipped, the make-up right expires or when it is determined that the likelihood that the shipper will utilize the make-up right is remote.\nWe also recognize convenience store sales of gasoline, grocery and other merchandise and sundries at the time of the sale to the customer. Gasoline station rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nProduct revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements, which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels and crude oil of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets. We recognize net exchange differentials due from exchange partners in sales upon delivery of product to an exchange partner. We recognize net exchange differentials due to exchange partners in cost of sales upon receipt of product from an exchange partner.\nThe amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTrustee Taxes\nWe collect trustee taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities, and remit such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. Examples of trustee taxes include, among other things, motor fuel excise tax and sales and use tax. As such, it is our policy to exclude trustee taxes from revenues and cost of sales and account for them as current liabilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may be subject to audits of our state and federal tax returns prepared for trustee taxes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe principally use derivative instruments, which include regulated exchange-traded futures and options contracts (collectively, exchange-traded derivatives\u201d) and physical and financial forwards and over-the counter ( OTC\u201d) swaps (collectively, OTC derivatives\u201d), to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity market prices and interest rates. We use these exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to hedge commodity price risk associated with our inventory and undelivered forward commodity purchases and sales ( physical forward contracts\u201d). We account for derivative transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and recognize derivatives instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions are presented currently in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to our brokers upon liquidation of these contracts. The fair value of these exchange-traded derivative transactions is presented on a net basis, offset by the cash balances on deposit with our brokers, presented as brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of OTC derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party upon liquidation of these contracts under current market conditions. The fair value of these OTC derivative transactions is presented on a gross basis as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, unless a legal right of offset exists. The presentation of the change in fair value of our exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivative transactions depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nDerivatives Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to hedge commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nFair Value Hedges\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to hedge price risk in commodity inventories and principally include exchange-traded futures contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item of the risk being hedged. Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operation through cost of sales. These futures contracts are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nOur fair value hedges include exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC derivative contracts that are hedges against inventory with specific futures contracts matched to specific barrels. The change in fair value of these futures contracts and the change in fair value of the underlying inventory generally provide an offset to each other in the consolidated statement of operations.\nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge interest rate risk from fluctuations in interest rates and may include various interest rate derivative instruments entered into with major financial institutions. For a\nderivative instrument being designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations through interest expense in the same period that the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations immediately.\nDerivatives Not Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize petroleum and ethanol commodity contracts, foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts to hedge price and currency risk in certain commodity inventories and physical forward contracts.\nPetroleum and Ethanol Commodity Contracts\nWe use exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge price risk in certain commodity inventories which do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting or are not designated by us as fair value hedges. Additionally, we use exchange-traded derivative contracts, and occasionally financial forward and OTC swap agreements, to hedge commodity price exposure associated with our physical forward contracts which are not designated by us as cash flow hedges. These physical forward contracts, to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative, are considered OTC physical forwards and are reflected as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The related exchange-traded derivative contracts (and financial forward and OTC swaps, if applicable) are also reflected as brokerage margin deposits (and derivative assets or derivative liabilities, if applicable) in the consolidated balance sheet, thereby creating an economic hedge. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales. These exchange traded derivatives are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nWhile we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our commodity product purchase and sale activities, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily purchases and sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as other logistical issues inherent in our businesses, such as weather conditions. In connection with managing these positions, we are aided by maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace. We also engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of 250,000 barrels of commodity products at any one point in time. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales.\nMargin Deposits\nAll of our exchange-traded derivative contracts (designated and not designated) are transacted through clearing brokers. We deposit initial margin with the clearing brokers, along with variation margin, which is paid or received on a daily basis, based upon the changes in fair value of open futures contracts and settlement of closed futures contracts. Cash balances on deposit with clearing brokers and open equity are presented on a net basis within brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have concluded that our operating segments are also our reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Derecognized goodwill associated with our disposition activities of GDSO sites is included in the carrying value of assets sold in determining the gain or loss on disposal, to the extent the disposition of assets qualifies as a disposition of a business under ASC 805. The GDSO reporting unit's goodwill that was derecognized related to the disposition of sites that met the definition of a business was $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nDuring both 2018 and 2017, we completed a quantitative assessment for the GDSO reporting unit. Factors included in the assessment included both macro-economic conditions and industry specific conditions, and the fair value of the GDSO reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of a discounted cash flow approach and a market\ncomparables approach. Based on our assessment, no impairment was identified.\nIn 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nAccounting and reporting guidance for long-lived assets requires that a long-lived asset (group) be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Accordingly, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment are identified. If indicators of impairment are present, we assess impairment by comparing the undiscounted projected future cash flows from the long-lived assets to their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the long-lived assets will be reduced to their fair value.\nEnvironmental and Other Liabilities\nWe record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes.\nEstimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized when related contingencies are resolved, generally upon cash receipt.\nWe are subject to other contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters, including, environmental matters and contract and employment claims. Environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses previously owned. Further, due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations, there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Global Partners LP should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Global Partners LP and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nGeneral\nWe are a master limited partnership formed in March 2005. We own, control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products and renewable fuels in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (collectively, the Northeast\u201d). We are one of the region's largest independent owners, suppliers and operators of gasoline stations and convenience stores. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 1,579 owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, including 297 directly operated convenience stores, primarily in the Northeast. We are also one of the largest distributors of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in the New England states and New York. We engage in the purchasing, selling, gathering, blending, storing and logistics of transporting petroleum and related products, including gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (such as ethanol), distillates (such as home heating oil, diesel and kerosene), residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and in the transportation of petroleum products and renewable fuels by rail from the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada.\nCollectively, we sold approximately $12.3 billion of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we had other revenues of approximately $0.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 from convenience store sales at our directly operated stores, rental income from dealer leased and commissioned agent leased gasoline stations and from cobranding arrangements, and sundries.\nWe base our pricing on spot prices, fixed prices or indexed prices and routinely use the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d), Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) and Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE\u201d) or other counterparties to hedge the risk inherent in buying and selling commodities. Through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives, we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations.\n2018 Events\nSeries A Preferred Unit Offering-On August 7, 2018, we issued 2,760,000 9.75% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d) for $25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933. We used the proceeds, net of underwriting discount and expenses, of $66.4 million to reduce indebtedness under our credit agreement. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Cheshire Oil Company, LLC-On July 24, 2018, we acquired the assets of ten company-operated gasoline stations and convenience stores from New Hampshire-based Cheshire Oil Company, LLC ( Cheshire\u201d) for approximately $33.4 million, including inventory. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAcquisition from Champlain Oil Company, Inc.-On July 17, 2018, we acquired retail fuel and convenience store assets from Vermont-based Champlain Oil Company, Inc. ( Champlain\u201d) for approximately $138.4 million, including inventory. The acquisition included 37 company-operated gasoline stations with Jiffy Mart-branded convenience stores in Vermont and New Hampshire and approximately 24 fuel sites that are either owned or leased, including lessee dealer and commission agent locations. The transaction also included fuel supply agreements for approximately 65 gasoline stations, primarily in Vermont and New Hampshire. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2017 Events\nAcquisition of Gasoline and Convenience Store Assets-On October 18, 2017, we completed the acquisition of retail gasoline and convenience store assets from Honey Farms, Inc. ( Honey Farms\u201d) in a cash transaction. The acquisition included 11 company-operated retail sites with gasoline and convenience stores and 22 company-operated stand-alone convenience stores. All of the sites are located in the greater Worcester, Massachusetts area. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSale of Natural Gas and Electricity Brokerage Businesses-On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses for a purchase price of approximately $17.3 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. Proceeds from the sale amounted to approximately $16.3 million, and we realized a gain on the sale of $14.2 million. Prior to the sale, the results of the natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses were included in the Commercial segment.\n2016 Events\nEarly Termination of Railcar Sublease-On December 21, 2016 (effective December 31, 2016), we voluntarily terminated early a sublease with a counterparty for 1,610 railcars that were underutilized due to unfavorable market conditions in the crude oil by rail market. Separately, we entered into a fleet management services agreement (effective January 1, 2017) with the counterparty, pursuant to which we provide railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services on behalf of the counterparty. As a result of the sublease termination, we recognized one-time discounted lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 consisting of (i) $61.7 million cash consideration, (ii) $10.7 million of accrued incremental costs relating to our obligations under the sublease, and (iii) $8.3 million associated with derecognizing accumulated prepaid rent.\nThe $61.7 million cash consideration represents a discount of $10.2 million from $71.9 million in railcar lease payments that we would have been obligated to pay over the next three years. The termination of the sublease eliminated lease payments related to these railcars of approximately $30.0 million in 2017 and future lease payments of approximately $29.0 million and $13.0 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In addition to the discounted lease termination payment, the one-time expense includes costs for future railcar storage, freight, cleaning, insurance and other services, as well as certain non-cash accounting adjustments associated with the early termination. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment-In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nSale of Gasoline Stations-On August 22, 2016, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., a subsidiary of ours, sold to Mirabito Holdings, Inc. 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in New York and Pennsylvania (the Drake Sites\u201d) for an aggregate total cash purchase price of approximately $40.0 million. In connection with closing, the parties entered into long-term supply contracts for branded and unbranded gasoline and other petroleum products.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction-On June 29, 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to these sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nExpanded Retail Network-In April 2016, we expanded our gasoline station and convenience-store network in Western Massachusetts with the addition of 22 leased retail sites ( 22 leased sites\u201d). Located in the Pittsfield and Springfield areas, these sites were added through long-term leases.\nOperating Segments\nWe purchase refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers, crude oil producers, major and independent oil companies and trading companies. We operate our businesses under three segments: (i) Wholesale, (ii) Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations ( GDSO\u201d) and (iii) Commercial.\nWholesale\nIn our Wholesale segment, we engage in the logistics of selling, gathering, blending, storing and transporting refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane. We transport these products by railcars, barges and/or pipelines pursuant to spot or long-term contracts. From time to time, we aggregate crude oil by truck or pipeline in the mid-continent region of the United States and Canada, transport it by rail and ship it by barge to refiners. We sell home heating oil, branded and unbranded gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and propane to home heating oil and propane retailers and wholesale distributors. Generally, customers use their own vehicles or contract carriers to take delivery of the gasoline, distillates and propane at bulk terminals and inland storage facilities that we own or control or at which we have throughput or exchange arrangements. Ethanol is shipped primarily by rail and by barge.\nIn our Wholesale segment, we obtain Renewable Identification Numbers ( RIN\u201d) in connection with our purchase of ethanol which is used for bulk trading purposes or for blending with gasoline through our terminal system. A RIN is a renewable identification number associated with government-mandated renewable fuel standards. To evidence that the required volume of renewable fuel is blended with gasoline, obligated parties must retire sufficient RINs to cover their Renewable Volume Obligation ( RVO\u201d). Our U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA\u201d) obligations relative to renewable fuel reporting are comprised of foreign gasoline and diesel that we may import and blending operations at certain facilities.\nGasoline Distribution and Station Operations\nIn our GDSO segment, gasoline distribution includes sales of branded and unbranded gasoline to gasoline station operators and sub-jobbers. Station operations include (i) convenience stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers, from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sundries (such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions).\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, primarily in the Northeast, that consisted of the following:\n\nAt our company-operated stores, we operate the gasoline stations and convenience stores with our employees, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station. At commissioned agent locations, we own the gasoline inventory, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station and pay the commissioned agent a fee related to the gallons sold. We receive rental income from commissioned agent leased gasoline stations for the leasing of the convenience store premises, repair bays and other businesses that may be conducted by the commissioned agent. At dealer-leased locations, the dealer purchases gasoline from us, and the dealer sets the retail price of gasoline at the dealer's station. We also receive rental income from (i) dealer-leased gasoline stations and (ii) cobranding arrangements. We also supply gasoline to locations owned and/or leased by independent contract dealers. Additionally, we have contractual relationships with distributors in certain New England states pursuant to which we source and supply these distributors' gasoline stations with ExxonMobil-branded gasoline.\nCommercial\nIn our Commercial segment, we include sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline, home heating oil, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and bunker fuel. In the case of public sector commercial and industrial end user customers, we sell products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms. We generally arrange for the delivery of the product to the customer's designated location, and we respond to publicly-issued requests for product proposals and quotes. Our Commercial segment also includes sales of custom blended fuels delivered by barges or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity.\nSeasonality\nDue to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline. Therefore, our volumes in gasoline are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. As demand for some of our refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally greater during the winter months, heating oil and residual oil volumes are generally higher during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. These factors may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nOutlook\nThis section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry-wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future, both in the short-term and in the long-term. Our results of operations and financial condition depend, in part, upon the following:\n \u00b7 Our businesses are influenced by the overall markets for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and increases and/or decreases in the prices of these products may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders and the amount of borrowing available for working capital under our credit agreement. Results from our purchasing, storing, terminalling, transporting, selling and blending operations are influenced by prices for refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, price volatility and the market for such products. Prices in the overall markets for these products may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our margins can be significantly impacted by the forward product pricing curve, often referred to as the futures market. We typically hedge our exposure to petroleum product and renewable fuel price moves with futures contracts and, to a lesser extent, swaps. In markets where future prices are higher than current prices, referred to as contango, we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future. In markets where future prices are lower than current prices, referred to as backwardation, inventories can depreciate in value and hedging costs are more expensive. For this reason, in these backward markets, we attempt to reduce our inventories in order to minimize these effects. When prices for the products we sell rise, some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes, and their customers, in turn, may adopt conservation measures which reduce consumption, thereby reducing demand for product. Furthermore, when prices increase rapidly and dramatically, we may be unable to promptly pass our additional costs on to our customers, resulting in lower margins which could adversely affect our results of operations. Higher prices for the products we sell may (1) diminish our access to trade credit support and/or cause it to become more expensive and (2) decrease the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our credit agreement as a result of total available commitments, borrowing base limitations and advance rates thereunder. When prices for the products we sell decline, our exposure to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of our forward contracts may be increased as they and/or their customers may breach their contracts and purchase the products we sell at the then lower market price from a competitor. A significant decrease in \n the price for crude oil could adversely affect the economics of domestic crude oil production which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. A significant decrease in crude oil differentials could also have an adverse effect on our crude oil logistics activities and sales. The prolonged decline in crude oil prices and crude oil differentials has indicated an impairment of our long-lived assets at our terminals in North Dakota. As a result of these events, we recognized a goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $149.9 million for year ended December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 We commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions and expending capital for growth projects, although there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or growth projects or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions or growth projects. We are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers and lessors of existing (or suitable for development) terminalling, storage, logistics and/or marketing assets, including gasoline stations, convenience stores and related businesses. Our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions and/or accretive development projects. We may be unable to execute such accretive transactions for a number of reasons, including the following: (1) we are unable to identify attractive transaction candidates or negotiate acceptable terms; (2) we are unable to obtain financing for such transactions on economically acceptable terms; or (3) we are outbid by competitors. In addition, we may consummate transactions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive but that ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events were to occur, our future growth and ability to increase or maintain distributions on our common units could be limited. We can give no assurance that our transaction efforts will be successful or that any such efforts will be completed on terms that are favorable to us. \n \u00b7 The condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity. In the past, world financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit. Possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in the availability of borrowings under our credit agreement, increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and our contractual counterparties requiring us to provide collateral. In addition, we could experience a tightening of trade credit from our suppliers. \n \u00b7 We depend upon marine, pipeline, rail and truck transportation services for a substantial portion of our logistics activities in transporting the products we sell. A disruption in these transportation services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Hurricanes, flooding and other severe weather conditions could cause a disruption in the transportation services we depend upon which could affect the flow of service. In addition, accidents, labor disputes between providers and their employees and labor renegotiations, including strikes, lockouts or a work stoppage, shortage of railcars, mechanical difficulties or bottlenecks and disruptions in transportation logistics could also disrupt our activities. These events could result in service disruptions and increased cost which could also adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Other disruptions, such as those due to an act of terrorism or war, could also adversely affect our businesses. \n \u00b7 We have contractual obligations for certain transportation assets such as railcars, barges and pipelines. A decline in demand for (i) the products we sell or (ii) our logistics activities, could result in a decrease in the utilization of our transportation assets, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. \n \u00b7 Our gasoline financial results, with particular impact to our GDSO segment, are seasonal and can be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the nature of our businesses and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline that we sell. Therefore, our results of operations in gasoline can be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. \n \u00b7 Our heating oil and residual oil financial results are seasonal and can be lower in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. Demand for some refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally higher during November through March than during April through October. We obtain a significant portion of these sales during the winter months. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters. \n \u00b7 Warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil. Because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the Northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales. Therefore, our results of operations in heating oil and residual oil for the first and fourth calendar quarters can be better than for the second and third quarters. \n \u00b7 Energy efficiency, higher prices, new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products. Higher prices and new technologies and alternative fuel sources, such as electric, hybrid or battery powered motor vehicles, could reduce the demand for transportation fuels and adversely impact our sales of transportation fuels. A reduction in sales of transportation fuels could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil. Consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades. We could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government-mandated controls or regulations further promoting the use of cleaner fuels. End users who are dual-fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas. Other end users may elect to convert to natural gas. During a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas, dual-fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas. During periods of increasing home heating oil prices relative to the price of natural gas, residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas. As described above, such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. \n \u00b7 Changes in government usage mandates and tax credits could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which could negatively impact our sales. The EPA has implemented a RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program seeks to promote the incorporation of biofuels in the nation's fuel supply and, to that end, sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the United States. A RIN is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the United States. We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RIN prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations related to the amount of RINs required and the total amounts that can be generated, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, and levels of transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline and ethanol, taking into consideration the EPA's regulations on the RFS program and oxygenate blending requirements. A reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate or oxygenate blending requirements could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol, which in turn could adversely affect our future gasoline and ethanol sales. In addition, changes in blending requirements or broadening the definition of what constitutes a renewable fuel could affect the price of RINs which could impact the magnitude of the mark-to-market liability recorded for the deficiency, if any, in our RIN position relative to our RVO at a point in time. \n \u00b7 We may not be able to fully implement or capitalize upon planned growth projects. We could have a number of organic growth projects that may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital in the aggregate. Many of these projects involve numerous regulatory, environmental, commercial and legal uncertainties beyond our control. As these projects are undertaken, required approvals, permits and licenses may not be obtained, may be delayed or may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects. Moreover, revenues associated with these organic growth projects may not increase immediately upon the expenditures of funds with respect to a particular project and these projects may be completed behind schedule or in excess of budgeted cost. We may pursue and complete projects in anticipation of market demand that dissipates or market growth that never materializes. As a result of these uncertainties, the anticipated benefits associated with our capital projects may not be achieved. \n \u00b7 New, stricter environmental laws and other industry-related regulations or environmental litigation could significantly impact our operations and/or increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating, among other matters, logistics activities, product quality specifications and other environmental matters. The trend in environmental regulation has been towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. Risks related to our environmental permits, including the risk of noncompliance, permit interpretation, permit modification, renewal of permits on less favorable terms, judicial or administrative challenges to permits by citizens groups or federal, state or local entities or permit revocation are inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We may not be able to renew the permits necessary for our operations, or we may be forced to accept terms in future permits that limit our operations or result in additional compliance costs. In recent years, the transport of crude oil and ethanol has become subject to additional regulation. The establishment of more stringent design or construction standards, or other requirements for railroad tank cars that are used to transport crude oil and ethanol with too short of a timeframe for compliance may lead to shortages of compliant railcars available to transport crude oil and ethanol, which could adversely affect our businesses. Likewise, in recent years, efforts have commenced to seek to use federal, state and local laws to contest issuance of permits, contest renewal of permits and restrict the types of railroad tanks cars that can be used to deliver products, including, without limitation, crude oil and ethanol to bulk storage terminals. Were such laws to come into effect and were they to survive appeals and judicial review, they would potentially expose our operations to duplicative and possibly inconsistent regulation. There can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. In recent years environmental interest groups have filed suit against companies in the energy industry related to climate change. Should such suits succeed, we could face additional compliance costs or litigation risks. \nResults of Operations\nEvaluating Our Results of Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These measurements include: (1) product margin, (2) gross profit, (3) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (4) distributable cash flow, (5) selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d), (6) operating expenses and (7) degree days.\nProduct Margin\nWe view product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. We review product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis. We define product margin as our product sales minus\nproduct costs. Product sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline, distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, as well as convenience store sales, gasoline station rental income and revenue generated from our logistics activities when we engage in the storage, transloading and shipment of products owned by others. Product costs primarily include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale as well as product costs related to convenience store items and costs associated with our logistics activities. We also look at product margin on a per unit basis (product margin divided by volume). Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements to assess our businesses. Product margin should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our product margin may not be comparable to product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies.\nGross Profit\nWe define gross profit as our product margin minus terminal and gasoline station related depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used as supplemental financial measures by management and may be used by external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess:\n \u00b7 our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements; \n \u00b7 our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis; \n \u00b7 our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; \n \u00b7 our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale, marketing, storing and distribution of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and in the gasoline stations and convenience stores business, without regard to financing methods and capital structure; and \n \u00b7 the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities. \nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted for gains or losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nDistributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment. Distributable cash flow as defined by our partnership agreement is net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures, as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner that are extraordinary or non-recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow.\nDistributable cash flow as used in our partnership agreement also determines our ability to make cash distributions on our incentive distribution rights. The investment community also uses a distributable cash flow metric similar to the metric used in our partnership agreement with respect to publicly traded partnerships to indicate whether or not such partnerships have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain distributions on preferred or common units or support an increase in quarterly cash distributions on common units. Our partnership agreement does not permit adjustments for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges.\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur SG&A expenses include, among other things, marketing costs, corporate overhead, employee salaries and benefits, pension and 401(k) plan expenses, discretionary bonuses, non-interest financing costs, professional fees and information technology expenses. Employee-related expenses including employee salaries, discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes, benefits, and pension and 401(k) plan expenses are paid by our general partner which, in turn, are reimbursed for these expenses by us.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals, transload facilities and gasoline stations and convenience stores used in our businesses. Lease payments, maintenance and repair, property taxes, utilities, credit card fees, taxes, labor and labor-related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. The majority of these expenses remains relatively stable, independent of the volumes through our system, but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period.\nDegree Days\nA degree day\u201d is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of 65\u00b0F. Each degree of temperature above 65\u00b0F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65\u00b0F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long-term (multi-year) average, or normal, to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service and officially archived by the National Climatic Data Center. For purposes of evaluating our results of operations, we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the National Weather Service at its Logan International Airport station in Boston, Massachusetts.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following table provides a summary of some of the key performance indicators that may be used to assess our results of operations. These comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future results (gallons and dollars in thousands):\n\n \n\n (1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d The table below presents reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n (2) Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and a lease exit and termination gain of $3.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our December 2016 voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. Excluding these expenses, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $210.4 million for 2016. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these events. \n (3) Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d As defined by our partnership agreement, distributable cash flow is not adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. The table below presents reconciliations of distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n (4) Distributable cash flow includes a net loss on sale and disposition of assets of $5.9 million, $12.5 million and $20.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $114.1 million ($149.9 million, offset by $35.8 million attributed to the noncontrolling interest) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Distributable cash flow for 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the lease termination and impairment charges. Excluding the loss on sale and disposition of assets, impairment charges and lease exit and termination expenses, distributable cash flow would have been $180.0 million, $121.6 million and $93.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, distributable cash flow also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2017, distributable cash flow also includes a $14.2 million gain on the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n (5) Crude oil consists of our crude oil sales and revenue from our logistics activities. \n (6) Other oils and related products primarily consist of distillates, residual oil and propane. \n (7) Station operations consist of convenience stores sales, rental income and sundries. \n (8) Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure which is discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d The table above includes a reconciliation of product margin on a combined basis to gross profit, a directly comparable GAAP measure. \nThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a historical basis (in thousands):\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and a lease exit and termination gain of $3.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our December 2016 voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. Excluding these expenses, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $210.4 million for 2016. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these events. \nThe following table presents reconciliations of distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a historical basis (in thousands):\n\n (1) Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is discussed above under -Evaluating Our Results of Operations.\u201d As defined by our partnership agreement, distributable cash flow is not adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. \n (2) Distributable cash flow includes a net loss on sale and disposition of assets of $5.9 million, $12.5 million and $20.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a net goodwill and long-lived asset impairment of $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $114.1 million ($149.9 million, offset by $35.8 million attributed to the noncontrolling interest) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Distributable cash flow for 2016 also includes lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million which were recorded as a result of our voluntary early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the lease termination and impairment charges. Excluding the loss on sale and disposition of assets, impairment charges and lease exit and termination expenses, distributable cash flow would have been $180.0 million, $121.6 million and $93.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, distributable cash flow also includes a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to a Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2017, distributable cash flow also includes a $14.2 million gain on the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n (3) Distributions to Series A preferred unitholders represent the distributions earned by the preferred unitholders during the period. Distributions on the Series A Preferred Units are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2018. \nResults of Operations for Years 2018, 2017 and 2016\nConsolidated Sales\nOur total sales were $12.7 billion and $8.9 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $3.8 billion, or 42%, due to increases in prices and in volume sold. Our aggregate volume of product sold was 5.8 billion gallons and 4.7 billion gallons for 2018 and 2017, respectively an increase of 1.1 billion gallons. The increase in volume sold includes an increase of 930 million gallons in our Wholesale segment, reflecting an increase in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks offset by declines in volume sold in crude oil and distillates, and increases of 116 million gallons in our Commercial segment and 51 million gallons in our GDSO segment.\nOur total sales were $8.9 billion and $8.2 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 8%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in volume sold, primarily in our Wholesale segment. Our aggregate volume of product sold was 4.7 billion gallons and 5.1 billion gallons for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of 0.4 billion gallons. The decline in volume sold includes decreases of 364 million gallons in our Wholesale segment and 6 million gallons in our GDSO segment. We had an increase of 3 million gallons in our Commercial segment.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $650.4 million and $583.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $67.3 million, or 12%, primarily due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire in July 2018 and Honey Farms in October 2017 (collectively our Recent Acquisitions\u201d) and to higher fuel margins in our GDSO segment, largely in the fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable market conditions in our Wholesale segment, primarily in gasoline and distillates.\nOur gross profit was $583.1 million and $546.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $36.6 million, or 7%, primarily due to improved product margins in gasoline distribution in our GDSO segment and crude oil in our Wholesale segment. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by product margin declines in other oils and related products in our Wholesale segment due to less favorable market conditions and in station operations in our GDSO segment due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016.\nResults for Wholesale Segment\nGasoline and Gasoline Blendstocks. Sales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $4.7 billion and $2.1 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 126%, due to increases in prices and volume sold, primarily in gasoline. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $76.7 million and $82.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline, offset by improved margins in gasoline blendstocks, primarily ethanol, due to more favorable market conditions. Our product margin in 2017 benefited from weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017 that did not occur in 2018.\nSales from wholesale gasoline and gasoline blendstocks were $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion, or 5%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our gasoline and gasoline blendstocks product margin was $82.1 million and $83.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 2%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in gasoline in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by weather-related supply disruptions in the third quarter of 2017.\nCrude Oil. Crude oil sales and logistics revenues were $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.4 billion, or 76%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude by rail differentials continued to be challenged. Our crude oil product margin was $7.2 million and $7.3 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, primarily due to lower contract revenue, partially offset by lower pipeline related expense, lower railcar lease and related expenses and lower terminal lease expense associated with the expiration of a terminal lease in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in\nrevenue recognized related to a take-or-pay contract with one particular customer compared to $21.6 million in revenue recognized in 2018 due to the expiration of that contract in June 2018. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility.\nCrude oil sales and logistics revenues were approximately $0.5 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $82.3 million, or 15%, due to a decline in volume sold as crude oil did not discount sufficiently to make rail transport to the East Coast competitive with imports. Our crude oil product margin was $7.3 million and negative $13.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $20.4 million, or 155%. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was positively impacted by $43.2 million in revenue as compared to $28.0 million in 2016 related to the absence of logistics nominations from one particular contract customer, and a $34.4 million decrease in railcar lease expense to $11.3 million as a result of our early termination of a sublease in December 2016. Our crude oil product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted by a $13.1 million expense associated with the acceleration and corresponding termination of a contractual obligation under a pipeline connection agreement with Tesoro related to the Beulah, North Dakota facility and by less volume through our system.\nOther Oils and Related Products. Sales from other oils and related products (primarily distillates, residual oil and propane) were $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $323.5 million, or 19%, due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decline in distillate volume sold. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $53.4 million and $62.8 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $9.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in distillates in the first and third quarters of 2018, offset by improved margins in distillates in the fourth quarter. Our product margin in other oils and related products for both 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted due to warmer than normal temperatures.\nSales from other oils and related products were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 13%, primarily due to an increase in prices, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Our product margin from other oils and related products was $62.8 million and $74.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 15%. Our product margin for 2017 was negatively impacted due to less favorable market conditions during the second and fourth quarters of 2017.\nResults for Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations Segment\nGasoline Distribution. Sales from gasoline distribution were $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in prices for most of 2018 and to an increase in volume sold due to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $373.3 million and $326.5 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $46.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher fuel margins as wholesale gasoline prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2018 and to our Recent Acquisitions. Our product margin for 2018 was negatively impacted by rising wholesale gasoline prices during the first six months of the year. Rising wholesale gasoline prices typically compress our gasoline product margin and declining wholesale gasoline prices typically improve our gasoline product margin, the extent of which depends on the magnitude and duration.\nSales from gasoline distribution were $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 10%, due to an increase in prices. Our product margin from gasoline distribution was $326.5 million and $289.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $37.1 million, or 13%. The increase in our gasoline product margin was primarily due to declining wholesale gasoline prices during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nStation Operations. Our station operations, which include (i) convenience stores sales at our directly operated stores, (ii) rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers or from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) sale of sundries, such as car wash sales and lottery and ATM commissions, collectively generated revenues of $0.4 billion for each of 2018 and 2017, increasing by $75.3 million, or 21%. Our product margin from station operations was $203.1 million and $175.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $28.1 million, or 16%. The increases in sales and product margin are primarily due to our Recent Acquisitions, partially offset by the\nsale of non-strategic sites.\nRevenues from our station operations, were $0.4 billion for each of 2017 and 2016, decreasing by $19.8 million, or 5%. Our product margin from station operations was $175.0 million and $183.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 5%. The decreases in sales and product margin in 2017 are primarily due to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by the addition of leased company operated sites in April 2016 and the acquisition of Honey Farms in October 2017.\nResults for Commercial Segment\nOur commercial sales were $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively, increasing by $426.6 million, or 50%, due to increases in prices and in volume sold. Our commercial product margin was $23.6 million and $17.9 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $5.7 million, or 32%, primarily due to an increase in bunkering activity.\nOur commercial sales were $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion for 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing by $157.1 million, or 23%, primarily due to higher prices. Our commercial product margin was $17.9 million and $24.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 25%. The decreases in sales and product margin are primarily due to the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017 sales.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $171.0 million and $155.0 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $16.0 million, or 10%, including increases of $4.6 million in incentive compensation, $3.2 million in acquisition costs, $2.1 million in wages and benefits, $1.2 million in license fees, $1.1 million in depreciation, $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $2.9 million in various SG&A expenses. The increase in acquisitions costs consists of $3.9 million incurred in 2018 related to Champlain and Cheshire compared to $0.7 million incurred in 2017 related to Honey Farms.\nSG&A expenses were $155.0 million and $149.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $5.3 million, or 4%, including increases of $5.2 million in incentive compensation and $2.4 million in professional fees. In addition, during 2017, we incurred $1.1 million for certain costs in connection with a compensation funding agreement with our general partner (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in SG&A expenses was offset, in part, by decreases of $0.9 million in bad debt expense and $0.6 million in salaries and wages, as well as a decline of $1.9 million in severance charges incurred primarily in 2016 related to a reduction in our workforce.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $321.1 million and $283.6 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $37.5 million, or 13%, primarily due to an increase of $35.5 million associated with our GDSO operations, due largely to our Recent Acquisitions and to increases in credit card fees, partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the sale of sites. Operating expenses associated with our terminal operations increased by $2.0 million.\nOperating expenses were $283.6 million and $288.5 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 2%. Operating expenses decreased by $2.6 million associated with our GDSO operations due, in part, to the sale of sites, including the Drake Sites sold in August 2016, partially offset by increases in credit card fees due to higher wholesale gasoline prices and in rent expense associated with the addition of leased sites, and the Honey Farms acquisition in October 2017. Operating expenses also decreased by $2.5 million at our Basin Transload facilities in North Dakota due to less activity. In addition, in 2016, we incurred $3.1 million in costs associated with cleaning tanks and related infrastructure at our Oregon facility in order to convert the facility to ethanol transloading. The decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase of $3.3 million associated with our terminal operations.\nGain (loss) on Trustee Taxes\nIn 2018, we recognized a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, which tax credit program expired in 2011. Based upon the significant passage of time from that 2011 expiration date, including underlying statutes of limitation, as of January 31, 2018 we determined that the liability was no longer required.\nIn 2017, we recognized a loss on trustee taxes of $16.2 million related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Trustee Taxes\u201d for additional information.\nLease Exit and Termination Gain (Expenses)\nIn 2018, we were released from certain of our obligations to provide railcar storage, freight, insurance and other services for railcars under a fleet management services agreement associated with our 2016 voluntary termination of a railcar sublease. The release of certain of those obligations resulted in a $3.5 million reduction of the remaining accrued incremental costs.\nIn 2016, the lease exit and termination expenses of $80.7 million represent a one-time discounted lease termination expense related to the early termination of a sublease for 1,610 railcars leased from a third party.\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Leases\u201d for additional information.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense related to our intangible assets was $11.0 million, $9.2 million and $9.4 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases of $1.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the intangibles acquired in the Recent Acquisitions.\nNet (Loss) Gain on Sale and Disposition of Assets\nWe had net losses on the sale and disposition of assets of ($5.9 million), ($12.5 million) and ($20.5 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the sale of GDSO sites. Included in the net loss on sale and disposition of assets is approximately $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of goodwill derecognized as part of the site divestitures. For 2017, we recorded a $14.2 million gain associated with the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses in February 2017.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nIn 2018 and 2017, we recognized a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, relating to long-lived assets used at certain gasoline stations and convenience stores associated with our GDSO segment. In 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit and a long-lived asset impairment charge of $28.2 million, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $89.1 million and $86.2 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of\n$2.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher average balances on our credit facilities for 2018, in part due to the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, an increase in inventory attributable to both volume and price, and an increase in interest rates for 2018 compared to 2017.\nInterest expense was $86.2 million and $86.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, primarily due to lower average balances on our credit facilities and lower interest rates due to the May 2016 expiration of our interest rate swap, partially offset by a full year of our financing obligation recognized in connection with our sale-leaseback transaction entered into in June 2016.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIncome tax (expense) benefit was ($5.6 million), $23.6 million and ($0.1 million) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The income tax (expense) benefit recognized primarily reflects the income tax (expense) benefit from the operating results of GMG, which is a taxable entity for federal and state income tax purposes. The income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 ( the Act\u201d). As a result of the enactment of this law, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are anticipated to reverse in the future, resulting in a decrease to our net deferred tax liability of $22.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was recorded based on provisional amounts. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, including the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. There were no material adjustments to the provisional tax expense estimate that was previously recorded related to the Act. See Notes 2 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nIn February 2013, we acquired a 60% membership interest in Basin Transload. The net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $39.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represents the 40% noncontrolling ownership of the net loss reported. The noncontrolling interest for 2016 includes a $35.8 million goodwill and long-lived asset impairment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur primary liquidity needs are to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and distributions and to service our indebtedness. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, amounts available under our working capital revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Please read -Credit Agreement\u201d for more information on our working capital revolving credit facility.\nWorking capital was $292.2 million and $209.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $82.7 million, in part due to an increase of $35.7 million in inventories resulting from an increase in inventory volume and decreases of $67.7 million in trustee taxes payable and $23.4 million in the current portion of our working capital revolving credit facility which represents the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in trustee taxes payable was largely attributable to the $52.6 million extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit and the settlement of a trustee tax loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in working capital was partially offset by a decrease of $82.5 million in accounts receivable, due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer in 2017.\nCash Distributions\nCommon Units\nDuring 2018, we paid the following cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner:\n\nIn addition, on January 28, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.50 per unit ($2.00 per unit on an annualized basis) on all of our outstanding common units for the period from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 to our common unitholders of record as of the close of business February 8, 2019. This distribution resulted in our reaching our second target level distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. On February 14, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $17.3 million.\nPreferred Units\nOn November 15, 2018, we paid a cash distribution to holders of the Series A Preferred Units in the total amount of $1.8 million covering the period from August 7, 2018 (the issuance date of the Series A Preferred Units) through November 14, 2018.\nIn addition, on January 22, 2019, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.609375 per unit ($2.4375 per unit on an annualized basis) on our Series A Preferred Units for the period from November 15, 2018 through February 14, 2019 to our preferred unitholders of record as of the opening of business on February 1, 2019. On February 15, 2019, we paid the total cash distribution of approximately $1.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash. The amounts of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Includes principal and interest on our working capital revolving credit facility and our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 and assumes a ratable payment through the expiration date. Our credit agreement has a contractual maturity of April 30, 2020 and no principal payments are required prior to that date. However, we repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements. Therefore, the current portion of the working capital revolving credit facility included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is the amount we expect to pay down during the course of the year, and the long-term portion of the working capital revolving credit facility is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year. Please read -Credit Agreement\u201d for more information on our working capital revolving credit facility. \n (2) Includes principal and interest on our senior notes. No principal payments are required prior to maturity. The increase in 2022 is due to our 6.25% senior notes maturing in July 2022. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our senior notes. \n (3) Includes operating lease obligations related to leases for office space and computer equipment, land, terminals and throughputs, gasoline stations, railcars and barges. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (4) Includes amounts related to our 15-year brand fee agreement entered into in 2010 with ExxonMobil and amounts related to our pipeline connection agreements, our natural gas transportation and reservation agreements and our access right agreements (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these agreements) and pension and deferred compensation obligations. \n (5) Includes lease rental payments in connection with (i) the acquisition of Capitol related to properties previously sold by Capitol within two sale-leaseback transactions; and (ii) the sale of real property assets at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores. These transactions did not meet the criteria for sale accounting and the lease rental payments are classified as interest expense on the respective financing obligation and the pay-down of the related financing obligation. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for additional information. \nSee Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to purchase commitments and sublease information related to certain lease agreements.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations require investments to maintain, expand, upgrade and enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. We categorize our capital requirements as either maintenance capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures to repair or replace partially or fully depreciated assets to maintain the operating capacity of, or revenues generated by, existing assets and extend their useful lives. Maintenance capital expenditures also include expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, tank and pipeline integrity and safety and to address certain environmental regulations. We anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by operations. We had approximately $38.6 million, $34.7 million and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in capital expenditures in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, of which approximately $33.6 million, $27.9 million and $25.7 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are related to our investments in our gasoline stations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\nExpansion capital expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets to grow our businesses or expand our existing facilities, such as projects that increase our operating capacity or revenues by, for example, increasing dock capacity and tankage, diversifying product availability, investing in raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry gasoline stations and convenience stores, increasing storage flexibility at various terminals and by adding terminals to our storage network. We have the ability to fund our expansion capital expenditures through cash from operations or our credit agreement or by issuing debt securities or additional equity. We had approximately $175.7 million, $29.2 million and $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures, including acquisitions, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2018, the $175.7 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $145.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisitions of Cheshire and Champlain. In addition, we had $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to investments in our gasoline stations, including, in part, raze and rebuilds and new-to-industry sites.\nIn 2017, the $29.2 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately $14.1 million in property and equipment associated with the acquisition of Honey Farms. In addition, we had $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures which consists of $8.7 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and $6.4 million in other expansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nIn 2016, the $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures included approximately (i) $25.4 million in raze and rebuilds, expansion and improvements at retail gasoline stations and new-to-industry sites, and includes $5.7 million related to the addition of 22 leased sites in April 2016; (ii) $7.9 million in costs associated with our terminal assets, including $7.5 million in dock and infrastructure expansion at our Oregon facility, and (iii) $5.0 million in other\nexpansion capital expenditures, primarily related to investments in information technology and computer equipment.\nWe currently expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million and expansion capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million in 2019, relating primarily to investments in our gasoline station business. These current estimates depend, in part, on the timing of completion of projects, availability of equipment, weather and unanticipated events or opportunities requiring additional maintenance or investments.\nWe believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and the ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities to meet our financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. A material decrease in our cash flows would likely have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity as well as our ability to issue additional equity and/or debt securities.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes cash flow activity for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities generally reflects our net income, balance sheet changes arising from inventory purchasing patterns, the timing of collections on our accounts receivable, the seasonality of parts of our businesses, fluctuations in product prices, working capital requirements and general market conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $168.9 million and $348.4 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a year-over-year decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $179.5 million. For 2018, cash flow from operating activities was not impacted by the non-cash gain of $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. This gain was included in net income and offset by the corresponding decrease in the liability which had historically been included in trustee taxes (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $348.4 million for 2017 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $119.9 million for 2016, for a year-over-year increase in cash flows from operating activities of $468.3 million.\nThe primary drivers of the changes in operating activities include the following (in thousands):\n\nIn 2018, the decrease in accounts receivable was due largely to the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer at December 31, 2017 that was not recognized at December 31, 2018. The increase in inventories was due to higher inventory volume. The decrease in operating cash flow was also impacted by the year-over-year change in derivatives of $34.1 million due to market direction and in trustee taxes of $24.2 million. The change in trustee taxes in 2017 includes the $16.2 million payment related to an administratively closed New York State tax audit of our fuel and sales tax returns for the periods between December 2008 through August 2013.\nIn 2017, the decrease in inventories is due to reduced inventory volume, in part due to a change in market structure and to lower crude oil volume as compared to an increase in inventories in 2016 primarily due to higher prices. Accounts receivable decreased slightly in 2017 as compared to a $110.2 million increase in 2016 which was primarily due to higher prices and an increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer. The increase in cash flows from operating activities also reflects the period over period increase in net income which in part reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses incurred in 2016.\nIn 2016, the increases in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to higher prices. An increase in the take-or-pay receivable with one particular crude oil contract customer also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable. The $182.4 million decrease in cash flow from operating activities also reflects the decrease in net income which, in part, reflects the $80.7 million lease exit and termination expenses and the decline in crude oil product margin due to tight rail differentials. The change in derivatives year over year provided funds of $49.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $225.7 million for 2018 and included $138.2 million and $33.4 million in cash used to fund the acquisitions of Champlain and Cheshire, respectively, including inventory, $38.6 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $30.6 million in expansion capital expenditures and $3.3 million in seller note issuances, offset by $18.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. The seller note issuances represent notes we received from buyers in connection with the sale of certain of our gasoline stations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $61.6 million for 2017 and included $38.5 million in cash to fund the acquisition of Honey Farms, including inventory, $34.7 million in maintenance capital expenditures, $15.1 million in expansion capital expenditures and $6.0 million in seller note issuances, offset by $32.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment ($16.3 million from the sale of our natural gas marketing and electricity brokerage businesses, less $0.5 million in related transaction costs, and $16.9 million primarily from the sales of GDSO sites).\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $6.4 million for 2016 and included $77.7 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily associated with the sale of the Drake Sites, the periodic divestiture of gasoline stations and the strategic asset divestiture program, offset by $38.3 million in expansion capital expenditures and $33.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures.\nPlease read -Capital Expenditures\u201d for a discussion of our expansion capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $50.1 million for 2018 and included $66.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, $26.6 million in net borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $24.0 million in borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, offset by $66.0 million in cash distributions to our limited partners (preferred and common unitholders) and our general partner and $0.8 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2018.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $282.0 million for 2017 and included $197.9 million in net payments on our working capital revolving credit facility, due in part to reduced inventory volume which was partially due to a change in market structure, $62.7 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner, $20.7 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility, $0.5 million in LTIP units withheld for tax obligations related to awards that vested in 2017 and $0.5 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload, offset by $0.3 million in capital contributions from our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $122.4 million for 2016 and included $176.5 million in net borrowings from our working capital revolving credit facility, primarily due to an increase in prices, and $62.5 million in net proceeds from our sale-leaseback transaction, offset by $62.5 million in cash distributions to our common unitholders\nand our general partner, $52.3 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility representing proceeds from asset sales which was partially offset by $61.7 million in borrowings in connection with our railcar sublease termination, and $1.8 million in distributions to our noncontrolling interest at Basin Transload.\nSee Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for supplemental cash flow information related to our working capital revolving credit facility and revolving credit facility for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nCredit Agreement\nCertain subsidiaries of ours, as borrowers, and we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, have a $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility. We repay amounts outstanding and reborrow funds based on our working capital requirements and, therefore, classify as a current liability the portion of the working capital revolving credit facility we expect to pay down during the course of the year. The long-term portion of the working capital revolving credit facility is the amount we expect to be outstanding during the entire year. The credit agreement matures on April 30, 2020.\nThere are two facilities under the credit agreement:\n \u00b7 a working capital revolving credit facility to be used for working capital purposes and letters of credit in the principal amount equal to the lesser of our borrowing base and $850.0 million; and \n \u00b7 a $450.0 million revolving credit facility to be used for acquisitions, joint ventures, capital expenditures, letters of credit and general corporate purposes. \nIn addition, the credit agreement has an accordion feature whereby we may request on the same terms and conditions then applicable to the credit agreement, provided no Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) then exists, an increase to the working capital revolving credit facility, the revolving credit facility, or both, by up to another $300.0 million, in the aggregate, for a total credit facility of up to $1.6 billion. Any such request for an increase must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our lending group will agree to fund any request by us for additional amounts in excess of the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nIn addition, the credit agreement includes a swing line pursuant to which Bank of America, N.A., as the swing line lender, may make swing line loans in U.S. dollars in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (a) $75.0 million and (b) the Aggregate WC Commitments (as defined in the credit agreement). Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined in the credit agreement). The swing line is a sub-portion of the working capital revolving credit facility and is not an addition to the total available commitments of $1.3 billion.\nAvailability under the working capital revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which is redetermined from time to time and based on specific advance rates on eligible current assets. Under the credit agreement, borrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility cannot exceed the then current borrowing base. Availability under the borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, such as changes in petroleum product prices, collection cycles, counterparty performance, advance rates and limits and general economic conditions. These and other events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We can provide no assurance that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nBorrowings under the working capital revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 2.50%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 1.50%, each depending on the Utilization Amount (as defined in the credit agreement). Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at (1) the Eurocurrency rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, (2) the cost of funds rate plus 2.00% to 3.00%, or (3) the base rate plus 1.00% to 2.00%, each depending on the Combined Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\nThe average interest rates for the credit agreement were 4.0%, 3.7% and 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe credit agreement provides for a letter of credit fee equal to the then applicable working capital rate or then applicable revolver rate (each such rate as defined in the credit agreement) per annum for each letter of credit issued. In addition, we incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of each facility under the credit agreement, ranging from 0.35% to 0.50% per annum.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of $473.3 million, including $220.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit of $56.0 million. Subject to borrowing base limitations, the total remaining availability for borrowings and letters of credit was $770.7 million and $810.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries and is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries, Bursaw Oil LLC, Global Partners Energy Canada ULC, Warex Terminals Corporation, Drake Petroleum Company, Inc., Puritan Oil Company, Inc. and Maryland Oil Company, Inc.\nThe credit agreement also includes (i) a $25.0 million general secured indebtedness basket, (ii) a $25.0 million general investment basket, (iii) a $75.0 million secured indebtedness basket to permit the borrowers to enter into a Contango Facility (as defined in the credit agreement), (iv) a Sale/Leaseback Transaction (as defined in the credit agreement) basket of $100.0 million, and (v) a basket of $50.0 million in an aggregate amount over the life of the credit agreement for the purchase of our common units, provided that no Event of Default exists or would occur immediately following such purchase(s).\nIn addition, the credit agreement provides the ability for the borrowers to repay certain junior indebtedness, subject to a $100.0 million cap, so long as no Event of Default has occurred or will exist immediately after making such repayment.\nThe credit agreement imposes financial covenants that require us to maintain certain minimum working capital amounts, a minimum combined interest coverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with the foregoing covenants at December 31, 2018. The credit agreement also contains a representation whereby there can be no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the credit agreement). In addition, the credit agreement limits distributions by us to our unitholders to the amount of Available Cash (as defined in the partnership agreement).\n6.25% Senior Notes\nOn June 19, 2014, we and GLP Finance Corp. (collectively, the Issuers\u201d) entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 6.25% senior notes due 2022 (the 6.25% Notes\u201d) to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d). The 6.25% Notes were resold by the Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 6.25% Notes on June 24, 2014, the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the Indenture\u201d).\nThe 6.25% Notes mature on July 15, 2022 with interest accruing at a rate of 6.25% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2015. The 6.25% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent\nset forth in the Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 6.25% Notes may declare the 6.25% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 6.25% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 6.25% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 103.125% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2018, 101.563% for the twelve-month period beginning July 15, 2019, and 100.0% beginning on July 15, 2020 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 6.25% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the Indenture.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 6.25% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $15.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $15.0 million.\n7.00% Senior Notes\nOn June 1, 2015, the Issuers entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Initial Purchasers (as defined therein) (the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers\u201d) pursuant to which the Issuers agreed to sell $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers' 7.00% senior notes due 2023 (the 7.00% Notes\u201d) to the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 7.00% Notes were resold by the 7.00% Notes Initial Purchasers to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nIndenture\nIn connection with the private placement of the 7.00% Notes on June 4, 2015 the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the 7.00% Notes Indenture\u201d).\nThe 7.00% Notes will mature on June 15, 2023 with interest accruing at a rate of 7.00% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2015. The 7.00% Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors to the extent set forth in the 7.00% Notes Indenture. Upon a continuing event of default, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the 7.00% Notes may declare the 7.00% Notes immediately due and payable, except that an event of default resulting from entry into a bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us, any restricted subsidiary of ours that is a significant subsidiary or any group of our restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary of ours, will automatically cause the 7.00% Notes to become due and payable.\nThe Issuers have the option to redeem the 7.00% Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices of 105.250% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2018, 103.500% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2019, 101.750% for the twelve-month period beginning June 15, 2020, and 100.0% beginning June 15, 2021 and at any time thereafter, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The holders of the 7.00% Notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the 7.00% Notes following certain asset sales or a Change of Control (as defined in the 7.00% Notes Indenture) at the prices and on the terms specified in the 7.00% Notes Indenture.\nThe 7.00% Notes Indenture contains covenants that will limit our ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness and issue preferred securities, make certain dividends and distributions, make certain investments and other restricted payments, restrict distributions by our subsidiaries, create liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. Events of default under the 7.00% Notes Indenture include (i) a default in payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the 7.00% Notes, (ii) breach of our covenants under the 7.00% Notes Indenture, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of ours or certain subsidiaries if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million and (v) failure to pay within 60 days uninsured final judgments exceeding $50.0 million.\nFinancing Obligations\nCapitol Acquisition\nOn June 1, 2015, we acquired retail gasoline stations and dealer supply contracts from Capitol Petroleum Group ( Capitol\u201d). In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a financing obligation of $89.6 million associated with two sale-leaseback transactions by Capitol for 53 leased sites that did not meet the criteria for sale accounting. During the terms of these leases, which expire in May 2028 and September 2029, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense of approximately $9.4 million, $9.6 million and $9.6 million was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The financing obligation will amortize through expiration of the leases based upon the lease rental payments which were $9.7 million, $9.7 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $87.5 million associated with the Capitol acquisition.\nSale-Leaseback Transaction\nOn June 29, 2016, we sold to a premier institutional real estate investor (the Buyer\u201d) real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island (the Sale-Leaseback Sites\u201d) for a purchase price of approximately $63.5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into a Master Unitary Lease Agreement with the Buyer to lease back the real property assets sold with respect to the Sale-Leaseback Sites (such Master Lease Agreement, together with the Sale-Leaseback Sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction\u201d). The Master Unitary Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of fifteen years that expires in 2031. We have one successive option to renew the lease for a ten-year period followed by two successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods on the same terms, covenants, conditions and rental as the primary non-revocable lease term. We do not have any residual interest nor the option to repurchase any of the sites at the end of the lease term. The proceeds from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction were used to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nThe sale did not meet the criteria for sale accounting as of December 31, 2018 due to prohibited continuing involvement. Specifically, the sale is considered a partial-sale transaction, which is a form of continuing involvement as we did not transfer to the Buyer the storage tank systems which are considered integral equipment of the Sale-Leaseback Sites. Additionally, a portion of the sold sites have material sub-lease arrangements, which is also a form of continuing involvement. As the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites did not meet the criteria for sale accounting, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Sites for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs a result of not meeting the criteria for sale accounting for these sites, the Sale-Leaseback Transaction is accounted for as a financing arrangement. As such, the property and equipment sold and leased back by us has not been derecognized and continues to be depreciated. We recognized a corresponding financing obligation of $62.5 million equal to the $63.5 million cash proceeds received for the sale of these sites, net of $1.0 million financing fees. During the term of the lease, which expires in June 2031, in lieu of recognizing lease expense for the lease rental payments, we incur interest expense associated with the financing obligation. Lease rental payments are recognized as both interest expense and a reduction of the principal balance associated with the financing obligation. Interest expense was $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and lease rental payments were $4.5 million, $4.5 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016,\nrespectively. The financing obligation balance outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $62.5 million associated with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur businesses of supplying refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and other business activities, involves a number of activities that are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws. For a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our businesses, please read Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties-Environmental.\u201d For additional information regarding our environmental liabilities, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates. These estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and are recorded in the period in which they become known. We have identified the following estimates that, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis:\nInventory\nWe hedge substantially all of our petroleum and ethanol inventory using a variety of instruments, primarily exchange-traded futures contracts. These futures contracts are entered into when inventory is purchased and are either designated as fair value hedges against the inventory on a specific barrel basis for inventories qualifying for fair value hedge accounting or not designated and maintained as economic hedges against certain inventory of ours on a specific barrel basis. Changes in fair value of these futures contracts, as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged inventory, are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales. All hedged inventory designated in a fair value hedge relationship is valued using the lower of cost, as determined by specific identification, or net realizable value, as determined at the product level. All petroleum and ethanol inventory not designated in a fair value hedging relationship is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. RIN inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Convenience store inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost, based on a weighted average cost method, or net realizable value.\nIn addition to our own inventory, we have exchange agreements for petroleum products and ethanol with unrelated third-party suppliers, whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and suppliers may draw inventory from us. Positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable. Negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable. Exchange transactions are valued using current carrying costs.\nLeases\nWe have terminal and throughput lease arrangements with various other oil terminals and third parties, certain of which arrangements have minimum usage requirements. In addition, we lease certain gasoline stations from third\nparties under long-term arrangements with various expiration dates. We also have several long-term lease agreements with Getty Realty, which enables us to supply and operate certain Getty Realty gasoline station sites, and with the Port of Columbia County (formerly known as Port of St. Helens) in Clatskanie, Oregon for land and for access rights to a rail spur and dock located at our Oregon facility.\nWe have future commitments, principally for office space and computer equipment, under the terms of operating lease arrangements. We also lease railcars and barges through various lease arrangements with various expiration dates. We have rental income from gasoline stations and cobranding arrangements and lease income from space leased to several unrelated third parties at several of our terminals.\nIn addition, in June of 2016, we sold real property assets, including the buildings, improvements and appurtenances thereto, at 30 gasoline stations and convenience stores. In connection with this sale-leaseback transaction, we are party to a master unitary lease agreement with the buyer to lease back those real property assets sold with respect to such sites. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting and reporting guidance for leases requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. The lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. Lease rental expense and income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nWe will be adopting ASU 2016-02, Leases,\u201d effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and do not expect this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations. However, we estimate approximately $0.3 billion of right-of-use assets and liabilities will be recognized upon adoption on our consolidated balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery, net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. We may also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale, which are included in cost of sales.\nContracts with customers typically contain pricing provisions that are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on quality and freight due to location differences and prevailing supply and demand conditions, as well as other factors. As a result, the price of the products fluctuates to remain competitive with other available product supplies. The revenue associated with such arrangements is recognized upon delivery.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from our logistics activities when we store, transload and ship products owned by others. Revenue from logistics services is recognized as services are provided.\nLogistics agreements may require counterparties to throughput a minimum volume over an agreed-upon period and may include make-up rights if the minimum volume is not met. We recognize revenue associated with make-up rights at the earlier of when the make-up volume is shipped, the make-up right expires or when it is determined that the likelihood that the shipper will utilize the make-up right is remote.\nWe also recognize convenience store sales of gasoline, grocery and other merchandise and sundries at the time of the sale to the customer. Gasoline station rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nProduct revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements, which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products, gasoline blendstocks, renewable fuels and crude oil of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets. We recognize net exchange differentials due from exchange partners in sales upon delivery of product to an exchange partner. We recognize net exchange differentials due to exchange partners in cost of sales upon receipt of product from an exchange partner.\nThe amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon a specific analysis of aged accounts while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis, such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers. Bad debt provisions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTrustee Taxes\nWe collect trustee taxes, which consist of various pass through taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities, and remit such taxes directly to those taxing authorities. Examples of trustee taxes include, among other things, motor fuel excise tax and sales and use tax. As such, it is our policy to exclude trustee taxes from revenues and cost of sales and account for them as current liabilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may be subject to audits of our state and federal tax returns prepared for trustee taxes.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe principally use derivative instruments, which include regulated exchange-traded futures and options contracts (collectively, exchange-traded derivatives\u201d) and physical and financial forwards and over-the counter ( OTC\u201d) swaps (collectively, OTC derivatives\u201d), to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity market prices and interest rates. We use these exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to hedge commodity price risk associated with our inventory and undelivered forward commodity purchases and sales ( physical forward contracts\u201d). We account for derivative transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging,\u201d and recognize derivatives instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The changes in fair value of the derivative transactions are presented currently in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to our brokers upon liquidation of these contracts. The fair value of these exchange-traded derivative transactions is presented on a net basis, offset by the cash balances on deposit with our brokers, presented as brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of OTC derivative transactions reflects amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party upon liquidation of these contracts under current market conditions. The fair value of these OTC derivative transactions is presented on a gross basis as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, unless a legal right of offset exists. The presentation of the change in fair value of our exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivative transactions depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nDerivatives Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to hedge commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\nFair Value Hedges\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to hedge price risk in commodity inventories and principally include exchange-traded futures contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item of the risk being hedged. Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operation through cost of sales. These futures contracts are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nOur fair value hedges include exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC derivative contracts that are hedges against inventory with specific futures contracts matched to specific barrels. The change in fair value of these futures contracts and the change in fair value of the underlying inventory generally provide an offset to each other in the consolidated statement of operations.\nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge interest rate risk from fluctuations in interest rates and may include various interest rate derivative instruments entered into with major financial institutions. For a\nderivative instrument being designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations through interest expense in the same period that the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations immediately.\nDerivatives Not Accounted for as Hedges-We utilize petroleum and ethanol commodity contracts, foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts to hedge price and currency risk in certain commodity inventories and physical forward contracts.\nPetroleum and Ethanol Commodity Contracts\nWe use exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge price risk in certain commodity inventories which do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting or are not designated by us as fair value hedges. Additionally, we use exchange-traded derivative contracts, and occasionally financial forward and OTC swap agreements, to hedge commodity price exposure associated with our physical forward contracts which are not designated by us as cash flow hedges. These physical forward contracts, to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative, are considered OTC physical forwards and are reflected as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The related exchange-traded derivative contracts (and financial forward and OTC swaps, if applicable) are also reflected as brokerage margin deposits (and derivative assets or derivative liabilities, if applicable) in the consolidated balance sheet, thereby creating an economic hedge. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales. These exchange traded derivatives are settled on a daily basis by us through brokerage margin accounts.\nWhile we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our commodity product purchase and sale activities, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily purchases and sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as other logistical issues inherent in our businesses, such as weather conditions. In connection with managing these positions, we are aided by maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace. We also engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of 250,000 barrels of commodity products at any one point in time. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through cost of sales.\nMargin Deposits\nAll of our exchange-traded derivative contracts (designated and not designated) are transacted through clearing brokers. We deposit initial margin with the clearing brokers, along with variation margin, which is paid or received on a daily basis, based upon the changes in fair value of open futures contracts and settlement of closed futures contracts. Cash balances on deposit with clearing brokers and open equity are presented on a net basis within brokerage margin deposits in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We have concluded that our operating segments are also our reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Derecognized goodwill associated with our disposition activities of GDSO sites is included in the carrying value of assets sold in determining the gain or loss on disposal, to the extent the disposition of assets qualifies as a disposition of a business under ASC 805. The GDSO reporting unit's goodwill that was derecognized related to the disposition of sites that met the definition of a business was $3.9 million, $4.0 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nDuring both 2018 and 2017, we completed a quantitative assessment for the GDSO reporting unit. Factors included in the assessment included both macro-economic conditions and industry specific conditions, and the fair value of the GDSO reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of a discounted cash flow approach and a market\ncomparables approach. Based on our assessment, no impairment was identified.\nIn 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $121.7 million related to the Wholesale reporting unit, substantially all of which is due to crude oil related activities. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the facts and circumstances related to the impairment charges.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Asset Impairment\nAccounting and reporting guidance for long-lived assets requires that a long-lived asset (group) be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Accordingly, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment are identified. If indicators of impairment are present, we assess impairment by comparing the undiscounted projected future cash flows from the long-lived assets to their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the long-lived assets will be reduced to their fair value.\nEnvironmental and Other Liabilities\nWe record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. Costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes.\nEstimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized when related contingencies are resolved, generally upon cash receipt.\nWe are subject to other contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters, including, environmental matters and contract and employment claims. Environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses previously owned. Further, due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations, there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in Note 2 of Notes to

and a net loss of $199.4 million in 2016. The loss in 2016 was largely due to goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges.\n\n- Total sales were $12.7 billion in 2018, up 42% from 2017, primarily due to higher prices and volumes. Sales were $8.9 billion in 2017, up 8% from 2016.  \n\n- Gross profit was $650.4 million in 2018, $583.1 million in 2017, and $546.5 million in 2016. The increases were driven by acquisitions, higher fuel margins, and improved market conditions.\n\n- SG&A expenses were $171.0 million in 2018, up 10% from 2017, mainly due to increases in incentive compensation, acquisition costs, wages and other expenses. \n\n- The company had cash provided by operating activities of $168.9 million in 2018 compared to $348.4 million in 2017 and cash used of $119.9 million in 2016. The changes were primarily driven by working capital fluctuations.\n\n- Expansion capital expenditures were $175.7 million in 2018, $29.2 million in 2017, and $38.3 million in 2016, related to acquisitions, investments in gasoline stations, and other growth projects.\n\n- At December 31, 2018, the company had total liquidity of $770.7 million available under its credit facilities. The facilities mature in April 2020.\n\n- The adoption of the new lease accounting standard in 2019 is expected to add approximately $0.3 billion of right-of-use assets and liabilities to the balance sheet but is not expected to materially impact net income.\n\nIn summary, the company grew sales and profitability in 2018 through acquisitions and improved market conditions. It continues to invest in growth projects while maintaining adequate liquidity. The adoption of the new lease standard in 2019 is not expected to significantly impact financial results."}
