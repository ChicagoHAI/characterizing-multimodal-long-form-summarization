(Concho), an independent\noil\nand gas exploration and production company\nwith operations across New Mexico and West Texas.\nThe\naddition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland Basins creates a sizeable\nPermian presence to\naugment our leading unconventional positions\nin the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48\nand the Montney\nin Canada.\nConsideration for the all-stock transaction was\nvalued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares\nof ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock was exchanged for each outstanding\nshare of Concho common stock, resulting\nin the issuance\nof approximately 286 million shares of ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock.\nWe also assumed $3.9 billion in\naggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for\nConcho, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7\nbillion as\nof the closing date.\nThe combined companies are expected to\ncapture approximately $750 million of annual\ncost and capital savings by 2022.\nFor additional information\nrelated to this transaction, see Note 25-\nAcquisition of Concho Resources Inc. in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nThe energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with\nsimultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove\nthe industry into a severe downturn.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich\ncontinues to have unprecedented social and economic\nconsequences.\nMitigation efforts to stop the spread of\nthis highly-contagious disease include stay-at-home\norders and business closures that caused\nsharp\ncontractions in economic activity worldwide.\nThe supply shock was triggered by disagreements\nbetween\nOPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020,\nwhich resulted in significant supply coming\nonto the\nmarket\nand an oil price war.\nThese dual demand and supply shocks caused\noil prices to collapse as we exited\nthe first quarter of 2020.\nAs we entered the second quarter of 2020, predictions\nof COVID-19 driven global oil demand losses\nintensified, with forecasts\nof unprecedented demand declines.\nBased on these forecasts, OPEC plus nations\nheld an emergency meeting, and in April they announced\na coordinated production cut that was unprecedented\nin both its magnitude and duration.\nThe OPEC plus agreement spans from May 2020\nuntil April 2022, with\nthe volume of production cuts easing over time.\nAdditionally, non-OPEC plus countries, including the U.S.,\nCanada, Brazil and other G-20 countries,\nannounced organic reductions to production through the\nrelease of\ndrilling rigs, frac crews, normal field decline\nand curtailments.\nDespite these planned production decreases,\nthe supply cuts were not timely enough to overcome\nsignificant demand decline.\nFutures prices for April WTI\nclosed under $20 a barrel for the first time\nsince 2001, followed by May WTI settling below zero on the\nday\nbefore futures contracts expiry, as holders of May futures contracts struggled to exit\npositions and avoid taking\nphysical delivery.\nAs storage constraints approached, spot prices in\nApril for certain North American\nlandlocked grades of crude oil were in the single digits\nor even negative for particularly remote or low-grade\ncrudes, while waterborne priced crudes such as\nBrent sold at a relative advantage.\nThe extreme volatility\nexperienced\nin the first half of the year settled down in the\nsecond half of the year, with WTI crude oil prices\nexiting the year near $50 per barrel.\nSince the start of the severe downturn, we have closely\nmonitored the market and taken prudent actions in\nresponse to this situation.\nWe entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of\nmore than $5 billion, short-term investments\nof $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility\nof $6 billion, totaling\napproximately $14 billion in available liquidity.\nAdditionally, we had several entity and asset sales\nagreements in place, which generated $1.3 billion\nin proceeds from dispositions during 2020.\nFor more\ninformation about the sales of our Australia-West and non-core Lower 48 assets, see\nNote 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThis relative advantage\nallowed us to be measured in our response to\nthe sudden change in business environment.\nIn March, we announced an initial set of actions\nto address the downturn and followed up with additional\nactions in April.\nThe combined announcements reflected a reduction\nin our 2020 operating plan capital of $2.3\nbillion, a reduction to our operating costs of\n$600 million and suspension of our share\nrepurchase program.\nThese actions decreased uses of cash by approximately\n$5 billion in 2020.\nWe also established a framework\nfor evaluating our assets and implementing\neconomic production curtailments considering\nthe weakness in oil\nprices during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted\nin taking an additional significant step of voluntarily\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nIn the second quarter, we curtailed production by an estimated 225 MBOED,\nwith 145 MBOED of the\ncurtailments from the Lower 48, 40 MBOED from\nAlaska and 30 MBOED from our Surmont operation\nin\nCanada.\nThe remainder of the second-quarter curtailments\nwere primarily in Malaysia.\nOther industry\noperators also cut production and development\nplans and as we progressed through the second quarter, certain\nstay-at-home restrictions eased, which partially\nrestored lost demand, and WTI and Brent prices\nexited the\nsecond quarter around $40 per barrel.\nBased on our economic framework, we began\nrestoring production from\nvoluntary curtailments in July, and with oil stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we\nended our curtailment\nprogram during the third quarter.\nCurtailments in the third quarter averaged approximately\n90 MBOED, with\n65 MBOED attributable to the Lower 48 and 15 MBOED\nto Surmont.\nIn August 2020, we acquired\nadditional Montney acreage for cash consideration\nof $382 million, after\ncustomary post-closing adjustments.\nWe also assumed $31 million in financing obligations for associated\npartially owned infrastructure.\nThis acquisition consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties and included\n140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed\nasset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent\nto our\nexisting Montney position.\nThe transaction increased our Montney acreage\nposition to approximately 295,000\nnet acres with a 100 percent working interest.\nSee Note 4-Acquisitions and Dispositions in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\nIn October 2020, we announced an increase to our\nquarterly dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.43\nper share\nand resumed\nshare repurchases before suspending our\nshare repurchase program upon entry into\nour definitive\nagreement to acquire Concho.\nWe resumed shares repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our\nConcho acquisition.\nWe ended the year with over $12 billion of liquidity, comprised of $3.0 billion in cash\nand cash equivalents, $3.6 billion in short-term\ninvestments, and available borrowings under our credit\nfacility\nof $5.7 billion.\nOur expectation is that commodity prices will\nremain cyclical and volatile, and a successful\nbusiness strategy\nin the E&P industry must be resilient in\nlower price environments, at the same time retaining\nupside during\nperiods of higher prices.\nWhile we are not impervious to current market\nconditions, we believe our decisive\nactions over the last several years of focusing on free\ncash flow generation, high-grading our asset\nbase,\nlowering the cost of supply of our investment\nresource portfolio, and strengthening our\nbalance sheet have put\nus in a strong relative position compared to our\nindependent E&P peers.\nWe remain committed to the core\nprinciples of our value proposition, namely, free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet, commitment to\ndifferential returns of and on capital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOur workforce and operations have adjusted to\nmitigate the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nWe have\noperations in remote areas with confined spaces,\nsuch as offshore platforms, the North Slope of Alaska,\nCurtis\nIsland in Australia, western Canada and Indonesia,\nwhere viruses could rapidly spread.\nPersonnel are asked to\nperform a self-assessment for symptoms of illness\neach day and, when appropriate, are subject to\nmore\nrestrictive measures before traveling to and working\non location.\nStaffing levels in certain operating locations\nhave been reduced to minimize health risk exposure\nand increase social distancing.\nA portion of our office\nstaff have continued to work successfully remotely, with offices around the world carefully\ndesigning and\nexecuting a flexible, phased reentry, following national, state and local guidelines.\nThese mitigation measures\nhave thus far been effective at reducing business operation\ndisruptions.\nWorkforce health and safety remains\nthe overriding driver for our actions and we have\ndemonstrated our ability to adapt to local\nconditions as\nwarranted.\nThe marketing and supply chain\nside of our business has also adapted in response\nto COVID-19.\nOur\ncommercial organization managed transportation commitments\nduring our voluntary curtailment program.\nOur supply chain function is proactively working\nwith vendors to ensure the continuity of our business\noperations, monitor distressed service and materials\nproviders, capture deflation opportunities, and pursue\ncost\nreduction efforts.\nWe also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period\nand\nrequested credit assurances when applicable.\nOperationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business.\nIn 2020, production of 1,127 MBOED\ngenerated cash provided by operating activities\nof $4.8 billion.\nWe invested $4.7\nbillion into the business in\nthe form of capital expenditures, including $0.5\nbillion of acquisition capital, and paid dividends\nto\nshareholders of $1.8 billion.\nProduction decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent\nin 2020, compared to 2019.\nProduction excluding\nLibya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions\nand dispositions;\nand excluding Libya, production for 2020\nwould have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15\nMBOED compared with 2019 production.\nThis decrease\nwas primarily due to normal field decline, partly\noffset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway,\nAlaska and China.\nProduction from Libya averaged 9 MBOED\nas it was in force majeure during a significant\nportion of the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Summary\nSignificant items during 2020 and recent announcements\nincluded the following:\n\u25cf\nEnhanced both our portfolio and financial framework through the\nacquisition of Concho in an all-stock\ntransaction, as well as purchasing bolt-on acreage in Canada and Lower\n48.\n\u25cf\nFull-year production, excluding Libya, of 1,118\nMBOED; curtailed approximately 80 MBOED during the\nyear.\n\u25cf\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion.\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.3 billion in disposition proceeds from non-core asset sales.\n\u25cf\nDistributed $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $0.9 billion of shares.\n\u25cf\nEnded the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.0 billion and\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion,\nequaling $6.6 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\u25cf\nAnnounced two significant discoveries in Norway and achieved first production\nat Tor II; continued\nappraisal drilling and started up first pads and related infrastructure\nin Montney.\n\u25cf\nAdopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with ambition to achieve net\n-zero operated emissions by\n2050 as part of our commitment to ESG excellence.\n\u25cf\nRecognized impairments of proved and unproved properties totaling $1.3\nbillion after-tax.\nBusiness Environment\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $42 per barrel in 2020,\ncompared with $64 per barrel in 2019.\nThe energy\nindustry has periodically experienced this type\nof volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand\nconditions\nand such volatility may persist for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nCommodity prices are the most significant\nfactor\nimpacting our profitability and related reinvestment\nof operating cash flows into our business.\nOur strategy is\nto create value through price cycles by delivering\non the foundational principles that underpin our\nvalue\nproposition; free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet,\ncommitment to differential returns of and on\ncapital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOperational and Financial Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nThe focus areas we believe will drive our success\nthrough the price cycles include:\n\u25cf\nFree cash flow generation.\nThis is a core principle of our value proposition.\nOur goal is to achieve\nstrong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline,\ncontrolling our costs, and safely and reliably\ndelivering production.\nThroughout the price cycles, we expect to make capital\ninvestments sufficient\nto sustain production.\nFree cash flow provides funds that are available\nto return to shareholders,\nstrengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles, or reinvest back into\nthe business for future cash flow expansion.\no\nMaintain capital allocation discipline.\nWe participate in a commodity price-driven and\ncapital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment\ndecision is made\nto the time an asset is operational and generates cash\nflow.\nAs a result, we must invest\nsignificant capital dollars to explore for new oil\nand gas fields, develop newly discovered\nfields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines\nand LNG facilities.\nWe allocate\ncapital across a geographically diverse, low cost\nof supply resource base, which combined\nwith legacy assets results in low production decline.\nCost of supply is the WTI equivalent\nprice that generates a 10 percent after-tax return\non a point-forward and fully burdened basis.\nFully burdened includes capital infrastructure,\nforeign exchange, price related inflation and\nG&A.\nIn setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous\napproach that evaluates projects\nusing this cost of supply criteria, which we believe\nwill lead to value maximization and cash\nflow expansion using an optimized investment\npace, not production growth for growth's sake.\nOur cash allocation priorities call for the investment\nof sufficient capital to sustain production\nand pay the existing dividend.\nAdditional capital may be allocated toward\ngrowth, but\ndiscipline will be maintained.\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of\n$5.5 billion.\nThe plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for\ninvestment in major projects, primarily in\nAlaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the\ncombined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED\nin 2021.\nThis production guidance\nexcludes Libya.\no\nControl costs and expenses.\nControlling operating and overhead costs,\nwithout compromising\nsafety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority.\nWe monitor these costs using\nvarious methodologies that are reported to senior management\nmonthly, on both an absolute-\ndollar basis and a per-unit basis.\nManaging operating and overhead costs is\ncritical to\nmaintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity\nprice\nenvironment.\nThe ability to control our operating and overhead\ncosts impacts our ability to\ndeliver strong cash from operations.\nIn 2020, our production and operating expenses\nwere 18\npercent lower than 2019, primarily due to decreased\nwellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from production curtailments across\nour North American operated assets as well as\nthe absence of costs related to our U.K. and\nAustralia-West divestitures.\nFor more\ninformation related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures, see note 4-Acquisitions\nand\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAt the time of the Concho acquisition announcement\nin October 2020, we announced planned\ncost reductions and quantified $350 million\nof annual expense savings expected to be\nachieved by 2022.\nThese reductions included approximately $150 million\ndue to streamlining\nour internal organization to appropriate levels given the\ncurrent industry environment and\nrecent asset sales; $100 million of G&A and\nG&G due to a refocused exploration program;\nand $100 million of redundant G&A costs on\na combined basis related to the Concho\nacquisition.\nSubsequent to the transaction announcement,\nwe identified $250 million of\nfurther cost reductions from the combined companies\nto be achieved by 2022.\no\nOptimize our portfolio.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho and\nsignificantly increased our unconventional portfolio\nwith years of low cost of supply\ninvestments.\nThe addition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland basins\ncreates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading\nunconventional positions in the\nEagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.\nWe added to our unconventional Montney position\nwith an asset acquisition that consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties directly adjacent\nto our existing acreage.\nThese acquisitions followed several non-core asset\nsales earlier in the year including\nAustralia-West in our Asia Pacific segment,\nand Niobrara and Waddell Ranch in the Lower\n48.\nWe managed the portfolio well during a turbulent year, with asset sales entered at the end\nof 2019 generating $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions\nin the first half of 2020,\nfollowed by opportunistic acquisitions of unconventional\nassets in the second half of 2020\nafter commodity prices had dropped.\nWe will continue to evaluate our assets to determine\nwhether they compete for capital within our portfolio\nand will optimize the portfolio as\nnecessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments.\n\u25cf\nA strong balance sheet.\nWe believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as\nours.\nOur strong operating performance buffered by a solid\nbalance sheet enables us to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles.\nOur priorities include execution of our\ndevelopment plans,\nmaintaining a growing dividend, and returning competitive\nreturns of capital to shareholders.\n\u25cf\nCommitment to differential returns of and on capital.\nWe believe in delivering value to our\nshareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by additional returns of\ncapital,\nincluding share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid dividends on our common stock\nof approximately $1.8\nbillion and repurchased $0.9\nbillion of our common stock.\nCombined, our dividend and repurchases\nrepresented\n57 percent of our net cash provided by operating\nactivities.\nSince we initiated our current\nshare repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased\n189 million shares for $10.5 billion,\nwhich represents approximately 15 percent of shares\noutstanding as of September 30, 2016.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase\nauthority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase\nprogram our Board of Directors had authorized.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion,\nat prevailing prices, subject to market conditions\nand other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors Our\nability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase\nshares is subject to certain considerations.\u201d\nIn October 2020, we announced that our Board\nof Directors approved an increase to our quarterly\ndividend of $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share.\nIn February 2021, we resumed share repurchases\nafter\nthe completion of our Concho acquisition.\n\u25cf\nESG Leadership.\nSafety and environmental stewardship,\nincluding the operating integrity of our\nassets, remain our highest priorities, and we\nare committed to protecting the health and\nsafety of\neveryone who has a role in our operations and\nthe communities in which we operate.\nWe strive to\nconduct our business with respect and care for\nboth the local and global environment and\nsystematically manage risk to drive sustainable business\ngrowth.\nDemonstrating our commitment to\nsustainability and environmental stewardship, in\nOctober 2020, we announced our adoption of a Paris-\naligned climate risk framework as part of our continued\nleadership in ESG excellence.\nThis\ncomprehensive climate risk strategy should enable\nus to sustainably meet global energy demand while\ndelivering competitive returns through the energy transition.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross\noperated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity\nby 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030,\nwith an\nambition to achieve net zero by 2050 for operated\nemissions.\nWe are advocating for reduction of\nscope 3 end-use emissions intensity through our\nsupport for a U.S. carbon price and reaffirmed\nour\ncommitment to the Climate Leadership Council.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to\nwork towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030\nand are the first U.S.-based oil and gas company\nto\nadopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy.\n\u25cf\nAdd to our proved reserve base.\nWe primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\no\nPurchases of increased interests in existing\nfields and acquisitions.\no\nApplication of new technologies and processes\nto improve recovery from existing fields.\no\nSuccessful exploration, exploitation and development\nof new and existing fields.\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines,\nthe estimated future date when an asset will reach\nthe\nend of its economic life is based on historical 12-month\nfirst-of-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will\nend and affects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the estimate of proved reserves also\nchanges.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices\nrise.\nReserve replacement represents the net change in\nproved reserves, net of production, divided\nby our\ncurrent year production, as shown in our supplemental\nreserve table disclosures.\nOur reserve\nreplacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting\nthe impact of lower prices, which reduced\nreserves by approximately 600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas negative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, primarily\nimpacted by lower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended\nDecember 31, 2020, which excluded\na net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales\nand purchases, was\n53 percent.\nAccess to additional resources may become increasingly\ndifficult as commodity prices can make\nprojects uneconomic or unattractive.\nIn addition, prohibition of direct investment\nin some nations,\nnational fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies,\nand lack of access\nto high-potential areas due to environmental or other\nregulation may negatively impact our\nability to\nincrease our reserve base.\nAs such, the timing and level at which we add\nto our reserve base may, or\nmay not, allow us to replace our production\nover subsequent years.\n\u25cf\nApply technical capability.\nWe leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely\ndeliver on our plans.\nTechnical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically\nconvert\nadditional resources to reserves, achieve greater\noperating efficiencies and reduce our environmental\nimpact.\nCompanywide, we continue to leverage knowledge\nof technological successes across our\noperations.\nWe have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to\nwork and operate\nmore efficiently.\nPredictive analytics have been adopted in our operations\nand planning process.\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning and\ndeep learning are being used for emissions\nmonitoring,\nseismic advancements and advanced controls in\nour field operations.\n\u25cf\nAttract, develop and retain a talented work force.\nWe strive to attract, develop and retain individuals\nwith the knowledge and skills to successfully\nexecute our business strategy in a manner\nexemplifying\nour core values and ethics.\nWe offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the\nbest early career talent.\nWe also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad\nrange of expertise and experience.\nWe promote continued learning, development and technical\ntraining through structured development programs\ndesigned to enhance the technical and functional\nskills of our employees.\nOther Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nOther significant factors that can affect our profitability\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEnergy commodity prices.\nOur earnings and operating cash flows generally\ncorrelate with industry\nprice levels for crude oil and natural gas.\nIndustry price levels are subject to factors external\nto the\ncompany and over which we have no control, including\nbut not limited to global economic health,\nsupply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil\nunrest or military conflicts, actions taken by\nOPEC\nand other producing countries, environmental laws,\ntax regulations, governmental policies and\nweather-related disruptions.\nThe following graph depicts the average benchmark\nprices for WTI\ncrude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural\ngas:\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $41.68 per barrel\nin 2020, a decrease of 35 percent compared\nwith\n$64.30 per barrel in 2019.\nSimilarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 31 percent from $57.02 per\nbarrel in 2019 to $39.37 per barrel in 2020.\nCrude oil prices were lower due to the dual\ndemand and\nsupply shocks.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which continues to\nhave unprecedented social and economic consequences.\nThe supply shock was triggered by\ndisagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning\nin early March 2020, which resulted in\nsignificant supply coming onto the market\nand created higher inventory levels.\nHenry Hub natural gas prices\ndecreased 21 percent from an average of $2.63\nper MMBTU in 2019 to\n$2.08 per MMBTU in 2020.\nHenry Hub prices were depressed due to high\nstorage levels and weak\ndemand.\nOur realized bitumen price decreased 75 percent\nfrom an average of $31.72 per barrel\nin 2019 to $8.02\nper barrel in 2020.\nThe decrease was largely driven by weakness in WTI,\nreflective of impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly\nflat as\ncurtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government,\nwhich limited production from the province,\ncontinued throughout 2020.\nWe continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through\nimprovements in alternate blend capability which\nresults in lower diluent costs and access\nto the U.S.\nGulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts.\nOur worldwide annual average realized price decreased\n34 percent from $48.78\nper BOE in 2019 to\n$32.15\nper BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized\noil, natural gas and bitumen prices.\nNorth America's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource\nscarcity to one\nof abundance.\nIn recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing\nand horizontal drilling in\nunconventional formations has led to increased industry\nactual and forecasted crude oil and natural\ngas production in the U.S.\nAlthough providing significant short-\nand long-term growth opportunities\nfor our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development\nof\nunconventional plays could also have adverse financial\nimplications to us, including: an extended\nperiod of low commodity prices; production curtailments;\nand delay of plans to develop areas such as\nunconventional fields.\nShould one or more of these events occur, our revenues would\nbe reduced, and\nadditional asset impairments might be possible.\n\u25cf\nImpairments.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry.\nAt times, our PP&E and investments\nbecome impaired when, for example, commodity\nprices decline significantly for long\nperiods of time,\nour reserve estimates are revised downward, or a\ndecision to dispose of an asset leads to\na write-down\nto its fair value.\nWe may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory\ndrilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material\nimpairment of leasehold values.\nAs we optimize\nour assets in the future, it is reasonably possible\nwe may incur future losses

information on our impairments,\nsee Note 7-Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8-Impairments, in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nEffective tax rate.\nOur operations are in countries with different tax rates\nand fiscal structures.\nAccordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment,\nour overall\neffective tax rate can vary significantly between periods\nbased on the mix\u201d of before-tax earnings\nwithin our global operations.\n\u25cf\nFiscal and regulatory environment.\nOur operations can be affected by changing economic,\nregulatory\nand political environments in the various countries\nin which we operate, including the U.S.\nCivil\nunrest or strained relationships with governments\nmay impact our operations or investments.\nThese\nchanging environments could negatively impact our\nresults of operations, and further changes to\nincrease government fiscal take could have a\nnegative impact on future operations.\nOur management\ncarefully considers the fiscal and regulatory\nenvironment when evaluating projects or\ndetermining the\nlevels and locations of our activity.\nOutlook\nProduction and Capital\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of $5.5\nbillion.\nThe\nplan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for investment\nin major projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing\nexploration appraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nRestructuring\nAs a result of the acquisition of Concho, we commenced\na restructuring program in the first quarter\nof 2021 in\nassociation with combining the operations of the\ntwo companies.\nWe expect to incur significant non-recurring\ntransaction and acquisition-related costs in\n2021 for employee severance payments; incremental\npension\nbenefit costs related to the workforce reductions; employee\nretention costs; employee relocations; fees\npaid to\nfinancial, legal, and accounting advisors; and\nfiling fees.\nWe currently cannot estimate these costs, as well as\nother unanticipated items,\nand expect to recognize the majority\nof these expenses in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily\ndefined by geographic region:\nAlaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East\nand North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs\nnot directly associated with an operating\nsegment, such as\nmost interest expense, premiums incurred on the\nearly retirement of debt, corporate overhead,\ncertain\ntechnology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical\ntables provided at the beginning of the operating\nsegment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity\nprices and production.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEffective with the third quarter of 2020, we have restructured our segments to align with\nchanges to our\ninternal organization.\nThe Middle East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific and Middle East\nsegment\nto the Europe and North Africa segment.\nThe segments have been renamed the Asia Pacific\nsegment and the\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nWe have revised segment information disclosures and\nsegment performance metrics presented within our results of operations for the\ncurrent and prior years.\nThis section of the Form 10-K\ndiscusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020\nand 2019.\nFor discussion of\nyear-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, see\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\" in Exhibit\n99.1\n-\n, Item 7 filed with

ConocoPhillips\ndecreased $9.9 billion in 2020.\nThe decrease was mainly due\nto:\n\u25cf\nLower realized commodity prices.\n\u25cf\nLower sales volumes due to normal field decline,\nasset dispositions and production curtailments.\nFor\nadditional information related to dispositions,\nsee Note 4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated\nwith the completion of the sale of two\nConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nFor additional information, see Note 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\u25cf\nAn unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax\non our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2020,\nas compared to a $649 million after-tax unrealized\ngain on those shares in 2019.\n\u25cf\nA $648 million after-tax impairment for the associated\ncarrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs and an equity method investment\nrelated to our Alaska North Slope Gas\nasset.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nIncreased impairments\nprimarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets which were\nwritten down to fair value due to lower commodity\nprices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of other income of $317 million after-tax\nrelated to our settlement agreement with\nPDVSA.\nThese decreases in net income (loss) were partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nLower production and operating expenses, primarily\ndue to the absence of costs related to our U.K.\nand Australia-West divestitures and decreased wellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from\nproduction curtailments across our North American\noperated assets.\n\u25cf\nA $597 million after-tax gain on dispositions related\nto our Australia-West divestiture.\n\u25cf\nLower DD&A expenses, primarily due to lower\nvolumes related to normal field decline and\nproduction curtailments as well as impacts\nof our Australia-West and U.K. divestitures.\nPartly\noffsetting this decrease, was higher DD&A expenses\ndue to price-related downward reserve revisions.\nIncome Statement Analysis\n2020 vs. 2019\nSales and other operating revenues decreased 42 percent\nin 2020, mainly due to lower realized commodity\nprices and lower sales volumes.\nSales volumes decreased due to normal field\ndecline, production curtailments\nfrom our North American operated assets and the\ndivestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and\nour Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates decreased $347 million\nin 2020, primarily due to lower earnings from\nQG3 and\nAPLNG because of lower LNG prices.\nPartly offsetting this decrease was the absence\nof impairments related\nto equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment\nof $155 million and the absence of a $118 million\ndeferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nGain on dispositions decreased $1.4 billion in\n2020, primarily due to the absence of a $1.7 billion\nbefore-tax\ngain associated with the completion of the sale\nof two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nPartly offsetting the\ndecrease was a $587 million before-tax gain associated\nwith our Australia-West divestiture.\nFor more\ninformation related to these dispositions, see Note\n4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (loss) decreased $1.9 billion\nin 2020, primarily due to a before-tax unrealized\nloss of $855\nmillion on our CVE common shares in 2020, and\nthe absence of a $649 million before-tax unrealized\ngain on\nthose shares in 2019.\nAdditionally, other income (loss) decreased due to the absence of $325 million\nbefore-\ntax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA.\nFor discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 6-Investment\nin Cenovus Energy in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nFor discussion of our PDVSA settlement,\nsee Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nPurchased commodities decreased 32 percent in\n2020, primarily due to lower natural gas\nand crude oil prices;\nlower crude oil and natural gas volumes purchased;\nand the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the\nthird quarter of\n2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nProduction and operating expenses decreased $978\nmillion in 2020, primarily due to reduced activities\nand\ntransportation costs associated with lower activity\nacross our North American operated assets in\nresponse to\nthe low commodity price environment and the\nabsence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West\ndivestitures.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased\n$126 million in 2020, primarily due to lower\ncosts\nassociated with compensation and benefits,\nincluding mark to market impacts of certain\nkey employee\ncompensation programs.\nExploration expenses increased $714 million\nin 2020, primarily due to an $828 million before-tax\nimpairment\nfor the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs related to our Alaska\nNorth Slope Gas\nasset.\nPartly offsetting this increase, was the absence of\na $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment\nexpense due to our decision to discontinue exploration\nactivities in the Central Louisiana Austin\nChalk trend.\nFor additional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairments increased $408 million in\n2020, primarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets\nwhich were written down to fair value due to lower\ncommodity prices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $199 million in 2020, primarily due\nto lower commodity prices and\nvolumes.\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased\n$138 million in 2020, due to gains recognized\nfrom\nforeign currency derivatives and other foreign\ncurrency remeasurements.\nFor additional information, see Note\n13-Derivative and Financial Instruments\nin the

2019,\nprimarily due to:\n\u25cf\nNormal field decline.\n\u25cf\nThe divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the\nsecond quarter of 2020.\n\u25cf\nProduction curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED,\nprimarily from North American operated\nassets and Malaysia, in response to the low crude\noil price environment.\n\u25cf\nLess production in Libya due to the forced shutdown\nof the Es Sider export terminal and other\neastern\nexport terminals after a period of civil unrest.\nThe decrease in production during 2020 was partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nNew wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway, Alaska and China.\nProduction excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED and closed acquisitions\nand dispositions, production for 2020 would\nhave been\n1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared\nwith 2019.\nThis decrease was primarily due to normal\nfield decline, partly offset by new wells online in the\nLower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China.\nProduction from Libya averaged 9 MBOED as it\nwas in force majeure during

capital*\n%\nPercent of floating-rate debt to total debt\n%\n*Capital includes total debt and total equity.\nTo meet our short-\nand long-term liquidity requirements, we look\nto a variety of funding sources, including\ncash generated from operating activities,\nproceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper\nand credit facility\nprograms and our ability to sell securities\nusing our shelf registration statement.\nIn 2020, the primary uses of\nour available cash were $4,715 million to support\nour ongoing capital expenditures and investments\nprogram;\n$1,831 million to pay dividends on our common\nstock; $892 million to repurchase our common\nstock; and\n$658 million for net purchase of investments.\nDuring 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased\nby $2,097\nmillion to $2,991 million.\nWe entered the year with a strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents\nof over $5 billion, short-\nterm investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn\ncredit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately\n$14 billion\nin available liquidity.\nThis strong foundation allowed us to be measured\nin our response to the sudden change\nin business environment as we exited the first\nquarter of 2020.\nIn response to the oil market downturn\nthat\nbegan in early 2020,\nwe announced the following capital, share repurchase\nand operating cost reductions. We\nreduced our 2020 operating plan capital expenditures\nby a total of $2.3 billion, or approximately\nthirty-five\npercent of the original guidance.\nWe suspended our share repurchase program, further reducing cash outlays\nby approximately $2 billion.\nWe also reduced our operating costs by approximately $0.6 billion,\nor roughly\nten percent of the original 2020 guidance.\nCollectively, these actions represent a reduction in 2020 cash uses of\napproximately $5 billion versus the original operating\nplan.\nConsidering the weakness in oil prices during the\nsecond quarter of 2020, we established a framework\nfor\nevaluating and implementing economic curtailments,\nwhich resulted in taking an additional significant\nstep of\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nBased on our economic criteria, we began\nrestoring production\nfrom voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil prices stabilizing around $40 per\nbarrel, we ended our\ncurtailment program by the end of the third quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed\nshare repurchases, repurchasing $0.2 billion\nof shares in October,\nbefore suspending our share repurchase program\nupon entry into a definitive agreement to\nacquire Concho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho\nacquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2020,\nwe had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion,\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion, and available borrowing capacity under\nour credit facility of $5.7 billion, totaling\nover $12 billion of\nliquidity.\nWe believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external\nsources of funds as described below in the Significant\nChanges in Capital\u201d section, will be sufficient\nto meet\nour funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including\nour capital spending program, dividend\npayments and required debt payments.\nSignificant Changes in Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2020, cash provided by operating activities\nwas $4,802 million, a 57 percent decrease from 2019.\nThe\ndecrease was primarily due to lower realized\ncommodity prices, normal field decline,\nproduction curtailments,\nthe divestiture of our U.K.\nand Australia-West assets, and the absence in 2020 of collections under our\nsettlement agreement with PDVSA,\npartially offset by lower production and operating\nexpenses.\nOur short-\nand long-term operating cash flows are highly\ndependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, LNG and NGLs.\nPrices and margins in our industry have historically\nbeen volatile and are driven by\nmarket conditions over which we have no control.\nAbsent other mitigating factors, as these\nprices and margins\nfluctuate, we would expect a corresponding\nchange in our operating cash flows.\nThe level of absolute production volumes, as\nwell as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.\nFull-\nyear production averaged 1,127 MBOED in 2020.\nFull-year production excluding Libya averaged\n1,118\nMBOED in 2020.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately\n80 MBOED;\nclosed acquisitions and\ndispositions;\nand excluding Libya; production for 2020 was 1,176 MBOED.\nProduction in 2021 is expected to\nbe approximately 1.5 MMBOED, reflecting the\nimpact from the Concho acquisition.\nFuture production is\nsubject to numerous uncertainties, including,\namong others, the volatile crude oil and\nnatural gas price\nenvironment, which may impact investment decisions;\nthe effects of price changes on production sharing\nand\nvariable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition\nof fields; field production decline rates; new\ntechnologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups\nand major turnarounds; political instability;\nweather-\nrelated disruptions; and the addition of proved\nreserves through exploratory success and\ntheir timely and cost-\neffective development.\nWhile we actively manage these factors,\nproduction levels can cause variability in cash\nflows, although generally this variability\nhas not been as significant as that caused by commodity\nprices.\nTo maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue\nto add to our proved\nreserve base.\nOur proved reserves generally increase as prices\nrise and decrease as prices decline.\nReserve\nreplacement represents the net change in proved\nreserves, net of production, divided by our current\nyear\nproduction, as shown in our supplemental reserve table\ndisclosures.\nOur reserve replacement was negative 86\npercent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower\nprices, which reduced reserves by approximately\n600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas\nnegative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, reflecting the impact\nof\nlower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended December 31, 2020,\nwhich excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related\nto sales and purchases, was 53 percent.\nFor additional information about our 2021 capital\nbudget, see the 2021 Capital Budget\u201d section\nwithin\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\u201d and for additional\ninformation on proved reserves, including both\ndeveloped and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil\nand Gas Operations\u201d section of this report.\nAs discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d\nsection, engineering estimates of proved\nreserves are\nimprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised\nupward or downward due to the impact of changes\nin\ncommodity prices or as more technical data becomes\navailable on reservoirs.\nIt is not possible to reliably\npredict how revisions will impact reserve quantities\nin the future.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2020, we invested $4.7 billion in capital\nexpenditures, of which $0.5 billion consisted of\nstrategic\nacquisitions, including additional Montney acreage.\nCapital expenditures invested in 2019 and 2018\nwere $6.6\nbillion and $6.8 billion,\nrespectively.\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\u201d\nsection.\nWe invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is\nto protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide\nyield and total returns;\nthese investments include time\ndeposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities\nclassified as available for sale.\nFunds for short-term\nneeds to support our operating plan and provide resiliency\nto react to short-term price volatility are invested\nin\nhighly liquid instruments with maturities within\nthe year.\nFunds we consider available to maintain resiliency\nin longer term price downturns and to capture\nopportunities outside a given operating\nplan may be invested in\ninstruments with maturities greater than one year.\nFor additional information, see Note 1-Accounting\nPolicies\nand Note 13-Derivative and Financial Instruments,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nInvesting activities in 2020 included net purchases\nof $658 million of investments,\nof which $420 million was\ninvested in short-term instruments and $238 million\nwas invested in long-term instruments.\nInvesting\nactivities in 2019 included net purchases of $2.9\nbillion of investments,\nof which $2.8 billion was invested in\nshort-term instruments and $0.1 billion was invested\nin long-term instruments.\nFor additional information, see\nNote 13-Derivative and Financial Instruments,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nProceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion.\nWe received cash proceeds of $765 million for the\ndivestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations,\nwith another $200 million payment due upon final\ninvestment decision of the proposed Barossa\ndevelopment project.\nWe also received proceeds of $359 million\nand $184 million for the sale of our Niobrara interests\nand Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48,\nrespectively.\nProceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion,\nincluding $2.2 billion for the sale of\ntwo ConocoPhillips\nU.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for\nthe sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater\nSunrise Fields.\nProceeds from assets sales in 2018 were $1.1\nbillion, including several non-core assets in\nthe Lower 48, as\nwell as the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary\nwhich held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest\nin the Clair\nField in the U.K.\nFor additional information on our dispositions,\nsee Note 4-Asset Acquisitions and\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nFinancing Activities\nWe have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023.\nOur revolving credit facility\nmay be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance\nof letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as\nsupport for our commercial paper program.\nThe revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated\namong financial\ninstitutions and does not contain any material\nadverse change provisions or any covenants\nrequiring\nmaintenance of specified financial ratios or credit\nratings.\nThe facility agreement contains a cross-default\nprovision relating to the failure to pay principal or\ninterest on other debt obligations of\n$200 million or more\nby ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe amount of the facility is not subject to\nthe\nredetermination prior to its expiration date.\nCredit facility borrowings may bear interest at\na margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the\nLondon interbank market or at a margin above the overnight\nfederal funds rate or prime rates offered by\ncertain designated banks in the U.S.\nThe agreement calls for commitment fees\non available, but unused,\namounts.\nThe agreement also contains early termination\nrights if our current directors or their approved\nsuccessors cease to be a majority of the Board\nof Directors.\nThe revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips\nCompany's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of\ncommercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term\nworking capital needs.\nCommercial\npaper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.\nWith $300 million of commercial paper outstanding and no\ndirect borrowings or letters of credit,\nwe had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity\nunder the revolving\ncredit facility at December 31, 2020.\nWe may consider issuing additional commercial paper in the future to\nsupplement our cash position.\nIn October 2020, Moody's affirmed its rating of our senior long-term debt of A3\u201d\nwith a stable\u201d outlook, and\naffirmed its rating of our short-term debt as Prime-2.\u201d\nIn January 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-\nterm debt as A\u201d with a stable\u201d outlook and affirmed its\nrating of our short-term debt as +.\u201d\nOn January\n25, 2021, S&P revised the industry risk assessment\nfor the E&P industry to \u2018Moderately High' from\n\u2018Intermediate' based on a view of increasing\nrisks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker\nprofitability.\nOn February 11, 2021, S&P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt\nfrom A\u201d to A-\u201d with a\nstable\u201d outlook and downgraded its rating of our short-term\ndebt from A-1\u201d to A-2.\u201d\nWe do not have any\nratings triggers on any of our corporate debt\nthat would cause an automatic default, and\nthereby impact our\naccess to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.\nIf our credit ratings\nare downgraded from their\ncurrent levels, it could increase the cost of corporate\ndebt available to us and restrict our access to\nthe\ncommercial paper markets.\nIf our credit rating were to deteriorate\nto a level prohibiting us from accessing the\ncommercial paper market, we would still\nbe able to access funds under our revolving credit\nfacility.\nCertain of our project-related contracts, commercial\ncontracts and derivative instruments contain\nprovisions\nrequiring us to post collateral.\nMany of these contracts and instruments permit\nus to post either cash or letters\nof credit as collateral.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had direct\nbank letters of credit of $249 million\nand $277 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to\nvarious purchase\ncommitments incident to the ordinary conduct of\nbusiness.\nIn the event of credit\nratings downgrades, we may\nbe required to post additional letters of\ncredit.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition,\nwe assumed Concho's publicly traded debt.\nOn December 7, 2020, we launched an offer to exchange\nConcho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips.\nThe exchange offer settled on February 8,\n2021.\nOf the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate\nprincipal amount of Concho's notes subject to the\nexchange offer, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered and\nexchanged for new debt issued by\nConocoPhillips.\nThere were no impacts to ConocoPhillips'\ncredit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.\nFor\nadditional information,\nsee Note 10-Debt and Note 25-Acquisition\nof Concho Resources Inc., in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShelf Registration\nWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which\nwe have the ability to issue\nand sell an indeterminate amount of various types\nof debt and equity securities.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nWe have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company\nand Burlington Resources\nLLC, with respect to publicly held debt securities.\nConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent\nowned by\nConocoPhillips.\nBurlington Resources LLC is 100 percent\nowned by ConocoPhillips Company.\nConocoPhillips and/or ConocoPhillips Company\nhave fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nthe payment\nobligations of Burlington Resources LLC, with respect\nto its publicly held debt securities.\nSimilarly,\nConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips\nCompany\nwith respect to its publicly held debt securities.\nIn addition, ConocoPhillips Company\nhas fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations\nof ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly\nheld debt\nsecurities.\nAll guarantees are joint and several.\nIn March of 2020, the SEC adopted amendments\nto simplify the financial disclosure requirements\nfor\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nregistered under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X.\nBased on our\nevaluation of our existing guarantee relationships,\nwe qualify for the transition to alternative disclosures.\nWe\nelected early voluntary compliance with the final\namendments beginning in the third quarter\nof 2020.\nAccordingly, condensed consolidating information by guarantor and issuer of\nguaranteed securities will no\nlonger be reported, and alternative disclosures\nof summarized financial information for the\nconsolidated\nObligor Group is presented.\nThe following tables present summarized financial\ninformation for the Obligor\nGroup, as defined below:\n\u25cf\nThe Obligor Group will reflect guarantors and issuers\nof guaranteed securities consisting of\nConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and\nBurlington Resources LLC.\n\u25cf\nConsolidating adjustments for elimination\nof investments in and transactions between the collective\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nare reflected in the balances of the summarized\nfinancial information.\n\u25cf\nNon-Obligated Subsidiaries are excluded\nfrom this presentation.\nTransactions and balances reflecting activity between the Obligors\nand Non-Obligated Subsidiaries are\npresented separately below:\nSummarized Income Statement Data\nMillions of Dollars\nRevenues and Other Income\n$\n8,375\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(2,999)\nNet income (loss)\n(2,701)\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips\n(2,701)\nSummarized Balance Sheet Data\nMillions of Dollars\nDecember 31, 2020\nCurrent assets\n$\n8,535\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\nNoncurrent assets\n37,180\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n7,730\nCurrent liabilities\n3,797\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\n1,365\nNoncurrent liabilities\n18,627\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n3,972\nCapital Requirements\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the Capital Expenditures\nand\nInvestments\u201d\nsection.\nOur debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15,369\nmillion, an increase of $474 million from\nthe balance at\nDecember 31, 2019.\nMaturities of debt (including payments for\nfinance leases) due in 2021 of $601 million,\nexcluding net unamortized premiums and discounts,\nwill be paid from current cash balances and cash\ngenerated by operations.\nFor more information on Debt, see Note 10-Debt,\nin the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing and sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by\nadditional returns of capital, including share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid $1,831 million, $1.69 per share of\ncommon stock, in dividends. This is an increase\nover 2019 and 2018, when we paid $1.34 and\n$1.16 per share\nof common stock, respectively.\nIn February 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend\nof $0.43 per share,\npayable March 1, 2021, to stockholders of record\nat the close of business on February 12, 2021.\nIn late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase\nprogram, which has a current total program\nauthorization of $25 billion of our common stock.\nCost of share repurchases were $892 million,\n$3,500\nmillion and $2,999 million in 2020, 2019 and\n2018,\nrespectively.\nShare repurchases since inception of our\ncurrent program totaled 189\nmillion shares at a cost of $10,517 million, as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nIn the\nfourth quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchases\nupon entry into a definitive agreement\nto acquire\nConcho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after the completion of our Concho acquisition.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices,\nsubject to market conditions and other\nfactors.\nOur dividend and share repurchase programs are\nsubject to numerous considerations, including\nmarket\nconditions, management discretion and other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors\n-\nOur ability to declare and\npay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to\ncertain considerations.\u201d\nIn addition to the requirements above, we have contractual\nobligations for the purchase of goods and services\nof approximately $8,123 million.\nWe expect to fulfill $2,805 million of these obligations in 2021. These\nfigures exclude purchase commitments\nfor jointly owned fields and facilities where\nwe are not the operator.\nPurchase obligations of $5,237 million\nare related to agreements to access and utilize\nthe capacity of third-\nparty equipment and facilities, including pipelines\nand LNG product terminals, to transport, process,\ntreat and\nstore commodities.\nPurchase obligations of $2,290

announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of $5.5\nbillion.\nThe\nplan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for investment\nin major projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nFor information on PUDs and the associated costs\nto develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas\nOperations\u201d\nsection in this report.\nContingencies\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims\narising in the ordinary course of business\nhave been filed\nagainst ConocoPhillips.\nWe also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the\nplacement, storage, disposal or release of certain\nchemical, mineral and petroleum substances\nat various active\nand inactive sites.\nWe regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these\ncontingencies.\nIn the case of all known contingencies (other\nthan those related to income taxes), we accrue\na\nliability when the loss is probable and the amount\nis reasonably estimable.\nIf a range of amounts can be\nreasonably estimated and no amount within the range\nis a better estimate than any other amount,\nthen the low\nend of the range is accrued.\nWe do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.\nWe accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable.\nWith respect to income\ntax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted\nloss accrual in cases where sustaining a\ntax position is less than certain.\nBased on currently available information, we believe\nit is remote that future costs related to known\ncontingent\nliability exposures will exceed current accruals by\nan amount that would have a material\nadverse impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nFor information on other contingencies, see\nCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters\ninvolving oil and gas royalty\nand severance tax payments, gas measurement and\nvaluation methods, contract disputes,\nenvironmental\ndamages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.\nOur primary exposures for such matters\nrelate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments\non certain federal, state and privately owned\nproperties and\nclaims of alleged environmental contamination\nfrom historic operations.\nWe will continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience\nand professional judgment to the specific\ncharacteristics of our cases, employing a litigation\nmanagement process to manage and monitor the\nlegal\nproceedings against us.\nOur process facilitates the early evaluation and\nquantification of potential exposures in\nindividual cases.\nThis process also enables us to track those cases that\nhave been scheduled for trial and/or\nmediation.\nBased on professional judgment and experience\nin using these litigation management tools and\navailable information about current developments\nin all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses\nthe\nadequacy of current accruals and determines if\nadjustment of existing accruals, or establishment\nof new\naccruals, is required.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor\nadditional information about income tax-related\ncontingencies.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental\nlaws and

regulations,\nwhich relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S.\nwaters and impose liability for the cost of pollution\ncleanup resulting from operations, as well as\npotential liability for pollution damages.\n\u25cf\nEuropean Union Trading Directive resulting in European\nEmissions Trading Scheme.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations\nset limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to\nwater,\nestablish water quality limits and establish standards\nand impose obligations for the remediation\nof releases of\nhazardous substances and hazardous wastes.\nThey also, in most cases, require permits in\nassociation with new\nor modified operations.\nThese permits can require an applicant to\ncollect substantial information in connection\nwith the application process, which can be expensive\nand time consuming.\nIn addition, there can be delays\nassociated with notice and comment periods and\nthe agency's processing of the application.\nMany of the\ndelays associated with the permitting process\nare beyond the control of the applicant.\nMany states and foreign countries where\nwe operate also have, or are developing, similar\nenvironmental laws\nand regulations governing these same types of\nactivities.\nWhile similar, in some cases these regulations may\nimpose additional, or more stringent, requirements\nthat can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing\nor\ntransporting products across state and international\nborders.\nThe ultimate financial impact arising from\nenvironmental laws and regulations is neither\nclearly known nor\neasily determinable as new standards, such as\nair emission standards and water quality standards,\ncontinue to\nevolve.\nHowever, environmental laws and regulations, including those that\nmay arise to address concerns\nabout global climate change, are expected to continue\nto have an increasing impact on our operations\nin the\nU.S. and in other countries in which we operate.\nNotable areas of potential impacts include air emission\ncompliance and remediation obligations in\nthe U.S. and Canada.\nAn example is the use of hydraulic fracturing,\nan essential completion technique that facilitates\nproduction of\noil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower\npermeability rock formations.\nA range of local, state, federal or\nnational laws and regulations currently govern\nhydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic\nfracturing\ncurrently prohibited in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic fracturing has been conducted\nfor many\ndecades, a number of new laws, regulations\nand permitting requirements are under consideration\nby various\nstate environmental agencies, and others which\ncould result in increased costs, operating restrictions,\noperational delays and/or limit the ability\nto develop oil and natural gas resources.\nGovernmental restrictions\non hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall\nprofitability or viability of certain of our oil\nand natural gas\ninvestments.\nWe have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards\ndesigned to\nmeet or exceed government requirements.\nOur practices continually evolve as technology\nimproves and\nregulations change.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation\nobligations\nassociated with current and past operations.\nSuch laws and regulations include CERCLA\nand RCRA and their\nstate equivalents.\nLonger-term expenditures are subject to considerable\nuncertainty and may fluctuate\nsignificantly.\nWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability\nfrom the EPA and state\nenvironmental agencies alleging we are a potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent\nstate\nstatute.\nOn occasion, we also have been made a party\nto cost recovery litigation by those agencies\nor by\nprivate parties.\nThese requests, notices and lawsuits assert\npotential liability for remediation costs at various\nsites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly\ncontain wastes attributable to our past operations.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, there were 15 sites around\nthe U.S. in which we were identified as\na potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA and comparable\nstate laws.\nFor most Superfund sites, our potential liability\nwill be significantly less than the total site\nremediation costs\nbecause the percentage of waste attributable\nto us, versus that attributable to all other\npotentially responsible\nparties, is relatively low.\nAlthough liability of those potentially\nresponsible is generally joint and several for\nfederal sites and frequently so for state sites,\nother potentially responsible parties at sites\nwhere we are a party\ntypically have had the financial strength to\nmeet their obligations, and where they have\nnot, or where\npotentially responsible parties could not be located,\nour share of liability has not increased materially.\nMany of\nthe sites at which we are potentially responsible\nare still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies\nconcerned.\nPrior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible\nnormally assess site conditions, apportion\nresponsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.\nIn some instances, we may have no liability\nor attain\na settlement of liability.\nActual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties\nobtain EPA or equivalent state\nagency approval.\nThere are relatively few sites where we\nare a major participant, and given the timing\nand\namounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the\ncost of remediation at those sites nor\nsuch costs at all\nCERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to\nhave a material adverse effect on our competitive\nor financial\ncondition.\nExpensed environmental costs were $393 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about $435 million\nper year\nin 2021 and 2022.\nCapitalized environmental costs were $161 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about\n$210 million per year in 2021 and 2022.\nAccrued liabilities for remediation activities\nare not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers\nor other\nthird parties and are not discounted (except those\nassumed in a purchase business combination,\nwhich we do\nrecord on a discounted basis).\nMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA,\nRCRA and similar state or international laws that\nrequire us to\nundertake certain investigative and remedial\nactivities at sites where we conduct, or once\nconducted,\noperations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated\nwaste was disposed.\nThe accrual also includes a number\nof sites we identified that may require environmental\nremediation, but which are not currently the\nsubject of\nCERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement\nactivities.\nThe laws that require or address environmental\nremediation may apply retroactively and regardless\nof fault, the legality of the original activities\nor the current\nownership or control of sites.\nIf applicable, we accrue receivables for probable\ninsurance or other third-party\nrecoveries.\nIn the future, we may incur significant costs\nunder both CERCLA and RCRA.\nRemediation activities vary substantially\nin duration and cost from site to site, depending on the\nmix of unique\nsite characteristics, evolving remediation technologies,\ndiverse regulatory agencies and enforcement\npolicies,\nand the presence or absence of potentially liable\nthird parties.\nTherefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable\nestimates of future site remediation costs.\nAt December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included\ntotal accrued environmental costs of\n$180 million,\ncompared with $171 million at December 31,\n2019, for remediation activities in the\nU.S. and Canada.\nWe\nexpect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures\nwithin the next 30 years.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as\nwith other companies engaged in similar businesses,\nenvironmental costs and liabilities are inherent\nconcerns in our operations and products, and there\ncan be no\nassurance that material costs and liabilities\nwill not be incurred.\nHowever, we currently do not expect any\nmaterial adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial\nposition as a result of compliance with\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nContinuing political and social attention to the\nissue of global climate change has resulted in a broad\nrange of\nproposed or promulgated state, national and international\nlaws focusing on GHG reduction.\nThese proposed or\npromulgated laws apply or could apply in countries\nwhere we have interests or may have interests\nin the future.\nLaws in this field continue to evolve, and\nwhile it is not possible to accurately estimate either\na timetable for\nimplementation or our future compliance costs\nrelating to implementation, such laws, if\nenacted, could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nExamples of legislation and precursors\nfor possible regulation that do or could affect our operations\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEuropean Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through\nwhich many of the EU member\nstates are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.\nOur cost of compliance with the EU ETS in\n2020 was\napproximately $7 million before-tax.\n\u25cf\nThe Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation\nrequires any existing\nfacility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000\nmetric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent,\nper year to meet a facility benchmark intensity.\nThe total cost of these regulations in 2020\nwas\napproximately $2 million.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts\nv. EPA\n,\n549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007),\nconfirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant\u201d\nunder the\nFederal Clean Air Act.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on March 29, 2010 (published\nas Interpretation of Regulations that\nDetermine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act\nPermitting Programs,\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April\n2,\n2010)), and the EPA's\nand U.S. Department of Transportation's joint promulgation of a Final Rule on\nApril 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs\nunder the Clean Air Act, may trigger more\nclimate-\nbased claims for damages, and may result in longer\nagency review time for development projects.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on January 14, 2015, outlining\na series of steps it plans to take to\naddress methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound\nemissions from the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe U.S. government established a goal of\nreducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions\nfrom the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent\nby 2025.\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.\nOur cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon\ntax legislation\nin 2020 was approximately $29 million (net\nshare before-tax).\nWe also incur a carbon tax for\nemissions from fossil fuel combustion in our\nBritish Columbia and Alberta operations in\nCanada,\ntotaling approximately $3.5 million (net share\nbefore-tax).\n\u25cf\nThe agreement reached in Paris in December 2015\nat the 21\nst\nConference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, setting out a process for achieving\nglobal\nemission reductions.\nThe new administration has recommitted\nthe United States to the Paris\nAgreement, and a significant number of U.S. state\nand local governments and major corporations\nheadquartered in the U.S. have also announced\nrelated commitments.\nIn the U.S., some additional form of regulation\nmay be forthcoming in the future at the\nfederal and state levels\nwith respect to GHG emissions.\nSuch regulation could take any of several\nforms that may result in the creation\nof additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction\nof output, investments of capital to maintain\ncompliance\nwith laws and regulations, or required acquisition\nor trading of emission allowances.\nWe are working to\ncontinuously improve operational and energy efficiency through\nresource and energy conservation throughout\nour operations.\nCompliance with changes in laws and regulations\nthat create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme\nor GHG\nreduction policies could significantly increase\nour costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived\nproducts,\nimpact the cost and availability of capital\nand increase our exposure to litigation.\nSuch laws and regulations\ncould also increase demand for less carbon intensive\nenergy sources, including natural gas.\nThe ultimate\nimpact on our financial performance, either positive\nor negative, will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding\nbut not limited to:\n\u25cf\nWhether and to what extent legislation or\nregulation is enacted.\n\u25cf\nThe timing of the introduction of such legislation\nor regulation.\n\u25cf\nThe nature of the legislation (such as a cap and\ntrade system or a tax on emissions) or\nregulation.\n\u25cf\nThe price placed on GHG emissions (either\nby the market or through a tax).\n\u25cf\nThe GHG reductions required.\n\u25cf\nThe price and availability of offsets.\n\u25cf\nThe amount and allocation of allowances.\n\u25cf\nTechnological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.\n\u25cf\nAny potential significant physical effects of climate\nchange (such as increased severe weather events,\nchanges in sea levels and changes in temperature).\n\u25cf\nWhether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are\nultimately reflected in the prices of\nour products and services.\nClimate Change Litigation\nBeginning in 2017, governmental and other entities\nin several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits\nagainst oil\nand gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages and equitable\nrelief to abate\nalleged climate change impacts.\nAdditional lawsuits with similar allegations\nare expected to be filed.\nThe\namounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal\nand factual issues involved in these cases are\nunprecedented.\nConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are\nfactually and legally meritless and are an\ninappropriate vehicle to address the challenges\nassociated with climate change and will\nvigorously defend\nagainst such lawsuits.\nSeveral Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana\nhave filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana's State and Local\nCoastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA)\nagainst oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages for contamination\nand erosion of the Louisiana coastline\nallegedly caused by\nhistorical oil and gas operations.\nConocoPhillips entities are defendants\nin 22 of the lawsuits and will\nvigorously defend against them.\nBecause Plaintiffs' SLCRMA theories are unprecedented,\nthere is uncertainty\nabout these claims (both as to scope and damages)\nand any potential financial impact on the company.\nCompany Response to Climate-Related Risks\nThe company has responded by putting in place\na Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard\ncovering the assessment and registering of significant\nand high sustainable development risks based\non their\nconsequence and likelihood of occurrence.\nWe have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan\nwith the goal of tracking mitigation activities\nfor each climate-related risk included in the corporate\nSustainable Development Risk Register.\nThe risks addressed in our Climate Change Action\nPlan fall into four broad categories:\n\u25cf\nGHG-related legislation and regulation.\n\u25cf\nGHG emissions management.\n\u25cf\nPhysical climate-related impacts.\n\u25cf\nClimate-related disclosure and reporting.\nEmissions are categorized into three different scopes.\nGross operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions\nhelp us understand our climate transition\nrisk.\n\u25cf\nScope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions\nfrom sources that we own or control.\n\u25cf\nScope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from\nthe generation of purchased electricity or\nsteam that we\nconsume.\nScope 3 emissions are indirect emissions\nfrom sources that we neither own nor control.\nWe announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework\nwith the objective of\nimplementing a coherent set of choices designed\nto facilitate the success of our existing exploration\nand\nproduction business through the energy transition.\nGiven the uncertainties remaining about how the\nenergy\ntransition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust\nacross a range of potential future outcomes.\nThe strategy is comprised of four pillars:\n\u25cf\nTargets:\nOur target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term\nambition that sets\nthe direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions\nintensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These\nperformance\ntargets are supported by lower-level internal business\nunit goals to enable the company to achieve the\ncompany-wide targets.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions\nintensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by\n2030, with an ambition to achieve net-zero\noperated\nemissions by 2050.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to work towards\nzero routine\nflaring of gas by 2030.\n\u25cf\nTechnology choices:\nWe expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader\nrange of opportunities for emission reduction\ntechnology.\n\u25cf\nPortfolio choices:\nOur corporate authorization process requires\nall qualifying projects to include a\nGHG price in their project approval economics.\nDifferent GHG prices are used depending on the\nregion or jurisdiction.\nProjects in jurisdictions with existing GHG\npricing regimes incorporate the\nexisting GHG price and forecast into their\neconomics.\nProjects where no existing GHG pricing\nregime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our\ninternally consistent World Energy Model.\nIn this\nway, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.\nThe\ncompany does not use an estimated market cost\nof GHG emissions when assessing reserves\nin\njurisdictions without existing GHG regulations.\n\u25cf\nExternal engagement: Our external engagement\naims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and\ngas sector with our approach to managing climate-related\nrisk.\nWe are a Founding Member of the\nClimate Leadership Council (CLC), an international\npolicy institute founded in collaboration\nwith\nbusiness and environmental interests to develop\na carbon dividend plan.\nParticipation in the CLC\nprovides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue\nabout carbon pricing and framing the issues\nin\nalignment with our public policy principles.\nWe also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon\nDividends, the education and advocacy branch of\nthe CLC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management\nto select appropriate\naccounting policies and to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses.\nSee Note 1-Accounting Policies, in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for descriptions of our major accounting\npolicies.\nCertain of these accounting policies involve\njudgments and uncertainties to such an extent there\nis a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts\nwould have been reported under different conditions, or if\ndifferent assumptions had been used.\nThese critical\naccounting estimates are discussed with the Audit\nand Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at\nleast\nannually.\nWe believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along\nwith the discussion of\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowances in this\nreport, address all important accounting\nareas where the nature\nof accounting estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary\nto\naccount for highly uncertain matters or the\nsusceptibility of such matters to change.\nOil and Gas Accounting\nAccounting for oil and gas exploratory activity\nis subject to special accounting rules unique\nto the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe acquisition of G&G seismic information,\nprior to the discovery of proved reserves, is\nexpensed\nas incurred, similar to accounting for research and\ndevelopment costs.\nHowever, leasehold acquisition costs\nand exploratory well costs are capitalized on the\nbalance sheet pending determination of whether\nproved oil\nand gas reserves have been recognized.\nProperty Acquisition Costs\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management\nperiodically assesses for impairment based on\nexploration\nand drilling efforts to date.\nFor relatively small individual leasehold acquisition\ncosts, management exercises\njudgment and determines a percentage probability\nthat the prospect ultimately will fail to find\nproved oil and\ngas reserves and pools that leasehold information\nwith others in the geographic area.\nFor prospects in areas\nwith limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling,\nthe percentage probability of ultimate failure\nis normally\njudged to be quite high.\nThis judgmental percentage is multiplied\nby the leasehold acquisition cost, and that\nproduct is divided by the contractual period\nof the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold\nimpairment\ncharge that is reported in exploration expense.\nThis judgmental probability percentage is reassessed\nand\nadjusted throughout the contractual period of the\nleasehold based on favorable or unfavorable\nexploratory\nactivity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds,\nand leasehold impairment amortization expense is\nadjusted\nprospectively.\nAt year-end 2020, the remaining $2.4 billion of net capitalized\nunproved property costs consisted primarily\nof\nindividually significant leaseholds, mineral rights\nheld in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory\nwells\ncurrently being drilled, suspended exploratory\nwells, and capitalized interest.\nOf this amount, approximately\n$1.9 billion is concentrated in 10 major development\nareas, the majority of which are not expected to\nmove to\nproved properties in 2021.\nManagement periodically assesses individually\nsignificant leaseholds for\nimpairment based on the results of exploration\nand drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\nExploratory Costs\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily\ncapitalized, or suspended,\u201d on the balance sheet,\npending\na determination of whether potentially economic\noil and gas reserves have been discovered by the\ndrilling\neffort to justify development.\nIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic\nquantities of oil and gas, the well costs\nremain capitalized\non the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing\nthe reserves and the economic and operating\nviability of the project is being made.\nThe accounting notion of sufficient progress\u201d is\na judgmental area, but\nthe accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization\nof suspended well costs on the expectation\nfuture\nmarket conditions will improve or new technologies\nwill be found that would make the development\neconomically profitable.\nOften, the ability to move into the development\nphase and record proved reserves is\ndependent on obtaining permits and government\nor co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is\nultimately\nbeyond our control.\nExploratory well costs remain suspended as long\nas we are actively pursuing such\napprovals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.\nOnce all required approvals and permits have\nbeen\nobtained, the projects are moved into the development\nphase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated\nas\nproved reserves.\nFor complex exploratory discoveries, it\nis not unusual to have exploratory wells remain\nsuspended on the balance sheet for several\nyears while we perform additional appraisal\ndrilling and seismic\nwork on the potential oil and gas field or while\nwe seek government or co-venturer approval of development\nplans or seek environmental permitting.\nOnce a determination is made the well did not\nencounter potentially\neconomic oil and gas quantities, the well costs\nare expensed as a dry hole and reported in\nexploration expense.\nManagement reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors\nthe results of the additional\nappraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses\nthe suspended well costs as a dry hole when it\ndetermines\nthe potential field does not warrant further\ninvestment in the near term.\nCriteria utilized in making this\ndetermination include evaluation of the reservoir\ncharacteristics and hydrocarbon properties,\nexpected\ndevelopment costs, ability to apply existing technology\nto produce the reserves, fiscal terms,\nregulations or\ncontract negotiations, and our expected return\non investment.\nAt year-end 2020,\ntotal suspended well costs were $682 million,\ncompared with $1,020 million at year-end\n2019.\nFor additional information on suspended wells,\nincluding an aging analysis, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProved Reserves\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves\nare inherently imprecise and represent only\napproximate amounts because of the judgments involved\nin developing such information.\nReserve estimates\nare based on geological and engineering assessments\nof in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production\nplan,\nhistorical extraction recovery and processing yield\nfactors, installed plant operating capacity\nand approved\noperating limits.\nThe reliability of these estimates at any point\nin time depends on both the quality and\nquantity of the technical and economic data\nand the efficiency of extracting and processing the\nhydrocarbons.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering\nestimates, accounting rules require disclosure\nof\nproved\u201d reserve estimates due to the importance\nof these estimates to better understand the perceived\nvalue\nand future cash flows of a company's operations.\nThere are several authoritative guidelines\nregarding the\nengineering criteria that must be met before estimated\nreserves can be designated as proved.\u201d\nOur\ngeosciences and reservoir engineering organization\nhas policies and procedures in place consistent\nwith these\nauthoritative guidelines.\nWe have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate\nour\nproved reserves held by consolidated companies, as\nwell as our share of equity affiliates.\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually\nin the fourth quarter and during the year\nif significant changes\noccur, and take into account recent production and subsurface\ninformation about each field.\nAlso, as required\nby current authoritative guidelines, the estimated\nfuture date when an asset will reach the end\nof its economic\nlife is based on 12-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will end and\naffects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the\nestimate of proved reserves also changes.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and\nincrease as prices rise.\nOur proved reserves include estimated quantities\nrelated to PSCs, reported under the economic interest\u201d\nmethod, as well as variable-royalty regimes,\nand are subject to fluctuations in commodity\nprices; recoverable\noperating expenses; and capital costs.\nIf costs remain stable, reserve quantities\nattributable to recovery of costs\nwill change inversely to changes in commodity\nprices.\nWe would expect reserves from these contracts to\ndecrease when product prices rise and increase\nwhen prices decline.\nThe estimation of proved developed reserves also\nis important to the income statement because\nthe proved\ndeveloped reserve estimate for a field serves as the\ndenominator in the unit-of-production\ncalculation of the\nDD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset.\nAt year-end 2020, the net book value of productive PP&E\nsubject to a unit-of-production calculation was\napproximately $33 billion and the DD&A recorded\non these\nassets in 2020 was approximately $5.3 billion.\nThe estimated proved developed reserves for\nour consolidated\noperations were 3.2 billion BOE at the end\nof 2019 and 2.5 billion BOE at the end of\n2020.\nIf the estimates of\nproved reserves used in the unit-of-production\ncalculations had been lower by 10 percent\nacross all\ncalculations, before-tax DD&A in 2020\nwould have increased by an estimated $588\nmillion.\nImpairments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed\nfor impairment whenever changes in facts\nand circumstances\nindicate a possible significant deterioration\nin future cash flows expected to be generated\nby an asset group.\nIf\nthere is an indication the carrying amount of\nan asset may not be recovered, a recoverability\ntest is performed\nusing management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development\nplans.\nIf, upon review, the sum\nof the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes\nis less than the carrying value of the asset\ngroup, the\ncarrying value is written down to estimated fair\nvalue and reported as impairments in the\nperiods in which the\ndetermination is made.\nIndividual assets are grouped for impairment\npurposes at the lowest level for which\nthere are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent\nof the cash flows of other groups of assets-\ngenerally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets.\nBecause there usually is a lack of quoted\nmarket prices for\nlong-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets\nis typically determined based on the present\nvalues of\nexpected future cash flows using discount rates\nand prices believed to be consistent with\nthose used by\nprincipal market participants,\nor based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated\nwith historical market\ntransactions of similar assets where possible.\nThe expected future cash flows used for\nimpairment reviews and\nrelated fair value calculations are based on estimated\nfuture production volumes, commodity\nprices, operating\ncosts and capital decisions, considering all\navailable information at the date of review.\nDiffering assumptions\ncould affect the timing and the amount of an impairment\nin any period.\nSee Note 8-Impairments, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional information.\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities\naccounted for under the equity method are assessed\nfor impairment\nwhenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate\na loss in value has occurred.\nSuch evidence of a loss\nin value might include our inability to\nrecover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained\nearnings capacity\nwhich would justify the current investment amount,\nor a current fair value less than the investment's carrying\namount.\nWhen such a condition is judgmentally determined\nto be other than temporary, an impairment charge\nis recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated\nfair value.\nWhen\ndetermining whether a decline in value is other than\ntemporary, management considers factors such as the\nlength of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition\nand near-term prospects, and our\nability and intention to retain our investment for\na period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in the market value of the investment.\nSince quoted market prices are usually not\navailable, the fair\nvalue is typically based on the present value\nof expected future cash flows using discount\nrates and prices\nbelieved to be consistent with those used by principal\nmarket participants, plus market analysis\nof comparable\nassets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nDiffering assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of\nan impairment of an investment in any period.\nSee the APLNG\u201d section of Note 5-Investments,\nLoans and\nLong-Term Receivables,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs\nUnder various contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have material legal obligations to remove\ntangible\nequipment and restore the land or seabed at the\nend of operations at operational sites.\nOur largest asset\nremoval obligations involve plugging and abandonment\nof wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and\ngas\nplatforms around the world, as well as oil and gas\nproduction facilities and pipelines in Alaska.\nThe fair values\nof obligations for dismantling and removing these\nfacilities are recorded as a liability and\nan increase to PP&E\nat the time of installation of the asset based on estimated\ndiscounted costs.\nFair value is estimated using a\npresent value approach, incorporating assumptions\nabout estimated amounts and timing of settlements\nand\nimpacts of the use of technologies.\nEstimating future asset removal costs requires\nsignificant judgement.\nMost\nof these removal obligations are many years, or decades,\nin the future and the contracts and regulations\noften\nhave vague descriptions of what removal practices\nand criteria must be met when the removal\nevent actually\noccurs.\nThe carrying value of our asset retirement\nobligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset\nremoval technologies and costs, regulatory and other\ncompliance considerations, expenditure timing,\nand other\ninputs into valuation of the obligation, including\ndiscount and inflation rates, which are all\nsubject to change\nbetween the time of initial recognition of the liability\nand future settlement of our obligation.\nNormally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement\nas increases or decreases\nto DD&A over the remaining life of the assets.\nHowever, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as\nwell as previously sold assets for which we\nretained the asset removal obligation, an increase\nin the asset\nremoval obligation can result in an immediate\ncharge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E\ndue to the\nincreased obligation would immediately be subject\nto impairment, due to the low fair value of these\nproperties.\nIn addition to asset removal obligations, under the\nabove or similar contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have\ncertain environmental-related projects.\nThese are primarily related to remediation\nactivities required by\nCanada and various states\nwithin the U.S. at exploration and production sites.\nFuture environmental\nremediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are\nsubject to change due to such factors as the\nuncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown\ntime and extent of such remedial actions\nthat may be\nrequired, and the determination of our liability\nin proportion to that of other responsible parties.\nSee Note 9-\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental\nCosts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nProjected Benefit Obligations\nDetermination of the projected benefit obligations\nfor our defined benefit pension and postretirement\nplans are\nimportant to the recorded amounts for such obligations\non the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit\nexpense in the income statement.\nThe actuarial determination of projected benefit\nobligations and company\ncontribution requirements involves judgment about\nuncertain future events, including estimated\nretirement\ndates, salary levels at retirement, mortality\nrates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan\nassets, future\nhealth care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization\nof health care services by retirees.\nDue to the specialized\nnature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial\nfirms to assist in the determination of these\nprojected\nbenefit obligations and company contribution requirements.\nFor Employee Retirement Income Security Act-\ngoverned pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary\ncare on behalf of plan participants in the\ndetermination\nof the judgmental assumptions used in determining\nrequired company contributions into the\nplans.\nDue to\ndiffering objectives and requirements between financial\naccounting rules and the pension plan funding\nregulations promulgated by governmental agencies,\nthe actuarial methods and assumptions\nfor the two\npurposes differ in certain important respects.\nUltimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under\npension and postretirement benefit plans not\nfunded by plan assets or investment returns,\nbut the judgmental\nassumptions used in the actuarial calculations\nsignificantly affect periodic financial statements and funding\npatterns over time.\nProjected benefit obligations are particularly\nsensitive to the discount rate assumption.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase projected benefit obligations\nby\n$1,200 million.\nBenefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate\nand return on plan assets assumptions.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase annual benefit expense by\n$110 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return\non plan assets assumption would increase annual\nbenefit expense by $80 million.\nIn determining the discount rate, we use yields\non high-quality fixed income\ninvestments matched to the estimated benefit\ncash flows of our plans.\nWe are also exposed to the possibility\nthat lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension\nplans during the year could exceed the total of\nservice\nand interest components of annual pension expense\nand trigger accelerated recognition of a portion\nof\nunrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.\nThese benefit payments are based on decisions\nby plan\nparticipants and are therefore difficult to predict.\nIn the event there is a significant reduction in the\nexpected\nyears of future service of present employees or the\nelimination of the accrual of defined benefits\nfor some or all\nof their future services for a significant number\nof employees, we could recognize a curtailment\ngain or loss.\nSee Note 17-Employee Benefit Plans, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional\ninformation.\nContingencies\nA number of claims and lawsuits are made against\nthe company arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\nManagement exercises judgment related to accounting\nand disclosure of these claims which includes\nlosses,\ndamages, and underpayments associated with environmental\nremediation, tax, contracts, and other legal\ndisputes.\nAs we learn new facts concerning contingencies,\nwe reassess our position both with respect to\namounts recognized and disclosed considering changes\nto the probability of additional losses and potential\nexposure.\nHowever, actual losses can and do vary from estimates\nfor a variety of reasons including legal,\narbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement\ndiscussions; evaluation of scope of damages;\ninterpretation of regulatory or contractual terms;\nexpected timing of future actions; and proportion\nof liability\nshared with other responsible parties.\nEstimated future costs related to contingencies\nare subject to change as\nevents evolve and as additional information becomes\navailable during the administrative and litigation\nprocesses.\nFor additional information on contingent\nliabilities, see the Contingencies\u201d section\nwithin Capital\nResources and Liquidity\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies\nand Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.\nWe record deferred tax assets and\nliabilities to account for the expected future tax\nconsequences of events that have been recognized\nin our\nfinancial statements and our tax returns.\nWe routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by\na valuation allowance if we deem it is more\nlikely than not that some portion, or all,\nof the deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for adjustments\nto existing valuation allowances, we consider all\navailable positive and negative evidence. Positive\nevidence includes reversals of temporary\ndifferences,\nforecasts of future taxable income, assessment of\nfuture business assumptions and applicable\ntax planning\nstrategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative\nevidence includes losses in recent years\nas well as the\nforecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable\nperiod. In making our assessment regarding\nvaluation\nallowances, we weight the evidence based on\nobjectivity.\nNumerous judgments and assumptions are inherent\nin the determination of future taxable income, including\nfactors such as future operating conditions\nand the\nassessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal\nincome taxes (particularly as related to prevailing\noil and gas prices).\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that\ncould result from\nassessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions\nin countries where we operate.\nWe recognize a tax benefit\nfrom an uncertain tax position when it is more\nlikely than not that the position will be sustained\nupon\nexamination, based on the technical merits\nof the position.\nThese accruals for uncertain tax positions are\nsubject to a significant amount of judgment and\nare reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis\nin light of\nchanging facts and circumstances considering the\nprogress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings,\nchanges in\napplicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and\nlegislative guidance, or expiration of the\napplicable statute\nof limitations.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial\nStatements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nFOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR\u201d\nPROVISIONS OF\nTHE PRIVATE\nSECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis report

loss\u201d as used in Management's Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss)\nattributable to ConocoPhillips.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE\nOVERVIEW\nConocoPhillips is an independent E&P company\nwith operations and activities in 15 countries.\nOur diverse,\nlow cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich\nunconventional plays in North America;\nconventional\nassets in North America, Europe and Asia;\nLNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada;\nand an inventory of\nglobal conventional and unconventional exploration\nprospects.\nHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, at\nDecember 31, 2020, we employed approximately\n9,700 people worldwide and had total\nassets of $63 billion.\nCompleted Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition\nof Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent\noil\nand gas exploration and production company\nwith operations across New Mexico and West Texas.\nThe\naddition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland Basins creates a sizeable\nPermian presence to\naugment our leading unconventional positions\nin the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48\nand the Montney\nin Canada.\nConsideration for the all-stock transaction was\nvalued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares\nof ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock was exchanged for each outstanding\nshare of Concho common stock, resulting\nin the issuance\nof approximately 286 million shares of ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock.\nWe also assumed $3.9 billion in\naggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for\nConcho, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7\nbillion as\nof the closing date.\nThe combined companies are expected to\ncapture approximately $750 million of annual\ncost and capital savings by 2022.\nFor additional information\nrelated to this transaction, see Note 25-\nAcquisition of Concho Resources Inc. in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nThe energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with\nsimultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove\nthe industry into a severe downturn.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich\ncontinues to have unprecedented social and economic\nconsequences.\nMitigation efforts to stop the spread of\nthis highly-contagious disease include stay-at-home\norders and business closures that caused\nsharp\ncontractions in economic activity worldwide.\nThe supply shock was triggered by disagreements\nbetween\nOPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020,\nwhich resulted in significant supply coming\nonto the\nmarket\nand an oil price war.\nThese dual demand and supply shocks caused\noil prices to collapse as we exited\nthe first quarter of 2020.\nAs we entered the second quarter of 2020, predictions\nof COVID-19 driven global oil demand losses\nintensified, with forecasts\nof unprecedented demand declines.\nBased on these forecasts, OPEC plus nations\nheld an emergency meeting, and in April they announced\na coordinated production cut that was unprecedented\nin both its magnitude and duration.\nThe OPEC plus agreement spans from May 2020\nuntil April 2022, with\nthe volume of production cuts easing over time.\nAdditionally, non-OPEC plus countries, including the U.S.,\nCanada, Brazil and other G-20 countries,\nannounced organic reductions to production through the\nrelease of\ndrilling rigs, frac crews, normal field decline\nand curtailments.\nDespite these planned production decreases,\nthe supply cuts were not timely enough to overcome\nsignificant demand decline.\nFutures prices for April WTI\nclosed under $20 a barrel for the first time\nsince 2001, followed by May WTI settling below zero on the\nday\nbefore futures contracts expiry, as holders of May futures contracts struggled to exit\npositions and avoid taking\nphysical delivery.\nAs storage constraints approached, spot prices in\nApril for certain North American\nlandlocked grades of crude oil were in the single digits\nor even negative for particularly remote or low-grade\ncrudes, while waterborne priced crudes such as\nBrent sold at a relative advantage.\nThe extreme volatility\nexperienced\nin the first half of the year settled down in the\nsecond half of the year, with WTI crude oil prices\nexiting the year near $50 per barrel.\nSince the start of the severe downturn, we have closely\nmonitored the market and taken prudent actions in\nresponse to this situation.\nWe entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of\nmore than $5 billion, short-term investments\nof $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility\nof $6 billion, totaling\napproximately $14 billion in available liquidity.\nAdditionally, we had several entity and asset sales\nagreements in place, which generated $1.3 billion\nin proceeds from dispositions during 2020.\nFor more\ninformation about the sales of our Australia-West and non-core Lower 48 assets, see\nNote 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThis relative advantage\nallowed us to be measured in our response to\nthe sudden change in business environment.\nIn March, we announced an initial set of actions\nto address the downturn and followed up with additional\nactions in April.\nThe combined announcements reflected a reduction\nin our 2020 operating plan capital of $2.3\nbillion, a reduction to our operating costs of\n$600 million and suspension of our share\nrepurchase program.\nThese actions decreased uses of cash by approximately\n$5 billion in 2020.\nWe also established a framework\nfor evaluating our assets and implementing\neconomic production curtailments considering\nthe weakness in oil\nprices during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted\nin taking an additional significant step of voluntarily\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nIn the second quarter, we curtailed production by an estimated 225 MBOED,\nwith 145 MBOED of the\ncurtailments from the Lower 48, 40 MBOED from\nAlaska and 30 MBOED from our Surmont operation\nin\nCanada.\nThe remainder of the second-quarter curtailments\nwere primarily in Malaysia.\nOther industry\noperators also cut production and development\nplans and as we progressed through the second quarter, certain\nstay-at-home restrictions eased, which partially\nrestored lost demand, and WTI and Brent prices\nexited the\nsecond quarter around $40 per barrel.\nBased on our economic framework, we began\nrestoring production from\nvoluntary curtailments in July, and with oil stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we\nended our curtailment\nprogram during the third quarter.\nCurtailments in the third quarter averaged approximately\n90 MBOED, with\n65 MBOED attributable to the Lower 48 and 15 MBOED\nto Surmont.\nIn August 2020, we acquired\nadditional Montney acreage for cash consideration\nof $382 million, after\ncustomary post-closing adjustments.\nWe also assumed $31 million in financing obligations for associated\npartially owned infrastructure.\nThis acquisition consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties and included\n140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed\nasset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent\nto our\nexisting Montney position.\nThe transaction increased our Montney acreage\nposition to approximately 295,000\nnet acres with a 100 percent working interest.\nSee Note 4-Acquisitions and Dispositions in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\nIn October 2020, we announced an increase to our\nquarterly dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.43\nper share\nand resumed\nshare repurchases before suspending our\nshare repurchase program upon entry into\nour definitive\nagreement to acquire Concho.\nWe resumed shares repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our\nConcho acquisition.\nWe ended the year with over $12 billion of liquidity, comprised of $3.0 billion in cash\nand cash equivalents, $3.6 billion in short-term\ninvestments, and available borrowings under our credit\nfacility\nof $5.7 billion.\nOur expectation is that commodity prices will\nremain cyclical and volatile, and a successful\nbusiness strategy\nin the E&P industry must be resilient in\nlower price environments, at the same time retaining\nupside during\nperiods of higher prices.\nWhile we are not impervious to current market\nconditions, we believe our decisive\nactions over the last several years of focusing on free\ncash flow generation, high-grading our asset\nbase,\nlowering the cost of supply of our investment\nresource portfolio, and strengthening our\nbalance sheet have put\nus in a strong relative position compared to our\nindependent E&P peers.\nWe remain committed to the core\nprinciples of our value proposition, namely, free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet, commitment to\ndifferential returns of and on capital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOur workforce and operations have adjusted to\nmitigate the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nWe have\noperations in remote areas with confined spaces,\nsuch as offshore platforms, the North Slope of Alaska,\nCurtis\nIsland in Australia, western Canada and Indonesia,\nwhere viruses could rapidly spread.\nPersonnel are asked to\nperform a self-assessment for symptoms of illness\neach day and, when appropriate, are subject to\nmore\nrestrictive measures before traveling to and working\non location.\nStaffing levels in certain operating locations\nhave been reduced to minimize health risk exposure\nand increase social distancing.\nA portion of our office\nstaff have continued to work successfully remotely, with offices around the world carefully\ndesigning and\nexecuting a flexible, phased reentry, following national, state and local guidelines.\nThese mitigation measures\nhave thus far been effective at reducing business operation\ndisruptions.\nWorkforce health and safety remains\nthe overriding driver for our actions and we have\ndemonstrated our ability to adapt to local\nconditions as\nwarranted.\nThe marketing and supply chain\nside of our business has also adapted in response\nto COVID-19.\nOur\ncommercial organization managed transportation commitments\nduring our voluntary curtailment program.\nOur supply chain function is proactively working\nwith vendors to ensure the continuity of our business\noperations, monitor distressed service and materials\nproviders, capture deflation opportunities, and pursue\ncost\nreduction efforts.\nWe also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period\nand\nrequested credit assurances when applicable.\nOperationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business.\nIn 2020, production of 1,127 MBOED\ngenerated cash provided by operating activities\nof $4.8 billion.\nWe invested $4.7\nbillion into the business in\nthe form of capital expenditures, including $0.5\nbillion of acquisition capital, and paid dividends\nto\nshareholders of $1.8 billion.\nProduction decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent\nin 2020, compared to 2019.\nProduction excluding\nLibya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions\nand dispositions;\nand excluding Libya, production for 2020\nwould have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15\nMBOED compared with 2019 production.\nThis decrease\nwas primarily due to normal field decline, partly\noffset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway,\nAlaska and China.\nProduction from Libya averaged 9 MBOED\nas it was in force majeure during a significant\nportion of the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Summary\nSignificant items during 2020 and recent announcements\nincluded the following:\n\u25cf\nEnhanced both our portfolio and financial framework through the\nacquisition of Concho in an all-stock\ntransaction, as well as purchasing bolt-on acreage in Canada and Lower\n48.\n\u25cf\nFull-year production, excluding Libya, of 1,118\nMBOED; curtailed approximately 80 MBOED during the\nyear.\n\u25cf\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion.\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.3 billion in disposition proceeds from non-core asset sales.\n\u25cf\nDistributed $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $0.9 billion of shares.\n\u25cf\nEnded the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.0 billion and\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion,\nequaling $6.6 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\u25cf\nAnnounced two significant discoveries in Norway and achieved first production\nat Tor II; continued\nappraisal drilling and started up first pads and related infrastructure\nin Montney.\n\u25cf\nAdopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with ambition to achieve net\n-zero operated emissions by\n2050 as part of our commitment to ESG excellence.\n\u25cf\nRecognized impairments of proved and unproved properties totaling $1.3\nbillion after-tax.\nBusiness Environment\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $42 per barrel in 2020,\ncompared with $64 per barrel in 2019.\nThe energy\nindustry has periodically experienced this type\nof volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand\nconditions\nand such volatility may persist for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nCommodity prices are the most significant\nfactor\nimpacting our profitability and related reinvestment\nof operating cash flows into our business.\nOur strategy is\nto create value through price cycles by delivering\non the foundational principles that underpin our\nvalue\nproposition; free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet,\ncommitment to differential returns of and on\ncapital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOperational and Financial Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nThe focus areas we believe will drive our success\nthrough the price cycles include:\n\u25cf\nFree cash flow generation.\nThis is a core principle of our value proposition.\nOur goal is to achieve\nstrong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline,\ncontrolling our costs, and safely and reliably\ndelivering production.\nThroughout the price cycles, we expect to make capital\ninvestments sufficient\nto sustain production.\nFree cash flow provides funds that are available\nto return to shareholders,\nstrengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles, or reinvest back into\nthe business for future cash flow expansion.\no\nMaintain capital allocation discipline.\nWe participate in a commodity price-driven and\ncapital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment\ndecision is made\nto the time an asset is operational and generates cash\nflow.\nAs a result, we must invest\nsignificant capital dollars to explore for new oil\nand gas fields, develop newly discovered\nfields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines\nand LNG facilities.\nWe allocate\ncapital across a geographically diverse, low cost\nof supply resource base, which combined\nwith legacy assets results in low production decline.\nCost of supply is the WTI equivalent\nprice that generates a 10 percent after-tax return\non a point-forward and fully burdened basis.\nFully burdened includes capital infrastructure,\nforeign exchange, price related inflation and\nG&A.\nIn setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous\napproach that evaluates projects\nusing this cost of supply criteria, which we believe\nwill lead to value maximization and cash\nflow expansion using an optimized investment\npace, not production growth for growth's sake.\nOur cash allocation priorities call for the investment\nof sufficient capital to sustain production\nand pay the existing dividend.\nAdditional capital may be allocated toward\ngrowth, but\ndiscipline will be maintained.\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of\n$5.5 billion.\nThe plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for\ninvestment in major projects, primarily in\nAlaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the\ncombined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED\nin 2021.\nThis production guidance\nexcludes Libya.\no\nControl costs and expenses.\nControlling operating and overhead costs,\nwithout compromising\nsafety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority.\nWe monitor these costs using\nvarious methodologies that are reported to senior management\nmonthly, on both an absolute-\ndollar basis and a per-unit basis.\nManaging operating and overhead costs is\ncritical to\nmaintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity\nprice\nenvironment.\nThe ability to control our operating and overhead\ncosts impacts our ability to\ndeliver strong cash from operations.\nIn 2020, our production and operating expenses\nwere 18\npercent lower than 2019, primarily due to decreased\nwellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from production curtailments across\nour North American operated assets as well as\nthe absence of costs related to our U.K. and\nAustralia-West divestitures.\nFor more\ninformation related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures, see note 4-Acquisitions\nand\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAt the time of the Concho acquisition announcement\nin October 2020, we announced planned\ncost reductions and quantified $350 million\nof annual expense savings expected to be\nachieved by 2022.\nThese reductions included approximately $150 million\ndue to streamlining\nour internal organization to appropriate levels given the\ncurrent industry environment and\nrecent asset sales; $100 million of G&A and\nG&G due to a refocused exploration program;\nand $100 million of redundant G&A costs on\na combined basis related to the Concho\nacquisition.\nSubsequent to the transaction announcement,\nwe identified $250 million of\nfurther cost reductions from the combined companies\nto be achieved by 2022.\no\nOptimize our portfolio.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho and\nsignificantly increased our unconventional portfolio\nwith years of low cost of supply\ninvestments.\nThe addition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland basins\ncreates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading\nunconventional positions in the\nEagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.\nWe added to our unconventional Montney position\nwith an asset acquisition that consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties directly adjacent\nto our existing acreage.\nThese acquisitions followed several non-core asset\nsales earlier in the year including\nAustralia-West in our Asia Pacific segment,\nand Niobrara and Waddell Ranch in the Lower\n48.\nWe managed the portfolio well during a turbulent year, with asset sales entered at the end\nof 2019 generating $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions\nin the first half of 2020,\nfollowed by opportunistic acquisitions of unconventional\nassets in the second half of 2020\nafter commodity prices had dropped.\nWe will continue to evaluate our assets to determine\nwhether they compete for capital within our portfolio\nand will optimize the portfolio as\nnecessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments.\n\u25cf\nA strong balance sheet.\nWe believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as\nours.\nOur strong operating performance buffered by a solid\nbalance sheet enables us to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles.\nOur priorities include execution of our\ndevelopment plans,\nmaintaining a growing dividend, and returning competitive\nreturns of capital to shareholders.\n\u25cf\nCommitment to differential returns of and on capital.\nWe believe in delivering value to our\nshareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by additional returns of\ncapital,\nincluding share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid dividends on our common stock\nof approximately $1.8\nbillion and repurchased $0.9\nbillion of our common stock.\nCombined, our dividend and repurchases\nrepresented\n57 percent of our net cash provided by operating\nactivities.\nSince we initiated our current\nshare repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased\n189 million shares for $10.5 billion,\nwhich represents approximately 15 percent of shares\noutstanding as of September 30, 2016.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase\nauthority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase\nprogram our Board of Directors had authorized.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion,\nat prevailing prices, subject to market conditions\nand other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors Our\nability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase\nshares is subject to certain considerations.\u201d\nIn October 2020, we announced that our Board\nof Directors approved an increase to our quarterly\ndividend of $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share.\nIn February 2021, we resumed share repurchases\nafter\nthe completion of our Concho acquisition.\n\u25cf\nESG Leadership.\nSafety and environmental stewardship,\nincluding the operating integrity of our\nassets, remain our highest priorities, and we\nare committed to protecting the health and\nsafety of\neveryone who has a role in our operations and\nthe communities in which we operate.\nWe strive to\nconduct our business with respect and care for\nboth the local and global environment and\nsystematically manage risk to drive sustainable business\ngrowth.\nDemonstrating our commitment to\nsustainability and environmental stewardship, in\nOctober 2020, we announced our adoption of a Paris-\naligned climate risk framework as part of our continued\nleadership in ESG excellence.\nThis\ncomprehensive climate risk strategy should enable\nus to sustainably meet global energy demand while\ndelivering competitive returns through the energy transition.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross\noperated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity\nby 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030,\nwith an\nambition to achieve net zero by 2050 for operated\nemissions.\nWe are advocating for reduction of\nscope 3 end-use emissions intensity through our\nsupport for a U.S. carbon price and reaffirmed\nour\ncommitment to the Climate Leadership Council.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to\nwork towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030\nand are the first U.S.-based oil and gas company\nto\nadopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy.\n\u25cf\nAdd to our proved reserve base.\nWe primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\no\nPurchases of increased interests in existing\nfields and acquisitions.\no\nApplication of new technologies and processes\nto improve recovery from existing fields.\no\nSuccessful exploration, exploitation and development\nof new and existing fields.\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines,\nthe estimated future date when an asset will reach\nthe\nend of its economic life is based on historical 12-month\nfirst-of-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will\nend and affects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the estimate of proved reserves also\nchanges.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices\nrise.\nReserve replacement represents the net change in\nproved reserves, net of production, divided\nby our\ncurrent year production, as shown in our supplemental\nreserve table disclosures.\nOur reserve\nreplacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting\nthe impact of lower prices, which reduced\nreserves by approximately 600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas negative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, primarily\nimpacted by lower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended\nDecember 31, 2020, which excluded\na net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales\nand purchases, was\n53 percent.\nAccess to additional resources may become increasingly\ndifficult as commodity prices can make\nprojects uneconomic or unattractive.\nIn addition, prohibition of direct investment\nin some nations,\nnational fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies,\nand lack of access\nto high-potential areas due to environmental or other\nregulation may negatively impact our\nability to\nincrease our reserve base.\nAs such, the timing and level at which we add\nto our reserve base may, or\nmay not, allow us to replace our production\nover subsequent years.\n\u25cf\nApply technical capability.\nWe leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely\ndeliver on our plans.\nTechnical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically\nconvert\nadditional resources to reserves, achieve greater\noperating efficiencies and reduce our environmental\nimpact.\nCompanywide, we continue to leverage knowledge\nof technological successes across our\noperations.\nWe have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to\nwork and operate\nmore efficiently.\nPredictive analytics have been adopted in our operations\nand planning process.\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning and\ndeep learning are being used for emissions\nmonitoring,\nseismic advancements and advanced controls in\nour field operations.\n\u25cf\nAttract, develop and retain a talented work force.\nWe strive to attract, develop and retain individuals\nwith the knowledge and skills to successfully\nexecute our business strategy in a manner\nexemplifying\nour core values and ethics.\nWe offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the\nbest early career talent.\nWe also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad\nrange of expertise and experience.\nWe promote continued learning, development and technical\ntraining through structured development programs\ndesigned to enhance the technical and functional\nskills of our employees.\nOther Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nOther significant factors that can affect our profitability\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEnergy commodity prices.\nOur earnings and operating cash flows generally\ncorrelate with industry\nprice levels for crude oil and natural gas.\nIndustry price levels are subject to factors external\nto the\ncompany and over which we have no control, including\nbut not limited to global economic health,\nsupply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil\nunrest or military conflicts, actions taken by\nOPEC\nand other producing countries, environmental laws,\ntax regulations, governmental policies and\nweather-related disruptions.\nThe following graph depicts the average benchmark\nprices for WTI\ncrude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural\ngas:\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $41.68 per barrel\nin 2020, a decrease of 35 percent compared\nwith\n$64.30 per barrel in 2019.\nSimilarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 31 percent from $57.02 per\nbarrel in 2019 to $39.37 per barrel in 2020.\nCrude oil prices were lower due to the dual\ndemand and\nsupply shocks.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which continues to\nhave unprecedented social and economic consequences.\nThe supply shock was triggered by\ndisagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning\nin early March 2020, which resulted in\nsignificant supply coming onto the market\nand created higher inventory levels.\nHenry Hub natural gas prices\ndecreased 21 percent from an average of $2.63\nper MMBTU in 2019 to\n$2.08 per MMBTU in 2020.\nHenry Hub prices were depressed due to high\nstorage levels and weak\ndemand.\nOur realized bitumen price decreased 75 percent\nfrom an average of $31.72 per barrel\nin 2019 to $8.02\nper barrel in 2020.\nThe decrease was largely driven by weakness in WTI,\nreflective of impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly\nflat as\ncurtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government,\nwhich limited production from the province,\ncontinued throughout 2020.\nWe continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through\nimprovements in alternate blend capability which\nresults in lower diluent costs and access\nto the U.S.\nGulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts.\nOur worldwide annual average realized price decreased\n34 percent from $48.78\nper BOE in 2019 to\n$32.15\nper BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized\noil, natural gas and bitumen prices.\nNorth America's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource\nscarcity to one\nof abundance.\nIn recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing\nand horizontal drilling in\nunconventional formations has led to increased industry\nactual and forecasted crude oil and natural\ngas production in the U.S.\nAlthough providing significant short-\nand long-term growth opportunities\nfor our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development\nof\nunconventional plays could also have adverse financial\nimplications to us, including: an extended\nperiod of low commodity prices; production curtailments;\nand delay of plans to develop areas such as\nunconventional fields.\nShould one or more of these events occur, our revenues would\nbe reduced, and\nadditional asset impairments might be possible.\n\u25cf\nImpairments.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry.\nAt times, our PP&E and investments\nbecome impaired when, for example, commodity\nprices decline significantly for long\nperiods of time,\nour reserve estimates are revised downward, or a\ndecision to dispose of an asset leads to\na write-down\nto its fair value.\nWe may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory\ndrilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material\nimpairment of leasehold values.\nAs we optimize\nour assets in the future, it is reasonably possible\nwe may incur future losses upon sale or\nimpairment\ncharges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments\nin nonconsolidated entities accounted for\nunder the equity method, and unproved properties.\nFor additional information on our impairments,\nsee Note 7-Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8-Impairments, in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nEffective tax rate.\nOur operations are in countries with different tax rates\nand fiscal structures.\nAccordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment,\nour overall\neffective tax rate can vary significantly between periods\nbased on the mix\u201d of before-tax earnings\nwithin our global operations.\n\u25cf\nFiscal and regulatory environment.\nOur operations can be affected by changing economic,\nregulatory\nand political environments in the various countries\nin which we operate, including the U.S.\nCivil\nunrest or strained relationships with governments\nmay impact our operations or investments.\nThese\nchanging environments could negatively impact our\nresults of operations, and further changes to\nincrease government fiscal take could have a\nnegative impact on future operations.\nOur management\ncarefully considers the fiscal and regulatory\nenvironment when evaluating projects or\ndetermining the\nlevels and locations of our activity.\nOutlook\nProduction and Capital\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of $5.5\nbillion.\nThe\nplan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for investment\nin major projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing\nexploration appraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nRestructuring\nAs a result of the acquisition of Concho, we commenced\na restructuring program in the first quarter\nof 2021 in\nassociation with combining the operations of the\ntwo companies.\nWe expect to incur significant non-recurring\ntransaction and acquisition-related costs in\n2021 for employee severance payments; incremental\npension\nbenefit costs related to the workforce reductions; employee\nretention costs; employee relocations; fees\npaid to\nfinancial, legal, and accounting advisors; and\nfiling fees.\nWe currently cannot estimate these costs, as well as\nother unanticipated items,\nand expect to recognize the majority\nof these expenses in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily\ndefined by geographic region:\nAlaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East\nand North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs\nnot directly associated with an operating\nsegment, such as\nmost interest expense, premiums incurred on the\nearly retirement of debt, corporate overhead,\ncertain\ntechnology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical\ntables provided at the beginning of the operating\nsegment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity\nprices and production.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEffective with the third quarter of 2020, we have restructured our segments to align with\nchanges to our\ninternal organization.\nThe Middle East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific and Middle East\nsegment\nto the Europe and North Africa segment.\nThe segments have been renamed the Asia Pacific\nsegment and the\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nWe have revised segment information disclosures and\nsegment performance metrics presented within our results of operations for the\ncurrent and prior years.\nThis section of the Form 10-K\ndiscusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020\nand 2019.\nFor discussion of\nyear-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, see\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\" in Exhibit\n99.1\n-\n, Item 7 filed with

ConocoPhillips\ndecreased $9.9 billion in 2020.\nThe decrease was mainly due\nto:\n\u25cf\nLower realized commodity prices.\n\u25cf\nLower sales volumes due to normal field decline,\nasset dispositions and production curtailments.\nFor\nadditional information related to dispositions,\nsee Note 4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated\nwith the completion of the sale of two\nConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nFor additional information, see Note 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\u25cf\nAn unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax\non our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2020,\nas compared to a $649 million after-tax unrealized\ngain on those shares in 2019.\n\u25cf\nA $648 million after-tax impairment for the associated\ncarrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs and an equity method investment\nrelated to our Alaska North Slope Gas\nasset.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nIncreased impairments\nprimarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets which were\nwritten down to fair value due to lower commodity\nprices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of other income of $317 million after-tax\nrelated to our settlement agreement with\nPDVSA.\nThese decreases in net income (loss) were partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nLower production and operating expenses, primarily\ndue to the absence of costs related to our U.K.\nand Australia-West divestitures and decreased wellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from\nproduction curtailments across our North American\noperated assets.\n\u25cf\nA $597 million after-tax gain on dispositions related\nto our Australia-West divestiture.\n\u25cf\nLower DD&A expenses, primarily due to lower\nvolumes related to normal field decline and\nproduction curtailments as well as impacts\nof our Australia-West and U.K. divestitures.\nPartly\noffsetting this decrease, was higher DD&A expenses\ndue to price-related downward reserve revisions.\nIncome Statement Analysis\n2020 vs. 2019\nSales and other operating revenues decreased 42 percent\nin 2020, mainly due to lower realized commodity\nprices and lower sales volumes.\nSales volumes decreased due to normal field\ndecline, production curtailments\nfrom our North American operated assets and the\ndivestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and\nour Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates decreased $347 million\nin 2020, primarily due to lower earnings from\nQG3 and\nAPLNG because of lower LNG prices.\nPartly offsetting this decrease was the absence\nof impairments related\nto equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment\nof $155 million and the absence of a $118 million\ndeferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nGain on dispositions decreased $1.4 billion in\n2020, primarily due to the absence of a $1.7 billion\nbefore-tax\ngain associated with the completion of the sale\nof two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nPartly offsetting the\ndecrease was a $587 million before-tax gain associated\nwith our Australia-West divestiture.\nFor more\ninformation related to these dispositions, see Note\n4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (loss) decreased $1.9 billion\nin 2020, primarily due to a before-tax unrealized\nloss of $855\nmillion on our CVE common shares in 2020, and\nthe absence of a $649 million before-tax unrealized\ngain on\nthose shares in 2019.\nAdditionally, other income (loss) decreased due to the absence of $325 million\nbefore-\ntax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA.\nFor discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 6-Investment\nin Cenovus Energy in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nFor discussion of our PDVSA settlement,\nsee Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nPurchased commodities decreased 32 percent in\n2020, primarily due to lower natural gas\nand crude oil prices;\nlower crude oil and natural gas volumes purchased;\nand the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the\nthird quarter of\n2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nProduction and operating expenses decreased $978\nmillion in 2020, primarily due to reduced activities\nand\ntransportation costs associated with lower activity\nacross our North American operated assets in\nresponse to\nthe low commodity price environment and the\nabsence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West\ndivestitures.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased\n$126 million in 2020, primarily due to lower\ncosts\nassociated with compensation and benefits,\nincluding mark to market impacts of certain\nkey employee\ncompensation programs.\nExploration expenses increased $714 million\nin 2020, primarily due to an $828 million before-tax\nimpairment\nfor the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs related to our Alaska\nNorth Slope Gas\nasset.\nPartly offsetting this increase, was the absence of\na $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment\nexpense due to our decision to discontinue exploration\nactivities in the Central Louisiana Austin\nChalk trend.\nFor additional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairments increased $408 million in\n2020, primarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets\nwhich were written down to fair value due to lower\ncommodity prices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $199 million in 2020, primarily due\nto lower commodity prices and\nvolumes.\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased\n$138 million in 2020, due to gains recognized\nfrom\nforeign currency derivatives and other foreign\ncurrency remeasurements.\nFor additional information, see Note\n13-Derivative and Financial Instruments\nin the

Norway, Canada, Australia,\nIndonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya.\n2020 vs. 2019\nTotal production, including Libya, of 1,127 MBOED decreased 221 MBOED or 16\npercent in 2020 compared\nwith 2019,\nprimarily due to:\n\u25cf\nNormal field decline.\n\u25cf\nThe divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the\nsecond quarter of 2020.\n\u25cf\nProduction curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED,\nprimarily from North American operated\nassets and Malaysia, in response to the low crude\noil price environment.\n\u25cf\nLess production in Libya due to the forced shutdown\nof the Es Sider export terminal and other\neastern\nexport terminals after a period of civil unrest.\nThe decrease in production during 2020 was partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nNew wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway, Alaska and China.\nProduction excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED and closed acquisitions\nand dispositions, production for 2020 would\nhave been\n1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared\nwith 2019.\nThis decrease was

sources, including\ncash generated from operating activities,\nproceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper\nand credit facility\nprograms and our ability to sell securities\nusing our shelf registration statement.\nIn 2020, the primary uses of\nour available cash were $4,715 million to support\nour ongoing capital expenditures and investments\nprogram;\n$1,831 million to pay dividends on our common\nstock; $892 million to repurchase our common\nstock; and\n$658 million for net purchase of investments.\nDuring 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased\nby $2,097\nmillion to $2,991 million.\nWe entered the year with a strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents\nof over $5 billion, short-\nterm investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn\ncredit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately\n$14 billion\nin available liquidity.\nThis strong foundation allowed us to be measured\nin our response to the sudden change\nin business environment as we exited the first\nquarter of 2020.\nIn response to the oil market downturn\nthat\nbegan in early 2020,\nwe announced the following capital, share repurchase\nand operating cost reductions. We\nreduced our 2020 operating plan capital expenditures\nby a total of $2.3 billion, or approximately\nthirty-five\npercent of the original guidance.\nWe suspended our share repurchase program, further reducing cash outlays\nby approximately $2 billion.\nWe also reduced our operating costs by approximately $0.6 billion,\nor roughly\nten percent of the original 2020 guidance.\nCollectively, these actions represent a reduction in 2020 cash uses of\napproximately $5 billion versus the original operating\nplan.\nConsidering the weakness in oil prices during the\nsecond quarter of 2020, we established a framework\nfor\nevaluating and implementing economic curtailments,\nwhich resulted in taking an additional significant\nstep of\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nBased on our economic criteria, we began\nrestoring production\nfrom voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil prices stabilizing around $40 per\nbarrel, we ended our\ncurtailment program by the end of the third quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed\nshare repurchases, repurchasing $0.2 billion\nof shares in October,\nbefore suspending our share repurchase program\nupon entry into a definitive agreement to\nacquire Concho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho\nacquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2020,\nwe had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion,\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion, and available borrowing capacity under\nour credit facility of $5.7 billion, totaling\nover $12 billion of\nliquidity.\nWe believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external\nsources of funds as described below in the Significant\nChanges in Capital\u201d section, will be sufficient\nto meet\nour funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including\nour capital spending program, dividend\npayments and required debt payments.\nSignificant Changes in Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2020, cash provided by operating activities\nwas $4,802 million, a 57 percent decrease from 2019.\nThe\ndecrease was primarily due to lower realized\ncommodity prices, normal field decline,\nproduction curtailments,\nthe divestiture of our U.K.\nand Australia-West assets, and the absence in 2020 of collections under our\nsettlement agreement with PDVSA,\npartially offset by lower production and operating\nexpenses.\nOur short-\nand long-term operating cash flows are highly\ndependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, LNG and NGLs.\nPrices and margins in our industry have historically\nbeen volatile and are driven by\nmarket conditions over which we have no control.\nAbsent other mitigating factors, as these\nprices and margins\nfluctuate, we would expect a corresponding\nchange in our operating cash flows.\nThe level of absolute production volumes, as\nwell as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.\nFull-\nyear production averaged 1,127 MBOED in 2020.\nFull-year production excluding Libya averaged\n1,118\nMBOED in 2020.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately\n80 MBOED;\nclosed acquisitions and\ndispositions;\nand excluding Libya; production for 2020 was 1,176 MBOED.\nProduction in 2021 is expected to\nbe approximately 1.5 MMBOED, reflecting the\nimpact from the Concho acquisition.\nFuture production is\nsubject to numerous uncertainties, including,\namong others, the volatile crude oil and\nnatural gas price\nenvironment, which may impact investment decisions;\nthe effects of price changes on production sharing\nand\nvariable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition\nof fields; field production decline rates; new\ntechnologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups\nand major turnarounds; political instability;\nweather-\nrelated disruptions; and the addition of proved\nreserves through exploratory success and\ntheir timely and cost-\neffective development.\nWhile we actively manage these factors,\nproduction levels can cause variability in cash\nflows, although generally this variability\nhas not been as significant as that caused by commodity\nprices.\nTo maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue\nto add to our proved\nreserve base.\nOur proved reserves generally increase as prices\nrise and decrease as prices decline.\nReserve\nreplacement represents the net change in proved\nreserves, net of production, divided by our current\nyear\nproduction, as shown in our supplemental reserve table\ndisclosures.\nOur reserve replacement was negative 86\npercent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower\nprices, which reduced reserves by approximately\n600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas\nnegative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, reflecting the impact\nof\nlower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended December 31, 2020,\nwhich excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related\nto sales and purchases, was 53 percent.\nFor additional information about our 2021 capital\nbudget, see the 2021 Capital Budget\u201d section\nwithin\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\u201d and for additional\ninformation on proved reserves, including both\ndeveloped and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil\nand Gas Operations\u201d section of this report.\nAs discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d\nsection, engineering estimates of proved\nreserves are\nimprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised\nupward or downward due to the impact of changes\nin\ncommodity prices or as more technical data becomes\navailable on reservoirs.\nIt is not possible to reliably\npredict how revisions will impact reserve quantities\nin the future.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2020, we invested $4.7 billion in capital\nexpenditures, of which $0.5 billion consisted of\nstrategic\nacquisitions, including additional Montney acreage.\nCapital expenditures invested in 2019 and 2018\nwere $6.6\nbillion and $6.8 billion,\nrespectively.\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the\nCapital Expenditures and

and provide resiliency\nto react to short-term price volatility are invested\nin\nhighly liquid instruments with maturities within\nthe year.\nFunds we consider available to maintain resiliency\nin longer term price downturns and to capture\nopportunities outside a given operating\nplan may be invested in\ninstruments with maturities greater than one year.\nFor additional information, see Note

agreement also contains early termination\nrights if our current directors or their approved\nsuccessors cease to be a majority of the Board\nof Directors.\nThe revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips\nCompany's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of\ncommercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term\nworking capital needs.\nCommercial\npaper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.\nWith $300 million of commercial paper outstanding and no\ndirect borrowings or letters of credit,\nwe had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity\nunder the revolving\ncredit facility at December 31, 2020.\nWe may consider issuing additional commercial paper in the future to\nsupplement our cash position.\nIn October 2020, Moody's affirmed its rating of

\u2018Moderately High' from\n\u2018Intermediate' based on a view of increasing\nrisks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker\nprofitability.\nOn February 11, 2021, S&P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt\nfrom A\u201d to A-\u201d with a\nstable\u201d outlook and downgraded its rating of our short-term\ndebt from A-1\u201d to A-2.\u201d\nWe do not have any\nratings triggers on any of our corporate debt\nthat would cause an automatic default, and\nthereby impact our\naccess to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.\nIf our credit ratings\nare downgraded from their\ncurrent levels, it could increase the cost of corporate\ndebt available to us and restrict our access to\nthe\ncommercial paper markets.\nIf our credit rating were to deteriorate\nto a level prohibiting us from accessing the\ncommercial paper market, we would still\nbe able to access funds under our revolving credit\nfacility.\nCertain of our project-related contracts, commercial\ncontracts and derivative instruments contain\nprovisions\nrequiring us to post collateral.\nMany of these contracts and instruments permit\nus to post either cash or letters\nof credit as collateral.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had direct\nbank letters of credit of $249 million\nand $277 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to\nvarious purchase\ncommitments incident to the ordinary conduct of\nbusiness.\nIn the event of credit\nratings downgrades, we may\nbe required to post additional letters of\ncredit.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition,\nwe assumed Concho's publicly traded debt.\nOn December 7, 2020, we launched an offer to exchange\nConcho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips.\nThe exchange offer settled on February 8,\n2021.\nOf the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate\nprincipal amount of Concho's notes subject to the\nexchange offer, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered and\nexchanged for new debt issued by\nConocoPhillips.\nThere were no impacts to ConocoPhillips'\ncredit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.\nFor\nadditional information,\nsee Note 10-Debt and Note 25-Acquisition\nof Concho Resources Inc., in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShelf Registration\nWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which\nwe have the ability to issue\nand sell an indeterminate amount of various types\nof debt and equity securities.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nWe have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company\nand Burlington Resources\nLLC, with respect to publicly held debt securities.\nConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent\nowned by\nConocoPhillips.\nBurlington Resources LLC is 100 percent\nowned by ConocoPhillips Company.\nConocoPhillips and/or ConocoPhillips Company\nhave fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nthe payment\nobligations of Burlington Resources LLC, with respect\nto its publicly held debt securities.\nSimilarly,\nConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips\nCompany\nwith respect to its publicly held debt securities.\nIn addition, ConocoPhillips Company\nhas fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations\nof ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly\nheld debt\nsecurities.\nAll guarantees are joint and several.\nIn March of 2020, the SEC adopted amendments\nto simplify the financial disclosure requirements\nfor\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nregistered under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X.\nBased on our\nevaluation of our existing guarantee relationships,\nwe qualify for the transition to alternative disclosures.\nWe\nelected early voluntary compliance with the final\namendments beginning in the third quarter\nof 2020.\nAccordingly, condensed consolidating information by guarantor and issuer of\nguaranteed securities will no\nlonger be reported, and alternative disclosures\nof summarized financial information for the\nconsolidated\nObligor Group is presented.\nThe following tables present summarized financial\ninformation for the Obligor\nGroup, as defined below:\n\u25cf\nThe Obligor Group will reflect guarantors and issuers\nof guaranteed securities consisting of\nConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and\nBurlington Resources LLC.\n\u25cf\nConsolidating adjustments for elimination\nof investments in and transactions between the collective\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nare reflected in the balances of the summarized\nfinancial information.\n\u25cf\nNon-Obligated Subsidiaries are excluded\nfrom this presentation.\nTransactions and balances reflecting activity between the Obligors\nand Non-Obligated Subsidiaries are\npresented separately below:\nSummarized Income Statement Data\nMillions of Dollars\nRevenues and Other Income\n$\n8,375\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(2,999)\nNet income (loss)\n(2,701)\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips\n(2,701)\nSummarized Balance Sheet Data\nMillions of Dollars\nDecember 31, 2020\nCurrent assets\n$\n8,535\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\nNoncurrent assets\n37,180\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n7,730\nCurrent liabilities\n3,797\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\n1,365\nNoncurrent liabilities\n18,627\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n3,972\nCapital Requirements\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the Capital Expenditures\nand\nInvestments\u201d\nsection.\nOur debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15,369\nmillion, an increase of $474 million from\nthe balance at\nDecember 31, 2019.\nMaturities of debt (including payments for\nfinance leases) due in 2021 of $601 million,\nexcluding net unamortized premiums and discounts,\nwill be paid from current cash balances and cash\ngenerated by operations.\nFor more information on Debt, see Note 10-Debt,\nin the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing and sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by\nadditional returns of capital, including share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid $1,831 million, $1.69 per share of\ncommon stock, in dividends. This is an increase\nover 2019 and 2018, when we paid $1.34 and\n$1.16 per share\nof common stock, respectively.\nIn February 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend\nof $0.43 per share,\npayable March 1, 2021, to stockholders of record\nat the close of business on February 12, 2021.\nIn late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase\nprogram, which has a current total program\nauthorization of $25 billion of our common stock.\nCost of share repurchases were $892 million,\n$3,500\nmillion and $2,999 million in 2020, 2019 and\n2018,\nrespectively.\nShare repurchases since inception of our\ncurrent program totaled 189\nmillion shares at a cost of $10,517 million, as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nIn the\nfourth quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchases\nupon entry into a definitive agreement\nto acquire\nConcho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after the completion of our Concho acquisition.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices,\nsubject to market conditions and other\nfactors.\nOur dividend and share repurchase programs are\nsubject to numerous considerations, including\nmarket\nconditions, management discretion and other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors\n-\nOur ability to declare and\npay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to\ncertain considerations.\u201d\nIn addition to the requirements above, we have contractual\nobligations for the purchase of goods and services\nof approximately $8,123 million.\nWe expect to fulfill $2,805 million of these obligations in 2021.

projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nFor information on PUDs and the associated costs\nto develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas\nOperations\u201d\nsection in this report.\nContingencies\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims\narising in the ordinary course of business\nhave been filed\nagainst ConocoPhillips.\nWe also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the\nplacement, storage, disposal or release of certain\nchemical, mineral and petroleum substances\nat various active\nand inactive sites.\nWe regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these\ncontingencies.\nIn the case of all known contingencies (other\nthan those related to income taxes), we accrue\na\nliability when the loss is probable and the amount\nis reasonably estimable.\nIf a range of amounts can be\nreasonably estimated and no amount within the range\nis a better estimate than any other amount,\nthen the low\nend of the range is accrued.\nWe do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.\nWe accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable.\nWith respect to income\ntax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted\nloss accrual in cases where sustaining a\ntax position is less than certain.\nBased on currently available information, we believe\nit is remote that future costs related to known\ncontingent\nliability exposures will exceed current accruals by\nan amount that would have a material\nadverse impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nFor information on other contingencies, see\nCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters\ninvolving oil and gas royalty\nand severance tax payments, gas measurement and\nvaluation methods, contract disputes,\nenvironmental\ndamages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.\nOur primary exposures for such matters\nrelate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments\non certain federal, state and privately owned\nproperties and\nclaims of alleged environmental contamination\nfrom historic operations.\nWe will continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience\nand professional judgment to the specific\ncharacteristics of our cases, employing a litigation\nmanagement process to manage and monitor the\nlegal\nproceedings against us.\nOur process facilitates the early evaluation and\nquantification of potential exposures in\nindividual cases.\nThis process also enables us to track those cases that\nhave been scheduled for trial and/or\nmediation.\nBased on professional judgment and experience\nin using these litigation management tools and\navailable information about current developments\nin all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses\nthe\nadequacy of current accruals and determines if\nadjustment of existing accruals, or establishment\nof new\naccruals, is required.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor\nadditional information about income tax-related\ncontingencies.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental\nlaws and regulations\nas other companies in our industry.\nThe most significant of these environmental\nlaws and regulations include,\namong others, the:\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs\nair emissions.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.\n\u25cf\nEuropean Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation,\nAuthorization and Restriction of Chemicals\n(REACH).\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act\n(CERCLA or\nSuperfund), which imposes liability on generators,\ntransporters and arrangers of hazardous substances\nat sites where hazardous substance releases have\noccurred or are threatening to occur.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA), which governs the treatment,\nstorage\nand disposal of solid waste.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators\nof onshore\nfacilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees\nof an area in which an offshore facility is located, and\nowners and operators of vessels are liable for\nremoval costs and damages that result from\na discharge\nof oil into navigable waters of the U.S.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know\nAct (EPCRA), which requires\nfacilities to report toxic chemical inventories\nwith local emergency planning committees and response\ndepartments.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater\nin underground\ninjection wells.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Department of the Interior regulations,\nwhich relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S.\nwaters and impose liability for the cost of pollution\ncleanup resulting from operations, as well as\npotential liability for pollution damages.\n\u25cf\nEuropean Union Trading Directive resulting in European\nEmissions Trading Scheme.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations\nset limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to\nwater,\nestablish water quality limits and establish standards\nand impose obligations for the remediation\nof releases of\nhazardous substances and hazardous wastes.\nThey also, in most cases, require permits in\nassociation with new\nor modified operations.\nThese permits can require an applicant to\ncollect substantial information in connection\nwith the application process, which can be expensive\nand time consuming.\nIn addition, there can be delays\nassociated with notice and comment periods and\nthe agency's processing of the application.\nMany of the\ndelays associated with the permitting process\nare beyond the control of the applicant.\nMany states and foreign countries where\nwe operate also have, or are developing, similar\nenvironmental laws\nand regulations governing these same types of\nactivities.\nWhile similar, in some cases these regulations may\nimpose additional, or more stringent, requirements\nthat can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing\nor\ntransporting products across state and international\nborders.\nThe ultimate financial impact arising from\nenvironmental laws and regulations is neither\nclearly known nor\neasily determinable as new standards, such as\nair emission standards and water quality standards,\ncontinue to\nevolve.\nHowever, environmental laws and regulations, including those that\nmay arise to address concerns\nabout global climate change, are expected to continue\nto have an increasing impact on our operations\nin the\nU.S. and in other countries in which we operate.\nNotable areas of potential impacts include air emission\ncompliance and remediation obligations in\nthe U.S. and Canada.\nAn example is the use of hydraulic fracturing,\nan essential completion technique that facilitates\nproduction of\noil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower\npermeability rock formations.\nA range of local, state, federal or\nnational laws and regulations currently govern\nhydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic\nfracturing\ncurrently prohibited in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic fracturing has been conducted\nfor many\ndecades, a number of new laws, regulations\nand permitting requirements are under consideration\nby various\nstate environmental agencies, and others which\ncould result in increased costs, operating restrictions,\noperational delays and/or limit the ability\nto develop oil and natural gas resources.\nGovernmental restrictions\non hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall\nprofitability or viability of certain of our oil\nand natural gas\ninvestments.\nWe have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards\ndesigned to\nmeet or exceed government requirements.\nOur practices continually evolve as technology\nimproves and\nregulations change.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation\nobligations\nassociated with current and past operations.\nSuch laws and regulations include CERCLA\nand RCRA and their\nstate equivalents.\nLonger-term expenditures are subject to considerable\nuncertainty and may fluctuate\nsignificantly.\nWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability\nfrom the EPA and state\nenvironmental agencies alleging we are a potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent\nstate\nstatute.\nOn occasion, we also have been made a party\nto cost recovery litigation by those agencies\nor by\nprivate parties.\nThese requests, notices and lawsuits assert\npotential liability for remediation costs at various\nsites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly\ncontain wastes attributable to our past operations.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, there were 15 sites around\nthe U.S. in which we were identified as\na potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA and comparable\nstate laws.\nFor most Superfund sites, our potential liability\nwill be significantly less than the total site\nremediation costs\nbecause the percentage of waste attributable\nto us, versus that attributable to all other\npotentially responsible\nparties, is relatively low.\nAlthough liability of those potentially\nresponsible is generally joint and several for\nfederal sites and frequently so for state sites,\nother potentially responsible parties at sites\nwhere we are a party\ntypically have had the financial strength to\nmeet their obligations, and where they have\nnot, or where\npotentially responsible parties could not be located,\nour share of liability has not increased materially.\nMany of\nthe sites at which we are potentially responsible\nare still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies\nconcerned.\nPrior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible\nnormally assess site conditions, apportion\nresponsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.\nIn some instances, we may have no liability\nor attain\na settlement of liability.\nActual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties\nobtain EPA or equivalent state\nagency approval.\nThere are relatively few sites where we\nare a major participant, and given the timing\nand\namounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the\ncost of remediation at those sites nor\nsuch costs at all\nCERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to\nhave a material adverse effect on our competitive\nor financial\ncondition.\nExpensed environmental costs were $393 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about $435 million\nper year\nin 2021 and 2022.\nCapitalized environmental costs were $161 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about\n$210 million per year in 2021 and 2022.\nAccrued liabilities for remediation activities\nare not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers\nor other\nthird parties and are not discounted (except those\nassumed in a purchase business combination,\nwhich we do\nrecord on a discounted basis).\nMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA,\nRCRA and similar state or international laws that\nrequire us to\nundertake certain investigative and remedial\nactivities at sites where we conduct, or once\nconducted,\noperations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated\nwaste was disposed.\nThe accrual also includes a number\nof sites we identified that may require environmental\nremediation, but which are not currently the\nsubject of\nCERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement\nactivities.\nThe laws that require or address environmental\nremediation may apply retroactively and regardless\nof fault, the legality of the original activities\nor the current\nownership or control of sites.\nIf applicable, we accrue receivables for probable\ninsurance or other third-party\nrecoveries.\nIn the future, we may incur significant costs\nunder both CERCLA and RCRA.\nRemediation activities vary substantially\nin duration and cost from site to site, depending on the\nmix of unique\nsite characteristics, evolving remediation technologies,\ndiverse regulatory agencies and enforcement\npolicies,\nand the presence or absence of potentially liable\nthird parties.\nTherefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable\nestimates of future site remediation costs.\nAt December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included\ntotal accrued environmental costs of\n$180 million,\ncompared with $171 million at December 31,\n2019, for remediation activities in the\nU.S. and Canada.\nWe\nexpect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures\nwithin the next 30 years.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as\nwith other companies engaged in similar businesses,\nenvironmental costs and liabilities are inherent\nconcerns in our operations and products, and there\ncan be no\nassurance that material costs and liabilities\nwill not be incurred.\nHowever, we currently do not expect any\nmaterial adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial\nposition as a result of compliance with\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nContinuing political and social attention to the\nissue of global climate change has resulted in a broad\nrange of\nproposed or promulgated state, national and international\nlaws focusing on GHG reduction.\nThese proposed or\npromulgated laws apply or could apply in countries\nwhere we have interests or may have interests\nin the future.\nLaws in this field continue to evolve, and\nwhile it is not possible to accurately estimate either\na timetable for\nimplementation or our future compliance costs\nrelating to implementation, such laws, if\nenacted, could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nExamples of legislation and precursors\nfor possible regulation that do or could affect our operations\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEuropean Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through\nwhich many of the EU member\nstates are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.\nOur cost of compliance with the EU ETS in\n2020 was\napproximately $7 million before-tax.\n\u25cf\nThe Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation\nrequires any existing\nfacility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000\nmetric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent,\nper year to meet a facility benchmark intensity.\nThe total cost of these regulations in 2020\nwas\napproximately $2 million.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts\nv. EPA\n,\n549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007),\nconfirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant\u201d\nunder the\nFederal Clean Air Act.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on March 29, 2010 (published\nas Interpretation of Regulations that\nDetermine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act\nPermitting Programs,\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April\n2,\n2010)), and the EPA's\nand U.S. Department of Transportation's joint promulgation of a Final Rule on\nApril 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs\nunder the Clean Air Act, may trigger more\nclimate-\nbased claims for damages, and may result in longer\nagency review time for development projects.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on January 14, 2015, outlining\na series of steps it plans to take to\naddress methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound\nemissions from the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe U.S. government established a goal of\nreducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions\nfrom the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent\nby 2025.\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.\nOur cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon\ntax legislation\nin 2020 was approximately $29 million (net\nshare before-tax).\nWe also incur a carbon tax for\nemissions from fossil fuel combustion in our\nBritish Columbia and Alberta operations in\nCanada,\ntotaling approximately $3.5 million (net share\nbefore-tax).\n\u25cf\nThe agreement reached in Paris in December 2015\nat the 21\nst\nConference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, setting out a process for achieving\nglobal\nemission reductions.\nThe new administration has recommitted\nthe United States to the Paris\nAgreement, and a significant number of U.S. state\nand local governments and major corporations\nheadquartered in the U.S. have also announced\nrelated commitments.\nIn the U.S., some additional form of regulation\nmay be forthcoming in the future at the\nfederal and state levels\nwith respect to GHG emissions.\nSuch regulation could take any of several\nforms that may result in the creation\nof additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction\nof output, investments of capital to maintain\ncompliance\nwith laws and regulations, or required acquisition\nor trading of emission allowances.\nWe are working to\ncontinuously improve operational and energy efficiency through\nresource and energy conservation throughout\nour operations.\nCompliance with changes in laws and regulations\nthat create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme\nor GHG\nreduction policies could significantly increase\nour costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived\nproducts,\nimpact the cost and availability of capital\nand increase our exposure to litigation.\nSuch laws and regulations\ncould also increase demand for less carbon intensive\nenergy sources, including natural gas.\nThe ultimate\nimpact on our financial performance, either positive\nor negative, will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding\nbut not limited to:\n\u25cf\nWhether and to what extent legislation or\nregulation is enacted.\n\u25cf\nThe timing of the introduction of such legislation\nor regulation.\n\u25cf\nThe nature of the legislation (such as a cap and\ntrade system or a tax on emissions) or\nregulation.\n\u25cf\nThe price placed on GHG emissions (either\nby the market or through a tax).\n\u25cf\nThe GHG reductions required.\n\u25cf\nThe price and availability of offsets.\n\u25cf\nThe amount and allocation of allowances.\n\u25cf\nTechnological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.\n\u25cf\nAny potential significant physical effects of climate\nchange (such as increased severe weather events,\nchanges in sea levels and changes in temperature).\n\u25cf\nWhether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are\nultimately reflected in the prices of\nour products and services.\nClimate Change Litigation\nBeginning in 2017, governmental and other entities\nin several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits\nagainst oil\nand gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages and equitable\nrelief to abate\nalleged climate change impacts.\nAdditional lawsuits with similar allegations\nare expected to be filed.\nThe\namounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal\nand factual issues involved in these cases are\nunprecedented.\nConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are\nfactually and legally meritless and are an\ninappropriate vehicle to address the challenges\nassociated with climate change and will\nvigorously defend\nagainst such lawsuits.\nSeveral Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana\nhave filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana's State and Local\nCoastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA)\nagainst oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages for contamination\nand erosion of the Louisiana coastline\nallegedly caused by\nhistorical oil and gas operations.\nConocoPhillips entities are defendants\nin 22 of the lawsuits and will\nvigorously defend against them.\nBecause Plaintiffs' SLCRMA theories are unprecedented,\nthere is uncertainty\nabout these claims (both as to scope and damages)\nand any potential financial impact on the company.\nCompany Response to Climate-Related Risks\nThe company has responded by putting in place\na Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard\ncovering the assessment and registering of significant\nand high sustainable development risks based\non their\nconsequence and likelihood of occurrence.\nWe have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan\nwith the goal of tracking mitigation activities\nfor each climate-related risk included in the corporate\nSustainable Development Risk Register.\nThe risks addressed in our Climate Change Action\nPlan fall into four broad categories:\n\u25cf\nGHG-related legislation and regulation.\n\u25cf\nGHG emissions management.\n\u25cf\nPhysical climate-related impacts.\n\u25cf\nClimate-related disclosure and reporting.\nEmissions are categorized into three different scopes.\nGross operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions\nhelp us understand our climate transition\nrisk.\n\u25cf\nScope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions\nfrom sources that we own or control.\n\u25cf\nScope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from\nthe generation of purchased electricity or\nsteam that we\nconsume.\nScope 3 emissions are indirect emissions\nfrom sources that we neither own nor control.\nWe announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework\nwith the objective of\nimplementing a coherent set of choices designed\nto facilitate the success of our existing exploration\nand\nproduction business through the energy transition.\nGiven the uncertainties remaining about how the\nenergy\ntransition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust\nacross a range of potential future outcomes.\nThe strategy is comprised of four pillars:\n\u25cf\nTargets:\nOur target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term\nambition that sets\nthe direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions\nintensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These\nperformance\ntargets are supported by lower-level internal business\nunit goals to enable the company to achieve the\ncompany-wide targets.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions\nintensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by\n2030, with an ambition to achieve net-zero\noperated\nemissions by 2050.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to work towards\nzero routine\nflaring of gas by 2030.\n\u25cf\nTechnology choices:\nWe expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader\nrange of opportunities for emission reduction\ntechnology.\n\u25cf\nPortfolio choices:\nOur corporate authorization process requires\nall qualifying projects to include a\nGHG price in their project approval economics.\nDifferent GHG prices are used depending on the\nregion or jurisdiction.\nProjects in jurisdictions with existing GHG\npricing regimes incorporate the\nexisting GHG price and forecast into their\neconomics.\nProjects where no existing GHG pricing\nregime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our\ninternally consistent World Energy Model.\nIn this\nway, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.\nThe\ncompany does not use an estimated market cost\nof GHG emissions when assessing reserves\nin\njurisdictions without existing GHG regulations.\n\u25cf\nExternal engagement: Our external engagement\naims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and\ngas sector with our approach to managing climate-related\nrisk.\nWe are a Founding Member of the\nClimate Leadership Council (CLC), an international\npolicy institute founded in collaboration\nwith\nbusiness and environmental interests to develop\na carbon dividend plan.\nParticipation in the CLC\nprovides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue\nabout carbon pricing and framing the issues\nin\nalignment with our public policy principles.\nWe also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon\nDividends, the education and advocacy branch of\nthe CLC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management\nto select appropriate\naccounting policies and to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses.\nSee Note 1-Accounting Policies, in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for descriptions of our major accounting\npolicies.\nCertain of these accounting policies involve\njudgments and uncertainties to such an extent there\nis a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts\nwould have been reported under different conditions, or if\ndifferent assumptions had been used.\nThese critical\naccounting estimates are discussed with the Audit\nand Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at\nleast\nannually.\nWe believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along\nwith the discussion of\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowances in this\nreport, address all important accounting\nareas where the nature\nof accounting estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary\nto\naccount for highly uncertain matters or the\nsusceptibility of such matters to change.\nOil and Gas Accounting\nAccounting for oil and gas exploratory activity\nis subject to special accounting rules unique\nto the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe acquisition of G&G seismic information,\nprior to the discovery of proved reserves, is\nexpensed\nas incurred, similar to accounting for research and\ndevelopment costs.\nHowever, leasehold acquisition costs\nand exploratory well costs are capitalized on the\nbalance sheet pending determination of whether\nproved oil\nand gas reserves have been recognized.\nProperty Acquisition Costs\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management\nperiodically assesses for impairment based on\nexploration\nand drilling efforts to date.\nFor relatively small individual leasehold acquisition\ncosts, management exercises\njudgment and determines a percentage probability\nthat the prospect ultimately will fail to find\nproved oil and\ngas reserves and pools that leasehold information\nwith others in the geographic area.\nFor prospects in areas\nwith limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling,\nthe percentage probability of ultimate failure\nis normally\njudged to be quite high.\nThis judgmental percentage is multiplied\nby the leasehold acquisition cost, and that\nproduct is divided by the contractual period\nof the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold\nimpairment\ncharge that is reported in exploration expense.\nThis judgmental probability percentage is reassessed\nand\nadjusted throughout the contractual period of the\nleasehold based on favorable or unfavorable\nexploratory\nactivity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds,\nand leasehold impairment amortization expense is\nadjusted\nprospectively.\nAt year-end 2020, the remaining $2.4 billion of net capitalized\nunproved property costs consisted primarily\nof\nindividually significant leaseholds, mineral rights\nheld in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory\nwells\ncurrently being drilled, suspended exploratory\nwells, and capitalized interest.\nOf this amount, approximately\n$1.9 billion is concentrated in 10 major development\nareas, the majority of which are not expected to\nmove to\nproved properties in 2021.\nManagement periodically assesses individually\nsignificant leaseholds for\nimpairment based on the results of exploration\nand drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\nExploratory Costs\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily\ncapitalized, or suspended,\u201d on the balance sheet,\npending\na determination of whether potentially economic\noil and gas reserves have been discovered by the\ndrilling\neffort to justify development.\nIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic\nquantities of oil and gas, the well costs\nremain capitalized\non the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing\nthe reserves and the economic and operating\nviability of the project is being made.\nThe accounting notion of sufficient progress\u201d is\na judgmental area, but\nthe accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization\nof suspended well costs on the expectation\nfuture\nmarket conditions will improve or new technologies\nwill be found that would make the development\neconomically profitable.\nOften, the ability to move into the development\nphase and record proved reserves is\ndependent on obtaining permits and government\nor co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is\nultimately\nbeyond our control.\nExploratory well costs remain suspended as long\nas we are actively pursuing such\napprovals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.\nOnce all required approvals and permits have\nbeen\nobtained, the projects are moved into the development\nphase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated\nas\nproved reserves.\nFor complex exploratory discoveries, it\nis not unusual to have exploratory wells remain\nsuspended on the balance sheet for several\nyears while we perform additional appraisal\ndrilling and seismic\nwork on the potential oil and gas field or while\nwe seek government or co-venturer approval of development\nplans or seek environmental permitting.\nOnce a determination is made the well did not\nencounter potentially\neconomic oil and gas quantities, the well costs\nare expensed as a dry hole and reported in\nexploration expense.\nManagement reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors\nthe results of the additional\nappraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses\nthe suspended well costs as a dry hole when it\ndetermines\nthe potential field does not warrant further\ninvestment in the near term.\nCriteria utilized in making this\ndetermination include evaluation of the reservoir\ncharacteristics and hydrocarbon properties,\nexpected\ndevelopment costs, ability to apply existing technology\nto produce the reserves, fiscal terms,\nregulations or\ncontract negotiations, and our expected return\non investment.\nAt year-end 2020,\ntotal suspended well costs were $682 million,\ncompared with $1,020 million at year-end\n2019.\nFor additional information on suspended wells,\nincluding an aging analysis, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProved Reserves\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves\nare inherently imprecise and represent only\napproximate amounts because of the judgments involved\nin developing such information.\nReserve estimates\nare based on geological and engineering assessments\nof in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production\nplan,\nhistorical extraction recovery and processing yield\nfactors, installed plant operating capacity\nand approved\noperating limits.\nThe reliability of these estimates at any point\nin time depends on both the quality and\nquantity of the technical and economic data\nand the efficiency of extracting and processing the\nhydrocarbons.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering\nestimates, accounting rules require disclosure\nof\nproved\u201d reserve estimates due to the importance\nof these estimates to better understand the perceived\nvalue\nand future cash flows of a company's operations.\nThere are several authoritative guidelines\nregarding the\nengineering criteria that must be met before estimated\nreserves can be designated as proved.\u201d\nOur\ngeosciences and reservoir engineering organization\nhas policies and procedures in place consistent\nwith these\nauthoritative guidelines.\nWe have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate\nour\nproved reserves held by consolidated companies, as\nwell as our share of equity affiliates.\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually\nin the fourth quarter and during the year\nif significant changes\noccur, and take into account recent production and subsurface\ninformation about each field.\nAlso, as required\nby current authoritative guidelines, the estimated\nfuture date when an asset will reach the end\nof its economic\nlife is based on 12-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will end and\naffects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the\nestimate of proved reserves also changes.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and\nincrease as prices rise.\nOur proved reserves include estimated quantities\nrelated to PSCs, reported under the economic interest\u201d\nmethod, as well as variable-royalty regimes,\nand are subject to fluctuations in commodity\nprices; recoverable\noperating expenses; and capital costs.\nIf costs remain stable, reserve quantities\nattributable to recovery of costs\nwill change inversely to changes in commodity\nprices.\nWe would expect reserves from these contracts to\ndecrease when product prices rise and increase\nwhen prices decline.\nThe estimation of proved developed reserves also\nis important to the income statement because\nthe proved\ndeveloped reserve estimate for a field serves as the\ndenominator in the unit-of-production\ncalculation of the\nDD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset.\nAt year-end 2020, the net book value of productive PP&E\nsubject to a unit-of-production calculation was\napproximately $33 billion and the DD&A recorded\non these\nassets in 2020 was approximately $5.3 billion.\nThe estimated proved developed reserves for\nour consolidated\noperations were 3.2 billion BOE at the end\nof 2019 and 2.5 billion BOE at the end of\n2020.\nIf the estimates of\nproved reserves used in the unit-of-production\ncalculations had been lower by 10 percent\nacross all\ncalculations, before-tax DD&A in 2020\nwould have increased by an estimated $588\nmillion.\nImpairments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed\nfor impairment whenever changes in facts\nand circumstances\nindicate a possible significant deterioration\nin future cash flows expected to be generated\nby an asset group.\nIf\nthere is an indication the carrying amount of\nan asset may not be recovered, a recoverability\ntest is performed\nusing management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development\nplans.\nIf, upon review, the sum\nof the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes\nis less than the carrying value of the asset\ngroup, the\ncarrying value is written down to estimated fair\nvalue and reported as impairments in the\nperiods in which the\ndetermination is made.\nIndividual assets are grouped for impairment\npurposes at the lowest level for which\nthere are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent\nof the cash flows of other groups of assets-\ngenerally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets.\nBecause there usually is a lack of quoted\nmarket prices for\nlong-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets\nis typically determined based on the present\nvalues of\nexpected future cash flows using discount rates\nand prices believed to be consistent with\nthose used by\nprincipal market participants,\nor based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated\nwith historical market\ntransactions of similar assets where possible.\nThe expected future cash flows used for\nimpairment reviews and\nrelated fair value calculations are based on estimated\nfuture production volumes, commodity\nprices, operating\ncosts and capital decisions, considering all\navailable information at the date of review.\nDiffering assumptions\ncould affect the timing and the amount of an impairment\nin any period.\nSee Note 8-Impairments, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional information.\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities\naccounted for under the equity method are assessed\nfor impairment\nwhenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate\na loss in value has occurred.\nSuch evidence of a loss\nin value might include our inability to\nrecover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained\nearnings capacity\nwhich would justify the current investment amount,\nor a current fair value less than the investment's carrying\namount.\nWhen such a condition is judgmentally determined\nto be other than temporary, an impairment charge\nis recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated\nfair value.\nWhen\ndetermining whether a decline in value is other than\ntemporary, management considers factors such as the\nlength of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition\nand near-term prospects, and our\nability and intention to retain our investment for\na period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in the market value of the investment.\nSince quoted market prices are usually not\navailable, the fair\nvalue is typically based on the present value\nof expected future cash flows using discount\nrates and prices\nbelieved to be consistent with those used by principal\nmarket participants, plus market analysis\nof comparable\nassets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nDiffering assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of\nan impairment of an investment in any period.\nSee the APLNG\u201d section of Note 5-Investments,\nLoans and\nLong-Term Receivables,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs\nUnder various contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have material legal obligations to remove\ntangible\nequipment and restore the land or seabed at the\nend of operations at operational sites.\nOur largest asset\nremoval obligations involve plugging and abandonment\nof wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and\ngas\nplatforms around the world, as well as oil and gas\nproduction facilities and pipelines in Alaska.\nThe fair values\nof obligations for dismantling and removing these\nfacilities are recorded as a liability and\nan increase to PP&E\nat the time of installation of the asset based on estimated\ndiscounted costs.\nFair value is estimated using a\npresent value approach, incorporating assumptions\nabout estimated amounts and timing of settlements\nand\nimpacts of the use of technologies.\nEstimating future asset removal costs requires\nsignificant judgement.\nMost\nof these removal obligations are many years, or decades,\nin the future and the contracts and regulations\noften\nhave vague descriptions of what removal practices\nand criteria must be met when the removal\nevent actually\noccurs.\nThe carrying value of our asset retirement\nobligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset\nremoval technologies and costs, regulatory and other\ncompliance considerations, expenditure timing,\nand other\ninputs into valuation of the obligation, including\ndiscount and inflation rates, which are all\nsubject to change\nbetween the time of initial recognition of the liability\nand future settlement of our obligation.\nNormally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement\nas increases or decreases\nto DD&A over the remaining life of the assets.\nHowever, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as\nwell as previously sold assets for which we\nretained the asset removal obligation, an increase\nin the asset\nremoval obligation can result in an immediate\ncharge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E\ndue to the\nincreased obligation would immediately be subject\nto impairment, due to the low fair value of these\nproperties.\nIn addition to asset removal obligations, under the\nabove or similar contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have\ncertain environmental-related projects.\nThese are primarily related to remediation\nactivities required by\nCanada and various states\nwithin the U.S. at exploration and production sites.\nFuture environmental\nremediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are\nsubject to change due to such factors as the\nuncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown\ntime and extent of such remedial actions\nthat may be\nrequired, and the determination of our liability\nin proportion to that of other responsible parties.\nSee Note 9-\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental\nCosts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nProjected Benefit Obligations\nDetermination of the projected benefit obligations\nfor our defined benefit pension and postretirement\nplans are\nimportant to the recorded amounts for such obligations\non the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit\nexpense in the income statement.\nThe actuarial determination of projected benefit\nobligations and company\ncontribution requirements involves judgment about\nuncertain future events, including estimated\nretirement\ndates, salary levels at retirement, mortality\nrates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan\nassets, future\nhealth care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization\nof health care services by retirees.\nDue to the specialized\nnature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial\nfirms to assist in the determination of these\nprojected\nbenefit obligations and company contribution requirements.\nFor Employee Retirement Income Security Act-\ngoverned pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary\ncare on behalf of plan participants in the\ndetermination\nof the judgmental assumptions used in determining\nrequired company contributions into the\nplans.\nDue to\ndiffering objectives and requirements between financial\naccounting rules and the pension plan funding\nregulations promulgated by governmental agencies,\nthe actuarial methods and assumptions\nfor the two\npurposes differ in certain important respects.\nUltimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under\npension and postretirement benefit plans not\nfunded by plan assets or investment returns,\nbut the judgmental\nassumptions used in the actuarial calculations\nsignificantly affect periodic financial statements and funding\npatterns over time.\nProjected benefit obligations are particularly\nsensitive to the discount rate assumption.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase projected benefit obligations\nby\n$1,200 million.\nBenefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate\nand return on plan assets assumptions.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase annual benefit expense by\n$110 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return\non plan assets assumption would increase annual\nbenefit expense by $80 million.\nIn determining the discount rate, we use yields\non high-quality fixed income\ninvestments matched to the estimated benefit\ncash flows of our plans.\nWe are also exposed to the possibility\nthat lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension\nplans during the year could exceed the total of\nservice\nand interest components of annual pension expense\nand trigger accelerated recognition of a portion\nof\nunrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.\nThese benefit payments are based on decisions\nby plan\nparticipants and are therefore difficult to predict.\nIn the event there is a significant reduction in the\nexpected\nyears of future service of present employees or the\nelimination of the accrual of defined benefits\nfor some or all\nof their future services for a significant number\nof employees, we could recognize a curtailment\ngain or loss.\nSee Note 17-Employee Benefit Plans, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional\ninformation.\nContingencies\nA number of claims and lawsuits are made against\nthe company arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\nManagement exercises judgment related to accounting\nand disclosure of these claims which includes\nlosses,\ndamages, and underpayments associated with environmental\nremediation, tax, contracts, and other legal\ndisputes.\nAs we learn new facts concerning contingencies,\nwe reassess our position both with respect to\namounts recognized and disclosed considering changes\nto the probability of additional losses and potential\nexposure.\nHowever, actual losses can and do vary from estimates\nfor a variety of reasons including legal,\narbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement\ndiscussions; evaluation of scope of damages;\ninterpretation of regulatory or contractual terms;\nexpected timing of future actions; and proportion\nof liability\nshared with other responsible parties.\nEstimated future costs related to contingencies\nare subject to change as\nevents evolve and as additional information becomes\navailable during the administrative and litigation\nprocesses.\nFor additional information on contingent\nliabilities, see the Contingencies\u201d section\nwithin Capital\nResources and Liquidity\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies\nand Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.\nWe record deferred tax assets and\nliabilities to account for the expected future tax\nconsequences of events that have been recognized\nin our\nfinancial statements and our tax returns.\nWe routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by\na valuation allowance if we deem it is more\nlikely than not that some portion, or all,\nof the deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for adjustments\nto existing valuation allowances, we consider all\navailable positive and negative evidence. Positive\nevidence includes reversals of temporary\ndifferences,\nforecasts of future taxable income, assessment of\nfuture business assumptions and applicable\ntax planning\nstrategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative\nevidence includes losses in recent years\nas well as the\nforecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable\nperiod. In making our assessment regarding\nvaluation\nallowances, we weight the evidence based on\nobjectivity.\nNumerous judgments and assumptions are inherent\nin the determination of future taxable income, including\nfactors such as future operating conditions\nand the\nassessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal\nincome taxes (particularly as related to prevailing\noil and gas prices).\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that\ncould result from\nassessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions\nin countries where we operate.\nWe recognize a tax benefit\nfrom an uncertain tax position when it is more\nlikely than not that the position will be sustained\nupon\nexamination, based on the technical merits\nof the position.\nThese accruals for uncertain tax positions are\nsubject to a significant amount of judgment and\nare reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis\nin light of\nchanging facts and circumstances considering the\nprogress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings,\nchanges in\napplicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and\nlegislative guidance, or expiration of the\napplicable statute\nof limitations.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial\nStatements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nFOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR\u201d\nPROVISIONS OF\nTHE PRIVATE\nSECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis report

E&P company\nwith operations and activities in 15 countries.\nOur diverse,\nlow cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich\nunconventional plays in North America;\nconventional\nassets in North America, Europe and Asia;\nLNG developments; oil sands assets in Canada;\nand an inventory of\nglobal conventional and unconventional exploration\nprospects.\nHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, at\nDecember 31, 2020, we employed approximately\n9,700 people worldwide and had total\nassets of $63 billion.\nCompleted Acquisition of Concho Resources Inc.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition\nof Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), an independent\noil\nand gas exploration and production company\nwith operations across New Mexico and West Texas.\nThe\naddition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland Basins creates a sizeable\nPermian presence to\naugment our leading unconventional positions\nin the Eagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48\nand the Montney\nin Canada.\nConsideration for the all-stock transaction was\nvalued at $13.1 billion, in which 1.46 shares\nof ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock was exchanged for each outstanding\nshare of Concho common stock, resulting\nin the issuance\nof approximately 286 million shares of ConocoPhillips\ncommon stock.\nWe also assumed $3.9 billion in\naggregate principal amount of outstanding debt for\nConcho, which was recorded at fair value of $4.7\nbillion as\nof the closing date.\nThe combined companies are expected to\ncapture approximately $750 million of annual\ncost and capital savings by 2022.\nFor additional information\nrelated to this transaction, see Note 25-\nAcquisition of Concho Resources Inc. in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nThe energy landscape changed dramatically in 2020 with\nsimultaneous demand and supply shocks that drove\nthe industry into a severe downturn.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic,\nwhich\ncontinues to have unprecedented social and economic\nconsequences.\nMitigation efforts to stop the spread of\nthis highly-contagious disease include stay-at-home\norders and business closures that caused\nsharp\ncontractions in economic activity worldwide.\nThe supply shock was triggered by disagreements\nbetween\nOPEC and Russia, beginning in early March 2020,\nwhich resulted in significant supply coming\nonto the\nmarket\nand an oil price war.\nThese dual demand and supply shocks caused\noil prices to collapse as we exited\nthe first quarter of 2020.\nAs we entered the second quarter of 2020, predictions\nof COVID-19 driven global oil demand losses\nintensified, with forecasts\nof unprecedented demand declines.\nBased on these forecasts, OPEC plus nations\nheld an emergency meeting, and in April they announced\na coordinated production cut that was unprecedented\nin both its magnitude and duration.\nThe OPEC plus agreement spans from May 2020\nuntil April 2022, with\nthe volume of production cuts easing over time.\nAdditionally, non-OPEC plus countries, including the U.S.,\nCanada, Brazil and other G-20 countries,\nannounced organic reductions to production through the\nrelease of\ndrilling rigs, frac crews, normal field decline\nand curtailments.\nDespite these planned production decreases,\nthe supply cuts were not timely enough to overcome\nsignificant demand decline.\nFutures prices for April WTI\nclosed under $20 a barrel for the first time\nsince 2001, followed by May WTI settling below zero on the\nday\nbefore futures contracts expiry, as holders of May futures contracts struggled to exit\npositions and avoid taking\nphysical delivery.\nAs storage constraints approached, spot prices in\nApril for certain North American\nlandlocked grades of crude oil were in the single digits\nor even negative for particularly remote or low-grade\ncrudes, while waterborne priced crudes such as\nBrent sold at a relative advantage.\nThe extreme volatility\nexperienced\nin the first half of the year settled down in the\nsecond half of the year, with WTI crude oil prices\nexiting the year near $50 per barrel.\nSince the start of the severe downturn, we have closely\nmonitored the market and taken prudent actions in\nresponse to this situation.\nWe entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of\nmore than $5 billion, short-term investments\nof $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility\nof $6 billion, totaling\napproximately $14 billion in available liquidity.\nAdditionally, we had several entity and asset sales\nagreements in place, which generated $1.3 billion\nin proceeds from dispositions during 2020.\nFor more\ninformation about the sales of our Australia-West and non-core Lower 48 assets, see\nNote 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and Dispositions in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThis relative advantage\nallowed us to be measured in our response to\nthe sudden change in business environment.\nIn March, we announced an initial set of actions\nto address the downturn and followed up with additional\nactions in April.\nThe combined announcements reflected a reduction\nin our 2020 operating plan capital of $2.3\nbillion, a reduction to our operating costs of\n$600 million and suspension of our share\nrepurchase program.\nThese actions decreased uses of cash by approximately\n$5 billion in 2020.\nWe also established a framework\nfor evaluating our assets and implementing\neconomic production curtailments considering\nthe weakness in oil\nprices during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted\nin taking an additional significant step of voluntarily\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nIn the second quarter, we curtailed production by an estimated 225 MBOED,\nwith 145 MBOED of the\ncurtailments from the Lower 48, 40 MBOED from\nAlaska and 30 MBOED from our Surmont operation\nin\nCanada.\nThe remainder of the second-quarter curtailments\nwere primarily in Malaysia.\nOther industry\noperators also cut production and development\nplans and as we progressed through the second quarter, certain\nstay-at-home restrictions eased, which partially\nrestored lost demand, and WTI and Brent prices\nexited the\nsecond quarter around $40 per barrel.\nBased on our economic framework, we began\nrestoring production from\nvoluntary curtailments in July, and with oil stabilizing around $40 per barrel, we\nended our curtailment\nprogram during the third quarter.\nCurtailments in the third quarter averaged approximately\n90 MBOED, with\n65 MBOED attributable to the Lower 48 and 15 MBOED\nto Surmont.\nIn August 2020, we acquired\nadditional Montney acreage for cash consideration\nof $382 million, after\ncustomary post-closing adjustments.\nWe also assumed $31 million in financing obligations for associated\npartially owned infrastructure.\nThis acquisition consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties and included\n140,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Inga Fireweed\nasset Montney zone, which is directly adjacent\nto our\nexisting Montney position.\nThe transaction increased our Montney acreage\nposition to approximately 295,000\nnet acres with a 100 percent working interest.\nSee Note 4-Acquisitions and Dispositions in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\nIn October 2020, we announced an increase to our\nquarterly dividend from $0.42 per share to $0.43\nper share\nand resumed\nshare repurchases before suspending our\nshare repurchase program upon entry into\nour definitive\nagreement to acquire Concho.\nWe resumed shares repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our\nConcho acquisition.\nWe ended the year with over $12 billion of liquidity, comprised of $3.0 billion in cash\nand cash equivalents, $3.6 billion in short-term\ninvestments, and available borrowings under our credit\nfacility\nof $5.7 billion.\nOur expectation is that commodity prices will\nremain cyclical and volatile, and a successful\nbusiness strategy\nin the E&P industry must be resilient in\nlower price environments, at the same time retaining\nupside during\nperiods of higher prices.\nWhile we are not impervious to current market\nconditions, we believe our decisive\nactions over the last several years of focusing on free\ncash flow generation, high-grading our asset\nbase,\nlowering the cost of supply of our investment\nresource portfolio, and strengthening our\nbalance sheet have put\nus in a strong relative position compared to our\nindependent E&P peers.\nWe remain committed to the core\nprinciples of our value proposition, namely, free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet, commitment to\ndifferential returns of and on capital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOur workforce and operations have adjusted to\nmitigate the impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nWe have\noperations in remote areas with confined spaces,\nsuch as offshore platforms, the North Slope of Alaska,\nCurtis\nIsland in Australia, western Canada and Indonesia,\nwhere viruses could rapidly spread.\nPersonnel are asked to\nperform a self-assessment for symptoms of illness\neach day and, when appropriate, are subject to\nmore\nrestrictive measures before traveling to and working\non location.\nStaffing levels in certain operating locations\nhave been reduced to minimize health risk exposure\nand increase social distancing.\nA portion of our office\nstaff have continued to work successfully remotely, with offices around the world carefully\ndesigning and\nexecuting a flexible, phased reentry, following national, state and local guidelines.\nThese mitigation measures\nhave thus far been effective at reducing business operation\ndisruptions.\nWorkforce health and safety remains\nthe overriding driver for our actions and we have\ndemonstrated our ability to adapt to local\nconditions as\nwarranted.\nThe marketing and supply chain\nside of our business has also adapted in response\nto COVID-19.\nOur\ncommercial organization managed transportation commitments\nduring our voluntary curtailment program.\nOur supply chain function is proactively working\nwith vendors to ensure the continuity of our business\noperations, monitor distressed service and materials\nproviders, capture deflation opportunities, and pursue\ncost\nreduction efforts.\nWe also enhanced our focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period\nand\nrequested credit assurances when applicable.\nOperationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business.\nIn 2020, production of 1,127 MBOED\ngenerated cash provided by operating activities\nof $4.8 billion.\nWe invested $4.7\nbillion into the business in\nthe form of capital expenditures, including $0.5\nbillion of acquisition capital, and paid dividends\nto\nshareholders of $1.8 billion.\nProduction decreased 221 MBOED or 16 percent\nin 2020, compared to 2019.\nProduction excluding\nLibya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions\nand dispositions;\nand excluding Libya, production for 2020\nwould have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15\nMBOED compared with 2019 production.\nThis decrease\nwas primarily due to normal field decline, partly\noffset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway,\nAlaska and China.\nProduction from Libya averaged 9 MBOED\nas it was in force majeure during a significant\nportion of the year.\nKey Operating and Financial Summary\nSignificant items during 2020 and recent announcements\nincluded the following:\n\u25cf\nEnhanced both our portfolio and financial framework through the\nacquisition of Concho in an all-stock\ntransaction, as well as purchasing bolt-on acreage in Canada and Lower\n48.\n\u25cf\nFull-year production, excluding Libya, of 1,118\nMBOED; curtailed approximately 80 MBOED during the\nyear.\n\u25cf\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion.\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.3 billion in disposition proceeds from non-core asset sales.\n\u25cf\nDistributed $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $0.9 billion of shares.\n\u25cf\nEnded the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.0 billion and\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion,\nequaling $6.6 billion in ending cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\u25cf\nAnnounced two significant discoveries in Norway and achieved first production\nat Tor II; continued\nappraisal drilling and started up first pads and related infrastructure\nin Montney.\n\u25cf\nAdopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework with ambition to achieve net\n-zero operated emissions by\n2050 as part of our commitment to ESG excellence.\n\u25cf\nRecognized impairments of proved and unproved properties totaling $1.3\nbillion after-tax.\nBusiness Environment\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $42 per barrel in 2020,\ncompared with $64 per barrel in 2019.\nThe energy\nindustry has periodically experienced this type\nof volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand\nconditions\nand such volatility may persist for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nCommodity prices are the most significant\nfactor\nimpacting our profitability and related reinvestment\nof operating cash flows into our business.\nOur strategy is\nto create value through price cycles by delivering\non the foundational principles that underpin our\nvalue\nproposition; free cash flow generation,\na strong balance sheet,\ncommitment to differential returns of and on\ncapital,\nand ESG leadership.\nOperational and Financial Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nThe focus areas we believe will drive our success\nthrough the price cycles include:\n\u25cf\nFree cash flow generation.\nThis is a core principle of our value proposition.\nOur goal is to achieve\nstrong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline,\ncontrolling our costs, and safely and reliably\ndelivering production.\nThroughout the price cycles, we expect to make capital\ninvestments sufficient\nto sustain production.\nFree cash flow provides funds that are available\nto return to shareholders,\nstrengthen the balance sheet to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles, or reinvest back into\nthe business for future cash flow expansion.\no\nMaintain capital allocation discipline.\nWe participate in a commodity price-driven and\ncapital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment\ndecision is made\nto the time an asset is operational and generates cash\nflow.\nAs a result, we must invest\nsignificant capital dollars to explore for new oil\nand gas fields, develop newly discovered\nfields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines\nand LNG facilities.\nWe allocate\ncapital across a geographically diverse, low cost\nof supply resource base, which combined\nwith legacy assets results in low production decline.\nCost of supply is the WTI equivalent\nprice that generates a 10 percent after-tax return\non a point-forward and fully burdened basis.\nFully burdened includes capital infrastructure,\nforeign exchange, price related inflation and\nG&A.\nIn setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous\napproach that evaluates projects\nusing this cost of supply criteria, which we believe\nwill lead to value maximization and cash\nflow expansion using an optimized investment\npace, not production growth for growth's sake.\nOur cash allocation priorities call for the investment\nof sufficient capital to sustain production\nand pay the existing dividend.\nAdditional capital may be allocated toward\ngrowth, but\ndiscipline will be maintained.\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of\n$5.5 billion.\nThe plan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for\ninvestment in major projects, primarily in\nAlaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the\ncombined company of approximately 1.5 MMBOED\nin 2021.\nThis production guidance\nexcludes Libya.\no\nControl costs and expenses.\nControlling operating and overhead costs,\nwithout compromising\nsafety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority.\nWe monitor these costs using\nvarious methodologies that are reported to senior management\nmonthly, on both an absolute-\ndollar basis and a per-unit basis.\nManaging operating and overhead costs is\ncritical to\nmaintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity\nprice\nenvironment.\nThe ability to control our operating and overhead\ncosts impacts our ability to\ndeliver strong cash from operations.\nIn 2020, our production and operating expenses\nwere 18\npercent lower than 2019, primarily due to decreased\nwellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from production curtailments across\nour North American operated assets as well as\nthe absence of costs related to our U.K. and\nAustralia-West divestitures.\nFor more\ninformation related to our U.K. and Australia-West divestitures, see note 4-Acquisitions\nand\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nAt the time of the Concho acquisition announcement\nin October 2020, we announced planned\ncost reductions and quantified $350 million\nof annual expense savings expected to be\nachieved by 2022.\nThese reductions included approximately $150 million\ndue to streamlining\nour internal organization to appropriate levels given the\ncurrent industry environment and\nrecent asset sales; $100 million of G&A and\nG&G due to a refocused exploration program;\nand $100 million of redundant G&A costs on\na combined basis related to the Concho\nacquisition.\nSubsequent to the transaction announcement,\nwe identified $250 million of\nfurther cost reductions from the combined companies\nto be achieved by 2022.\no\nOptimize our portfolio.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho and\nsignificantly increased our unconventional portfolio\nwith years of low cost of supply\ninvestments.\nThe addition of complementary acreage in the\nDelaware and Midland basins\ncreates a sizeable Permian presence to augment our leading\nunconventional positions in the\nEagle Ford and Bakken in the Lower 48.\nWe added to our unconventional Montney position\nwith an asset acquisition that consisted primarily\nof undeveloped properties directly adjacent\nto our existing acreage.\nThese acquisitions followed several non-core asset\nsales earlier in the year including\nAustralia-West in our Asia Pacific segment,\nand Niobrara and Waddell Ranch in the Lower\n48.\nWe managed the portfolio well during a turbulent year, with asset sales entered at the end\nof 2019 generating $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions\nin the first half of 2020,\nfollowed by opportunistic acquisitions of unconventional\nassets in the second half of 2020\nafter commodity prices had dropped.\nWe will continue to evaluate our assets to determine\nwhether they compete for capital within our portfolio\nand will optimize the portfolio as\nnecessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments.\n\u25cf\nA strong balance sheet.\nWe believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as\nours.\nOur strong operating performance buffered by a solid\nbalance sheet enables us to deliver on our\npriorities through the price cycles.\nOur priorities include execution of our\ndevelopment plans,\nmaintaining a growing dividend, and returning competitive\nreturns of capital to shareholders.\n\u25cf\nCommitment to differential returns of and on capital.\nWe believe in delivering value to our\nshareholders via a growing, sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by additional returns of\ncapital,\nincluding share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid dividends on our common stock\nof approximately $1.8\nbillion and repurchased $0.9\nbillion of our common stock.\nCombined, our dividend and repurchases\nrepresented\n57 percent of our net cash provided by operating\nactivities.\nSince we initiated our current\nshare repurchase program in late 2016, we have repurchased\n189 million shares for $10.5 billion,\nwhich represents approximately 15 percent of shares\noutstanding as of September 30, 2016.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, $14.5 billion of repurchase\nauthority remained of the $25 billion share repurchase\nprogram our Board of Directors had authorized.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion,\nat prevailing prices, subject to market conditions\nand other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors Our\nability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase\nshares is subject to certain considerations.\u201d\nIn October 2020, we announced that our Board\nof Directors approved an increase to our quarterly\ndividend of $0.42 per share to $0.43 per share.\nIn February 2021, we resumed share repurchases\nafter\nthe completion of our Concho acquisition.\n\u25cf\nESG Leadership.\nSafety and environmental stewardship,\nincluding the operating integrity of our\nassets, remain our highest priorities, and we\nare committed to protecting the health and\nsafety of\neveryone who has a role in our operations and\nthe communities in which we operate.\nWe strive to\nconduct our business with respect and care for\nboth the local and global environment and\nsystematically manage risk to drive sustainable business\ngrowth.\nDemonstrating our commitment to\nsustainability and environmental stewardship, in\nOctober 2020, we announced our adoption of a Paris-\naligned climate risk framework as part of our continued\nleadership in ESG excellence.\nThis\ncomprehensive climate risk strategy should enable\nus to sustainably meet global energy demand while\ndelivering competitive returns through the energy transition.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross\noperated (scope 1 and 2) emissions intensity\nby 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030,\nwith an\nambition to achieve net zero by 2050 for operated\nemissions.\nWe are advocating for reduction of\nscope 3 end-use emissions intensity through our\nsupport for a U.S. carbon price and reaffirmed\nour\ncommitment to the Climate Leadership Council.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to\nwork towards zero routine flaring of gas by 2030\nand are the first U.S.-based oil and gas company\nto\nadopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy.\n\u25cf\nAdd to our proved reserve base.\nWe primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:\no\nPurchases of increased interests in existing\nfields and acquisitions.\no\nApplication of new technologies and processes\nto improve recovery from existing fields.\no\nSuccessful exploration, exploitation and development\nof new and existing fields.\nAs required by current authoritative guidelines,\nthe estimated future date when an asset will reach\nthe\nend of its economic life is based on historical 12-month\nfirst-of-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will\nend and affects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the estimate of proved reserves also\nchanges.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices\nrise.\nReserve replacement represents the net change in\nproved reserves, net of production, divided\nby our\ncurrent year production, as shown in our supplemental\nreserve table disclosures.\nOur reserve\nreplacement was negative 86 percent in 2020, reflecting\nthe impact of lower prices, which reduced\nreserves by approximately 600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas negative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, primarily\nimpacted by lower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended\nDecember 31, 2020, which excluded\na net increase of 89 MMBOE related to sales\nand purchases, was\n53 percent.\nAccess to additional resources may become increasingly\ndifficult as commodity prices can make\nprojects uneconomic or unattractive.\nIn addition, prohibition of direct investment\nin some nations,\nnational fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies,\nand lack of access\nto high-potential areas due to environmental or other\nregulation may negatively impact our\nability to\nincrease our reserve base.\nAs such, the timing and level at which we add\nto our reserve base may, or\nmay not, allow us to replace our production\nover subsequent years.\n\u25cf\nApply technical capability.\nWe leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely\ndeliver on our plans.\nTechnical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically\nconvert\nadditional resources to reserves, achieve greater\noperating efficiencies and reduce our environmental\nimpact.\nCompanywide, we continue to leverage knowledge\nof technological successes across our\noperations.\nWe have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to\nwork and operate\nmore efficiently.\nPredictive analytics have been adopted in our operations\nand planning process.\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning and\ndeep learning are being used for emissions\nmonitoring,\nseismic advancements and advanced controls in\nour field operations.\n\u25cf\nAttract, develop and retain a talented work force.\nWe strive to attract, develop and retain individuals\nwith the knowledge and skills to successfully\nexecute our business strategy in a manner\nexemplifying\nour core values and ethics.\nWe offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the\nbest early career talent.\nWe also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad\nrange of expertise and experience.\nWe promote continued learning, development and technical\ntraining through structured development programs\ndesigned to enhance the technical and functional\nskills of our employees.\nOther Factors Affecting\nProfitability\nOther significant factors that can affect our profitability\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEnergy commodity prices.\nOur earnings and operating cash flows generally\ncorrelate with industry\nprice levels for crude oil and natural gas.\nIndustry price levels are subject to factors external\nto the\ncompany and over which we have no control, including\nbut not limited to global economic health,\nsupply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil\nunrest or military conflicts, actions taken by\nOPEC\nand other producing countries, environmental laws,\ntax regulations, governmental policies and\nweather-related disruptions.\nThe following graph depicts the average benchmark\nprices for WTI\ncrude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural\ngas:\nBrent crude oil prices averaged $41.68 per barrel\nin 2020, a decrease of 35 percent compared\nwith\n$64.30 per barrel in 2019.\nSimilarly, WTI crude oil prices decreased 31 percent from $57.02 per\nbarrel in 2019 to $39.37 per barrel in 2020.\nCrude oil prices were lower due to the dual\ndemand and\nsupply shocks.\nThe demand shock was triggered by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which continues to\nhave unprecedented social and economic consequences.\nThe supply shock was triggered by\ndisagreements between OPEC and Russia, beginning\nin early March 2020, which resulted in\nsignificant supply coming onto the market\nand created higher inventory levels.\nHenry Hub natural gas prices\ndecreased 21 percent from an average of $2.63\nper MMBTU in 2019 to\n$2.08 per MMBTU in 2020.\nHenry Hub prices were depressed due to high\nstorage levels and weak\ndemand.\nOur realized bitumen price decreased 75 percent\nfrom an average of $31.72 per barrel\nin 2019 to $8.02\nper barrel in 2020.\nThe decrease was largely driven by weakness in WTI,\nreflective of impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe WCS differential to WTI at Hardisty remained fairly\nflat as\ncurtailment orders imposed by the Alberta Government,\nwhich limited production from the province,\ncontinued throughout 2020.\nWe continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through\nimprovements in alternate blend capability which\nresults in lower diluent costs and access\nto the U.S.\nGulf Coast market through rail and pipeline contracts.\nOur worldwide annual average realized price decreased\n34 percent from $48.78\nper BOE in 2019 to\n$32.15\nper BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized\noil, natural gas and bitumen prices.\nNorth America's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource\nscarcity to one\nof abundance.\nIn recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing\nand horizontal drilling in\nunconventional formations has led to increased industry\nactual and forecasted crude oil and natural\ngas production in the U.S.\nAlthough providing significant short-\nand long-term growth opportunities\nfor our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development\nof\nunconventional plays could also have adverse financial\nimplications to us, including: an extended\nperiod of low commodity prices; production curtailments;\nand delay of plans to develop areas such as\nunconventional fields.\nShould one or more of these events occur, our revenues would\nbe reduced, and\nadditional asset impairments might be possible.\n\u25cf\nImpairments.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry.\nAt times, our PP&E and investments\nbecome impaired when, for example, commodity\nprices decline significantly for long\nperiods of time,\nour reserve estimates are revised downward, or a\ndecision to dispose of an asset leads to\na write-down\nto its fair value.\nWe may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory\ndrilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material\nimpairment of leasehold values.\nAs we optimize\nour assets in the future, it is reasonably possible\nwe may incur future losses upon sale or\nimpairment\ncharges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments\nin nonconsolidated entities accounted for\nunder the equity method, and unproved properties.\nFor additional information on our impairments,\nsee Note 7-Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses and Note 8-Impairments, in\nthe Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nEffective tax rate.\nOur operations are in countries with different tax rates\nand fiscal structures.\nAccordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment,\nour overall\neffective tax rate can vary significantly between periods\nbased on the mix\u201d of before-tax earnings\nwithin our global operations.\n\u25cf\nFiscal and regulatory environment.\nOur operations can be affected by changing economic,\nregulatory\nand political environments in the various countries\nin which we operate, including the U.S.\nCivil\nunrest or strained relationships with governments\nmay impact our operations or investments.\nThese\nchanging environments could negatively impact our\nresults of operations, and further changes to\nincrease government fiscal take could have a\nnegative impact on future operations.\nOur management\ncarefully considers the fiscal and regulatory\nenvironment when evaluating projects or\ndetermining the\nlevels and locations of our activity.\nOutlook\nProduction and Capital\nIn February 2021, we announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of $5.5\nbillion.\nThe\nplan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for investment\nin major projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing\nexploration appraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nRestructuring\nAs a result of the acquisition of Concho, we commenced\na restructuring program in the first quarter\nof 2021 in\nassociation with combining the operations of the\ntwo companies.\nWe expect to incur significant non-recurring\ntransaction and acquisition-related costs in\n2021 for employee severance payments; incremental\npension\nbenefit costs related to the workforce reductions; employee\nretention costs; employee relocations; fees\npaid to\nfinancial, legal, and accounting advisors; and\nfiling fees.\nWe currently cannot estimate these costs, as well as\nother unanticipated items,\nand expect to recognize the majority\nof these expenses in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperating Segments\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily\ndefined by geographic region:\nAlaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East\nand North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs\nnot directly associated with an operating\nsegment, such as\nmost interest expense, premiums incurred on the\nearly retirement of debt, corporate overhead,\ncertain\ntechnology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical\ntables provided at the beginning of the operating\nsegment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity\nprices and production.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEffective with the third quarter of 2020, we have restructured our segments to align with\nchanges to our\ninternal organization.\nThe Middle East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific and Middle East\nsegment\nto the Europe and North Africa segment.\nThe segments have been renamed the Asia Pacific\nsegment and the\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nWe have revised segment information disclosures and\nsegment performance metrics presented within our results of operations for the\ncurrent and prior years.\nThis section of the Form 10-K\ndiscusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020\nand 2019.\nFor discussion of\nyear-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, see\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations\" in Exhibit\n99.1\n-\n, Item 7 filed with

ConocoPhillips\ndecreased $9.9 billion in 2020.\nThe decrease was mainly due\nto:\n\u25cf\nLower realized commodity prices.\n\u25cf\nLower sales volumes due to normal field decline,\nasset dispositions and production curtailments.\nFor\nadditional information related to dispositions,\nsee Note 4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated\nwith the completion of the sale of two\nConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nFor additional information, see Note 4-Asset\nAcquisitions and\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\u25cf\nAn unrealized loss of $855 million after-tax\non our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2020,\nas compared to a $649 million after-tax unrealized\ngain on those shares in 2019.\n\u25cf\nA $648 million after-tax impairment for the associated\ncarrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs and an equity method investment\nrelated to our Alaska North Slope Gas\nasset.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nIncreased impairments\nprimarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets which were\nwritten down to fair value due to lower commodity\nprices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u25cf\nThe absence of other income of $317 million after-tax\nrelated to our settlement agreement with\nPDVSA.\nThese decreases in net income (loss) were partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nLower production and operating expenses, primarily\ndue to the absence of costs related to our U.K.\nand Australia-West divestitures and decreased wellwork and transportation costs\nresulting from\nproduction curtailments across our North American\noperated assets.\n\u25cf\nA $597 million after-tax gain on dispositions related\nto our Australia-West divestiture.\n\u25cf\nLower DD&A expenses, primarily due to lower\nvolumes related to normal field decline and\nproduction curtailments as well as impacts\nof our Australia-West and U.K. divestitures.\nPartly\noffsetting this decrease, was higher DD&A expenses\ndue to price-related downward reserve revisions.\nIncome Statement Analysis\n2020 vs. 2019\nSales and other operating revenues decreased 42 percent\nin 2020, mainly due to lower realized commodity\nprices and lower sales volumes.\nSales volumes decreased due to normal field\ndecline, production curtailments\nfrom our North American operated assets and the\ndivestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and\nour Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates decreased $347 million\nin 2020, primarily due to lower earnings from\nQG3 and\nAPLNG because of lower LNG prices.\nPartly offsetting this decrease was the absence\nof impairments related\nto equity method investments in our Lower 48 segment\nof $155 million and the absence of a $118 million\ndeferred tax adjustment at QG3, reported in our\nEurope, Middle East and North Africa segment.\nGain on dispositions decreased $1.4 billion in\n2020, primarily due to the absence of a $1.7 billion\nbefore-tax\ngain associated with the completion of the sale\nof two ConocoPhillips U.K. subsidiaries.\nPartly offsetting the\ndecrease was a $587 million before-tax gain associated\nwith our Australia-West divestiture.\nFor more\ninformation related to these dispositions, see Note\n4-Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nin the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income (loss) decreased $1.9 billion\nin 2020, primarily due to a before-tax unrealized\nloss of $855\nmillion on our CVE common shares in 2020, and\nthe absence of a $649 million before-tax unrealized\ngain on\nthose shares in 2019.\nAdditionally, other income (loss) decreased due to the absence of $325 million\nbefore-\ntax related to our settlement agreement with PDVSA.\nFor discussion of our CVE shares, see Note 6-Investment\nin Cenovus Energy in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nFor discussion of our PDVSA settlement,\nsee Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nPurchased commodities decreased 32 percent in\n2020, primarily due to lower natural gas\nand crude oil prices;\nlower crude oil and natural gas volumes purchased;\nand the divestiture of our U.K. assets in the\nthird quarter of\n2019 and our Australia-West assets in the second quarter of 2020.\nProduction and operating expenses decreased $978\nmillion in 2020, primarily due to reduced activities\nand\ntransportation costs associated with lower activity\nacross our North American operated assets in\nresponse to\nthe low commodity price environment and the\nabsence of costs related to our U.K. and Australia-West\ndivestitures.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased\n$126 million in 2020, primarily due to lower\ncosts\nassociated with compensation and benefits,\nincluding mark to market impacts of certain\nkey employee\ncompensation programs.\nExploration expenses increased $714 million\nin 2020, primarily due to an $828 million before-tax\nimpairment\nfor the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped\nleasehold costs related to our Alaska\nNorth Slope Gas\nasset.\nPartly offsetting this increase, was the absence of\na $141 million before-tax leasehold impairment\nexpense due to our decision to discontinue exploration\nactivities in the Central Louisiana Austin\nChalk trend.\nFor additional information, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairments increased $408 million in\n2020, primarily related to developed properties\nin our non-core assets\nwhich were written down to fair value due to lower\ncommodity prices and development plan changes.\nFor\nadditional information, see Note 8-Impairments\nand Note 14-Fair Value Measurement in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nTaxes other than income taxes decreased $199 million in 2020, primarily due\nto lower commodity prices and\nvolumes.\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased\n$138 million in 2020, due to gains recognized\nfrom\nforeign currency derivatives and other foreign\ncurrency remeasurements.\nFor additional information, see Note\n13-Derivative and Financial Instruments\nin the

2019,\nprimarily due to:\n\u25cf\nNormal field decline.\n\u25cf\nThe divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third\nquarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the\nsecond quarter of 2020.\n\u25cf\nProduction curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED,\nprimarily from North American operated\nassets and Malaysia, in response to the low crude\noil price environment.\n\u25cf\nLess production in Libya due to the forced shutdown\nof the Es Sider export terminal and other\neastern\nexport terminals after a period of civil unrest.\nThe decrease in production during 2020 was partly\noffset by:\n\u25cf\nNew wells online in the Lower 48, Canada,\nNorway, Alaska and China.\nProduction excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments\nof\napproximately 80 MBOED and closed acquisitions\nand dispositions, production for 2020 would\nhave been\n1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 MBOED compared\nwith 2019.\nThis decrease was primarily due to normal\nfield decline, partly offset by new wells online in the\nLower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska and China.\nProduction from Libya averaged 9 MBOED as it\nwas in force majeure during

capital*\n%\nPercent of floating-rate debt to total debt\n%\n*Capital includes total debt and total equity.\nTo meet our short-\nand long-term liquidity requirements, we look\nto a variety of funding sources, including\ncash generated from operating activities,\nproceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper\nand credit facility\nprograms and our ability to sell securities\nusing our shelf registration statement.\nIn 2020, the primary uses of\nour available cash were $4,715 million to support\nour ongoing capital expenditures and investments\nprogram;\n$1,831 million to pay dividends on our common\nstock; $892 million to repurchase our common\nstock; and\n$658 million for net purchase of investments.\nDuring 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased\nby $2,097\nmillion to $2,991 million.\nWe entered the year with a strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents\nof over $5 billion, short-\nterm investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn\ncredit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately\n$14 billion\nin available liquidity.\nThis strong foundation allowed us to be measured\nin our response to the sudden change\nin business environment as we exited the first\nquarter of 2020.\nIn response to the oil market downturn\nthat\nbegan in early 2020,\nwe announced the following capital, share repurchase\nand operating cost reductions. We\nreduced our 2020 operating plan capital expenditures\nby a total of $2.3 billion, or approximately\nthirty-five\npercent of the original guidance.\nWe suspended our share repurchase program, further reducing cash outlays\nby approximately $2 billion.\nWe also reduced our operating costs by approximately $0.6 billion,\nor roughly\nten percent of the original 2020 guidance.\nCollectively, these actions represent a reduction in 2020 cash uses of\napproximately $5 billion versus the original operating\nplan.\nConsidering the weakness in oil prices during the\nsecond quarter of 2020, we established a framework\nfor\nevaluating and implementing economic curtailments,\nwhich resulted in taking an additional significant\nstep of\ncurtailing production, predominantly from\noperated North American assets.\nDue to our strong balance sheet,\nwe were in an advantaged position to forgo some production\nand cash flow in anticipation of receiving higher\ncash flows for those volumes in the future.\nBased on our economic criteria, we began\nrestoring production\nfrom voluntary curtailments in July, and with oil prices stabilizing around $40 per\nbarrel, we ended our\ncurtailment program by the end of the third quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed\nshare repurchases, repurchasing $0.2 billion\nof shares in October,\nbefore suspending our share repurchase program\nupon entry into a definitive agreement to\nacquire Concho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after completion of our Concho\nacquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2020,\nwe had cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion,\nshort-term investments of $3.6\nbillion, and available borrowing capacity under\nour credit facility of $5.7 billion, totaling\nover $12 billion of\nliquidity.\nWe believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external\nsources of funds as described below in the Significant\nChanges in Capital\u201d section, will be sufficient\nto meet\nour funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including\nour capital spending program, dividend\npayments and required debt payments.\nSignificant Changes in Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2020, cash provided by operating activities\nwas $4,802 million, a 57 percent decrease from 2019.\nThe\ndecrease was primarily due to lower realized\ncommodity prices, normal field decline,\nproduction curtailments,\nthe divestiture of our U.K.\nand Australia-West assets, and the absence in 2020 of collections under our\nsettlement agreement with PDVSA,\npartially offset by lower production and operating\nexpenses.\nOur short-\nand long-term operating cash flows are highly\ndependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural\ngas, LNG and NGLs.\nPrices and margins in our industry have historically\nbeen volatile and are driven by\nmarket conditions over which we have no control.\nAbsent other mitigating factors, as these\nprices and margins\nfluctuate, we would expect a corresponding\nchange in our operating cash flows.\nThe level of absolute production volumes, as\nwell as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.\nFull-\nyear production averaged 1,127 MBOED in 2020.\nFull-year production excluding Libya averaged\n1,118\nMBOED in 2020.\nAdjusting for estimated curtailments of approximately\n80 MBOED;\nclosed acquisitions and\ndispositions;\nand excluding Libya; production for 2020 was 1,176 MBOED.\nProduction in 2021 is expected to\nbe approximately 1.5 MMBOED, reflecting the\nimpact from the Concho acquisition.\nFuture production is\nsubject to numerous uncertainties, including,\namong others, the volatile crude oil and\nnatural gas price\nenvironment, which may impact investment decisions;\nthe effects of price changes on production sharing\nand\nvariable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition\nof fields; field production decline rates; new\ntechnologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups\nand major turnarounds; political instability;\nweather-\nrelated disruptions; and the addition of proved\nreserves through exploratory success and\ntheir timely and cost-\neffective development.\nWhile we actively manage these factors,\nproduction levels can cause variability in cash\nflows, although generally this variability\nhas not been as significant as that caused by commodity\nprices.\nTo maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue\nto add to our proved\nreserve base.\nOur proved reserves generally increase as prices\nrise and decrease as prices decline.\nReserve\nreplacement represents the net change in proved\nreserves, net of production, divided by our current\nyear\nproduction, as shown in our supplemental reserve table\ndisclosures.\nOur reserve replacement was negative 86\npercent in 2020, reflecting the impact of lower\nprices, which reduced reserves by approximately\n600 MMBOE.\nOur organic reserve replacement, which excluded a net\ndecrease of 7 MMBOE from sales and purchases,\nwas\nnegative 84 percent in 2020.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2020, our reserve\nreplacement was 59 percent, reflecting the impact\nof\nlower prices in 2020.\nOur organic reserve replacement during the three years\nended December 31, 2020,\nwhich excluded a net increase of 89 MMBOE related\nto sales and purchases, was 53 percent.\nFor additional information about our 2021 capital\nbudget, see the 2021 Capital Budget\u201d section\nwithin\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\u201d and for additional\ninformation on proved reserves, including both\ndeveloped and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil\nand Gas Operations\u201d section of this report.\nAs discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d\nsection, engineering estimates of proved\nreserves are\nimprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised\nupward or downward due to the impact of changes\nin\ncommodity prices or as more technical data becomes\navailable on reservoirs.\nIt is not possible to reliably\npredict how revisions will impact reserve quantities\nin the future.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2020, we invested $4.7 billion in capital\nexpenditures, of which $0.5 billion consisted of\nstrategic\nacquisitions, including additional Montney acreage.\nCapital expenditures invested in 2019 and 2018\nwere $6.6\nbillion and $6.8 billion,\nrespectively.\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\u201d\nsection.\nWe invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is\nto protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide\nyield and total returns;\nthese investments include time\ndeposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities\nclassified as available for sale.\nFunds for short-term\nneeds to support our operating plan and provide resiliency\nto react to short-term price volatility are invested\nin\nhighly liquid instruments with maturities within\nthe year.\nFunds we consider available to maintain resiliency\nin longer term price downturns and to capture\nopportunities outside a given operating\nplan may be invested in\ninstruments with maturities greater than one year.\nFor additional information, see Note 1-Accounting\nPolicies\nand Note 13-Derivative and Financial Instruments,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nInvesting activities in 2020 included net purchases\nof $658 million of investments,\nof which $420 million was\ninvested in short-term instruments and $238 million\nwas invested in long-term instruments.\nInvesting\nactivities in 2019 included net purchases of $2.9\nbillion of investments,\nof which $2.8 billion was invested in\nshort-term instruments and $0.1 billion was invested\nin long-term instruments.\nFor additional information, see\nNote 13-Derivative and Financial Instruments,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nProceeds from asset sales in 2020 were $1.3 billion.\nWe received cash proceeds of $765 million for the\ndivestiture of our Australia-West assets and operations,\nwith another $200 million payment due upon final\ninvestment decision of the proposed Barossa\ndevelopment project.\nWe also received proceeds of $359 million\nand $184 million for the sale of our Niobrara interests\nand Waddell Ranch interests in the Lower 48,\nrespectively.\nProceeds from asset sales in 2019 were $3.0 billion,\nincluding $2.2 billion for the sale of\ntwo ConocoPhillips\nU.K. subsidiaries and $350 million for\nthe sale of our 30 percent interest in the Greater\nSunrise Fields.\nProceeds from assets sales in 2018 were $1.1\nbillion, including several non-core assets in\nthe Lower 48, as\nwell as the sale of a ConocoPhillips subsidiary\nwhich held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest\nin the Clair\nField in the U.K.\nFor additional information on our dispositions,\nsee Note 4-Asset Acquisitions and\nDispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nFinancing Activities\nWe have a revolving credit facility totaling $6.0 billion, expiring in May 2023.\nOur revolving credit facility\nmay be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance\nof letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as\nsupport for our commercial paper program.\nThe revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated\namong financial\ninstitutions and does not contain any material\nadverse change provisions or any covenants\nrequiring\nmaintenance of specified financial ratios or credit\nratings.\nThe facility agreement contains a cross-default\nprovision relating to the failure to pay principal or\ninterest on other debt obligations of\n$200 million or more\nby ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe amount of the facility is not subject to\nthe\nredetermination prior to its expiration date.\nCredit facility borrowings may bear interest at\na margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the\nLondon interbank market or at a margin above the overnight\nfederal funds rate or prime rates offered by\ncertain designated banks in the U.S.\nThe agreement calls for commitment fees\non available, but unused,\namounts.\nThe agreement also contains early termination\nrights if our current directors or their approved\nsuccessors cease to be a majority of the Board\nof Directors.\nThe revolving credit facility supports the ConocoPhillips\nCompany's ability to issue up to $6.0 billion of\ncommercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term\nworking capital needs.\nCommercial\npaper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.\nWith $300 million of commercial paper outstanding and no\ndirect borrowings or letters of credit,\nwe had $5.7 billion in available borrowing capacity\nunder the revolving\ncredit facility at December 31, 2020.\nWe may consider issuing additional commercial paper in the future to\nsupplement our cash position.\nIn October 2020, Moody's affirmed its rating of our senior long-term debt of A3\u201d\nwith a stable\u201d outlook, and\naffirmed its rating of our short-term debt as Prime-2.\u201d\nIn January 2021, Fitch affirmed its rating of our long-\nterm debt as A\u201d with a stable\u201d outlook and affirmed its\nrating of our short-term debt as +.\u201d\nOn January\n25, 2021, S&P revised the industry risk assessment\nfor the E&P industry to \u2018Moderately High' from\n\u2018Intermediate' based on a view of increasing\nrisks from the energy transition, price volatility, and weaker\nprofitability.\nOn February 11, 2021, S&P downgraded its rating of our long-term debt\nfrom A\u201d to A-\u201d with a\nstable\u201d outlook and downgraded its rating of our short-term\ndebt from A-1\u201d to A-2.\u201d\nWe do not have any\nratings triggers on any of our corporate debt\nthat would cause an automatic default, and\nthereby impact our\naccess to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings.\nIf our credit ratings\nare downgraded from their\ncurrent levels, it could increase the cost of corporate\ndebt available to us and restrict our access to\nthe\ncommercial paper markets.\nIf our credit rating were to deteriorate\nto a level prohibiting us from accessing the\ncommercial paper market, we would still\nbe able to access funds under our revolving credit\nfacility.\nCertain of our project-related contracts, commercial\ncontracts and derivative instruments contain\nprovisions\nrequiring us to post collateral.\nMany of these contracts and instruments permit\nus to post either cash or letters\nof credit as collateral.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had direct\nbank letters of credit of $249 million\nand $277 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to\nvarious purchase\ncommitments incident to the ordinary conduct of\nbusiness.\nIn the event of credit\nratings downgrades, we may\nbe required to post additional letters of\ncredit.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Concho in an all-stock transaction. In the acquisition,\nwe assumed Concho's publicly traded debt.\nOn December 7, 2020, we launched an offer to exchange\nConcho's publicly traded debt for debt issued by ConocoPhillips.\nThe exchange offer settled on February 8,\n2021.\nOf the approximately $3.9 billion in aggregate\nprincipal amount of Concho's notes subject to the\nexchange offer, 98 percent, or approximately $3.8 billion, was tendered and\nexchanged for new debt issued by\nConocoPhillips.\nThere were no impacts to ConocoPhillips'\ncredit ratings as a result of the debt exchange.\nFor\nadditional information,\nsee Note 10-Debt and Note 25-Acquisition\nof Concho Resources Inc., in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShelf Registration\nWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which\nwe have the ability to issue\nand sell an indeterminate amount of various types\nof debt and equity securities.\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nWe have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company\nand Burlington Resources\nLLC, with respect to publicly held debt securities.\nConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent\nowned by\nConocoPhillips.\nBurlington Resources LLC is 100 percent\nowned by ConocoPhillips Company.\nConocoPhillips and/or ConocoPhillips Company\nhave fully and unconditionally guaranteed\nthe payment\nobligations of Burlington Resources LLC, with respect\nto its publicly held debt securities.\nSimilarly,\nConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally\nguaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips\nCompany\nwith respect to its publicly held debt securities.\nIn addition, ConocoPhillips Company\nhas fully and\nunconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations\nof ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly\nheld debt\nsecurities.\nAll guarantees are joint and several.\nIn March of 2020, the SEC adopted amendments\nto simplify the financial disclosure requirements\nfor\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nregistered under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X.\nBased on our\nevaluation of our existing guarantee relationships,\nwe qualify for the transition to alternative disclosures.\nWe\nelected early voluntary compliance with the final\namendments beginning in the third quarter\nof 2020.\nAccordingly, condensed consolidating information by guarantor and issuer of\nguaranteed securities will no\nlonger be reported, and alternative disclosures\nof summarized financial information for the\nconsolidated\nObligor Group is presented.\nThe following tables present summarized financial\ninformation for the Obligor\nGroup, as defined below:\n\u25cf\nThe Obligor Group will reflect guarantors and issuers\nof guaranteed securities consisting of\nConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company and\nBurlington Resources LLC.\n\u25cf\nConsolidating adjustments for elimination\nof investments in and transactions between the collective\nguarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities\nare reflected in the balances of the summarized\nfinancial information.\n\u25cf\nNon-Obligated Subsidiaries are excluded\nfrom this presentation.\nTransactions and balances reflecting activity between the Obligors\nand Non-Obligated Subsidiaries are\npresented separately below:\nSummarized Income Statement Data\nMillions of Dollars\nRevenues and Other Income\n$\n8,375\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(2,999)\nNet income (loss)\n(2,701)\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to ConocoPhillips\n(2,701)\nSummarized Balance Sheet Data\nMillions of Dollars\nDecember 31, 2020\nCurrent assets\n$\n8,535\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\nNoncurrent assets\n37,180\nAmounts due from Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n7,730\nCurrent liabilities\n3,797\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, current\n1,365\nNoncurrent liabilities\n18,627\nAmounts due to Non-Obligated Subsidiaries, noncurrent\n3,972\nCapital Requirements\nFor information about our capital expenditures\nand investments, see the Capital Expenditures\nand\nInvestments\u201d\nsection.\nOur debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15,369\nmillion, an increase of $474 million from\nthe balance at\nDecember 31, 2019.\nMaturities of debt (including payments for\nfinance leases) due in 2021 of $601 million,\nexcluding net unamortized premiums and discounts,\nwill be paid from current cash balances and cash\ngenerated by operations.\nFor more information on Debt, see Note 10-Debt,\nin the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe believe in delivering value to our shareholders via a growing and sustainable dividend\nsupplemented by\nadditional returns of capital, including share repurchases.\nIn 2020, we paid $1,831 million, $1.69 per share of\ncommon stock, in dividends. This is an increase\nover 2019 and 2018, when we paid $1.34 and\n$1.16 per share\nof common stock, respectively.\nIn February 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend\nof $0.43 per share,\npayable March 1, 2021, to stockholders of record\nat the close of business on February 12, 2021.\nIn late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase\nprogram, which has a current total program\nauthorization of $25 billion of our common stock.\nCost of share repurchases were $892 million,\n$3,500\nmillion and $2,999 million in 2020, 2019 and\n2018,\nrespectively.\nShare repurchases since inception of our\ncurrent program totaled 189\nmillion shares at a cost of $10,517 million, as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nIn the\nfourth quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchases\nupon entry into a definitive agreement\nto acquire\nConcho.\nWe resumed share repurchases in February 2021 after the completion of our Concho acquisition.\nRepurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices,\nsubject to market conditions and other\nfactors.\nOur dividend and share repurchase programs are\nsubject to numerous considerations, including\nmarket\nconditions, management discretion and other factors.\nSee Item 1A - Risk Factors\n-\nOur ability to declare and\npay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to\ncertain considerations.\u201d\nIn addition to the requirements above, we have contractual\nobligations for the purchase of goods and services\nof approximately $8,123 million.\nWe expect to fulfill $2,805 million of these obligations in 2021. These\nfigures exclude purchase commitments\nfor jointly owned fields and facilities where\nwe are not the operator.\nPurchase obligations of $5,237 million\nare related to agreements to access and utilize\nthe capacity of third-\nparty equipment and facilities, including pipelines\nand LNG product terminals, to transport, process,\ntreat and\nstore commodities.\nPurchase obligations of $2,290

announced 2021 operating\nplan capital for the combined company of $5.5\nbillion.\nThe\nplan includes $5.1 billion to sustain current\nproduction and $0.4 billion for investment\nin major projects,\nprimarily in Alaska, in addition to ongoing exploration\nappraisal activity.\nThe operating plan capital budget of $5.5 billion\nis expected to deliver production from the combined\ncompany\nof approximately 1.5 MMBOED in 2021.\nThis production guidance excludes Libya.\nFor information on PUDs and the associated costs\nto develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas\nOperations\u201d\nsection in this report.\nContingencies\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims\narising in the ordinary course of business\nhave been filed\nagainst ConocoPhillips.\nWe also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the\nplacement, storage, disposal or release of certain\nchemical, mineral and petroleum substances\nat various active\nand inactive sites.\nWe regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these\ncontingencies.\nIn the case of all known contingencies (other\nthan those related to income taxes), we accrue\na\nliability when the loss is probable and the amount\nis reasonably estimable.\nIf a range of amounts can be\nreasonably estimated and no amount within the range\nis a better estimate than any other amount,\nthen the low\nend of the range is accrued.\nWe do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.\nWe accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable.\nWith respect to income\ntax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted\nloss accrual in cases where sustaining a\ntax position is less than certain.\nBased on currently available information, we believe\nit is remote that future costs related to known\ncontingent\nliability exposures will exceed current accruals by\nan amount that would have a material\nadverse impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nFor information on other contingencies, see\nCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies and\nCommitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters\ninvolving oil and gas royalty\nand severance tax payments, gas measurement and\nvaluation methods, contract disputes,\nenvironmental\ndamages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.\nOur primary exposures for such matters\nrelate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments\non certain federal, state and privately owned\nproperties and\nclaims of alleged environmental contamination\nfrom historic operations.\nWe will continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience\nand professional judgment to the specific\ncharacteristics of our cases, employing a litigation\nmanagement process to manage and monitor the\nlegal\nproceedings against us.\nOur process facilitates the early evaluation and\nquantification of potential exposures in\nindividual cases.\nThis process also enables us to track those cases that\nhave been scheduled for trial and/or\nmediation.\nBased on professional judgment and experience\nin using these litigation management tools and\navailable information about current developments\nin all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses\nthe\nadequacy of current accruals and determines if\nadjustment of existing accruals, or establishment\nof new\naccruals, is required.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor\nadditional information about income tax-related\ncontingencies.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental\nlaws and

regulations,\nwhich relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S.\nwaters and impose liability for the cost of pollution\ncleanup resulting from operations, as well as\npotential liability for pollution damages.\n\u25cf\nEuropean Union Trading Directive resulting in European\nEmissions Trading Scheme.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations\nset limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to\nwater,\nestablish water quality limits and establish standards\nand impose obligations for the remediation\nof releases of\nhazardous substances and hazardous wastes.\nThey also, in most cases, require permits in\nassociation with new\nor modified operations.\nThese permits can require an applicant to\ncollect substantial information in connection\nwith the application process, which can be expensive\nand time consuming.\nIn addition, there can be delays\nassociated with notice and comment periods and\nthe agency's processing of the application.\nMany of the\ndelays associated with the permitting process\nare beyond the control of the applicant.\nMany states and foreign countries where\nwe operate also have, or are developing, similar\nenvironmental laws\nand regulations governing these same types of\nactivities.\nWhile similar, in some cases these regulations may\nimpose additional, or more stringent, requirements\nthat can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing\nor\ntransporting products across state and international\nborders.\nThe ultimate financial impact arising from\nenvironmental laws and regulations is neither\nclearly known nor\neasily determinable as new standards, such as\nair emission standards and water quality standards,\ncontinue to\nevolve.\nHowever, environmental laws and regulations, including those that\nmay arise to address concerns\nabout global climate change, are expected to continue\nto have an increasing impact on our operations\nin the\nU.S. and in other countries in which we operate.\nNotable areas of potential impacts include air emission\ncompliance and remediation obligations in\nthe U.S. and Canada.\nAn example is the use of hydraulic fracturing,\nan essential completion technique that facilitates\nproduction of\noil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower\npermeability rock formations.\nA range of local, state, federal or\nnational laws and regulations currently govern\nhydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic\nfracturing\ncurrently prohibited in some jurisdictions.\nAlthough hydraulic fracturing has been conducted\nfor many\ndecades, a number of new laws, regulations\nand permitting requirements are under consideration\nby various\nstate environmental agencies, and others which\ncould result in increased costs, operating restrictions,\noperational delays and/or limit the ability\nto develop oil and natural gas resources.\nGovernmental restrictions\non hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall\nprofitability or viability of certain of our oil\nand natural gas\ninvestments.\nWe have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards\ndesigned to\nmeet or exceed government requirements.\nOur practices continually evolve as technology\nimproves and\nregulations change.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation\nobligations\nassociated with current and past operations.\nSuch laws and regulations include CERCLA\nand RCRA and their\nstate equivalents.\nLonger-term expenditures are subject to considerable\nuncertainty and may fluctuate\nsignificantly.\nWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability\nfrom the EPA and state\nenvironmental agencies alleging we are a potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent\nstate\nstatute.\nOn occasion, we also have been made a party\nto cost recovery litigation by those agencies\nor by\nprivate parties.\nThese requests, notices and lawsuits assert\npotential liability for remediation costs at various\nsites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly\ncontain wastes attributable to our past operations.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, there were 15 sites around\nthe U.S. in which we were identified as\na potentially\nresponsible party under CERCLA and comparable\nstate laws.\nFor most Superfund sites, our potential liability\nwill be significantly less than the total site\nremediation costs\nbecause the percentage of waste attributable\nto us, versus that attributable to all other\npotentially responsible\nparties, is relatively low.\nAlthough liability of those potentially\nresponsible is generally joint and several for\nfederal sites and frequently so for state sites,\nother potentially responsible parties at sites\nwhere we are a party\ntypically have had the financial strength to\nmeet their obligations, and where they have\nnot, or where\npotentially responsible parties could not be located,\nour share of liability has not increased materially.\nMany of\nthe sites at which we are potentially responsible\nare still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies\nconcerned.\nPrior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible\nnormally assess site conditions, apportion\nresponsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.\nIn some instances, we may have no liability\nor attain\na settlement of liability.\nActual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties\nobtain EPA or equivalent state\nagency approval.\nThere are relatively few sites where we\nare a major participant, and given the timing\nand\namounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the\ncost of remediation at those sites nor\nsuch costs at all\nCERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to\nhave a material adverse effect on our competitive\nor financial\ncondition.\nExpensed environmental costs were $393 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about $435 million\nper year\nin 2021 and 2022.\nCapitalized environmental costs were $161 million\nin 2020 and are expected to be about\n$210 million per year in 2021 and 2022.\nAccrued liabilities for remediation activities\nare not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers\nor other\nthird parties and are not discounted (except those\nassumed in a purchase business combination,\nwhich we do\nrecord on a discounted basis).\nMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA,\nRCRA and similar state or international laws that\nrequire us to\nundertake certain investigative and remedial\nactivities at sites where we conduct, or once\nconducted,\noperations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated\nwaste was disposed.\nThe accrual also includes a number\nof sites we identified that may require environmental\nremediation, but which are not currently the\nsubject of\nCERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement\nactivities.\nThe laws that require or address environmental\nremediation may apply retroactively and regardless\nof fault, the legality of the original activities\nor the current\nownership or control of sites.\nIf applicable, we accrue receivables for probable\ninsurance or other third-party\nrecoveries.\nIn the future, we may incur significant costs\nunder both CERCLA and RCRA.\nRemediation activities vary substantially\nin duration and cost from site to site, depending on the\nmix of unique\nsite characteristics, evolving remediation technologies,\ndiverse regulatory agencies and enforcement\npolicies,\nand the presence or absence of potentially liable\nthird parties.\nTherefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable\nestimates of future site remediation costs.\nAt December 31, 2020, our balance sheet included\ntotal accrued environmental costs of\n$180 million,\ncompared with $171 million at December 31,\n2019, for remediation activities in the\nU.S. and Canada.\nWe\nexpect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures\nwithin the next 30 years.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as\nwith other companies engaged in similar businesses,\nenvironmental costs and liabilities are inherent\nconcerns in our operations and products, and there\ncan be no\nassurance that material costs and liabilities\nwill not be incurred.\nHowever, we currently do not expect any\nmaterial adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial\nposition as a result of compliance with\ncurrent environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nContinuing political and social attention to the\nissue of global climate change has resulted in a broad\nrange of\nproposed or promulgated state, national and international\nlaws focusing on GHG reduction.\nThese proposed or\npromulgated laws apply or could apply in countries\nwhere we have interests or may have interests\nin the future.\nLaws in this field continue to evolve, and\nwhile it is not possible to accurately estimate either\na timetable for\nimplementation or our future compliance costs\nrelating to implementation, such laws, if\nenacted, could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nExamples of legislation and precursors\nfor possible regulation that do or could affect our operations\ninclude:\n\u25cf\nEuropean Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through\nwhich many of the EU member\nstates are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.\nOur cost of compliance with the EU ETS in\n2020 was\napproximately $7 million before-tax.\n\u25cf\nThe Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation\nrequires any existing\nfacility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000\nmetric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent,\nper year to meet a facility benchmark intensity.\nThe total cost of these regulations in 2020\nwas\napproximately $2 million.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts\nv. EPA\n,\n549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007),\nconfirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant\u201d\nunder the\nFederal Clean Air Act.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on March 29, 2010 (published\nas Interpretation of Regulations that\nDetermine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act\nPermitting Programs,\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April\n2,\n2010)), and the EPA's\nand U.S. Department of Transportation's joint promulgation of a Final Rule on\nApril 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs\nunder the Clean Air Act, may trigger more\nclimate-\nbased claims for damages, and may result in longer\nagency review time for development projects.\n\u25cf\nThe U.S. EPA's\nannouncement on January 14, 2015, outlining\na series of steps it plans to take to\naddress methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound\nemissions from the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe U.S. government established a goal of\nreducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions\nfrom the oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 percent\nby 2025.\n\u25cf\nCarbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.\nOur cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon\ntax legislation\nin 2020 was approximately $29 million (net\nshare before-tax).\nWe also incur a carbon tax for\nemissions from fossil fuel combustion in our\nBritish Columbia and Alberta operations in\nCanada,\ntotaling approximately $3.5 million (net share\nbefore-tax).\n\u25cf\nThe agreement reached in Paris in December 2015\nat the 21\nst\nConference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, setting out a process for achieving\nglobal\nemission reductions.\nThe new administration has recommitted\nthe United States to the Paris\nAgreement, and a significant number of U.S. state\nand local governments and major corporations\nheadquartered in the U.S. have also announced\nrelated commitments.\nIn the U.S., some additional form of regulation\nmay be forthcoming in the future at the\nfederal and state levels\nwith respect to GHG emissions.\nSuch regulation could take any of several\nforms that may result in the creation\nof additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction\nof output, investments of capital to maintain\ncompliance\nwith laws and regulations, or required acquisition\nor trading of emission allowances.\nWe are working to\ncontinuously improve operational and energy efficiency through\nresource and energy conservation throughout\nour operations.\nCompliance with changes in laws and regulations\nthat create a GHG tax, emission trading scheme\nor GHG\nreduction policies could significantly increase\nour costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived\nproducts,\nimpact the cost and availability of capital\nand increase our exposure to litigation.\nSuch laws and regulations\ncould also increase demand for less carbon intensive\nenergy sources, including natural gas.\nThe ultimate\nimpact on our financial performance, either positive\nor negative, will depend on a number of factors,\nincluding\nbut not limited to:\n\u25cf\nWhether and to what extent legislation or\nregulation is enacted.\n\u25cf\nThe timing of the introduction of such legislation\nor regulation.\n\u25cf\nThe nature of the legislation (such as a cap and\ntrade system or a tax on emissions) or\nregulation.\n\u25cf\nThe price placed on GHG emissions (either\nby the market or through a tax).\n\u25cf\nThe GHG reductions required.\n\u25cf\nThe price and availability of offsets.\n\u25cf\nThe amount and allocation of allowances.\n\u25cf\nTechnological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.\n\u25cf\nAny potential significant physical effects of climate\nchange (such as increased severe weather events,\nchanges in sea levels and changes in temperature).\n\u25cf\nWhether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are\nultimately reflected in the prices of\nour products and services.\nClimate Change Litigation\nBeginning in 2017, governmental and other entities\nin several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits\nagainst oil\nand gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages and equitable\nrelief to abate\nalleged climate change impacts.\nAdditional lawsuits with similar allegations\nare expected to be filed.\nThe\namounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal\nand factual issues involved in these cases are\nunprecedented.\nConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are\nfactually and legally meritless and are an\ninappropriate vehicle to address the challenges\nassociated with climate change and will\nvigorously defend\nagainst such lawsuits.\nSeveral Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana\nhave filed 43 lawsuits under Louisiana's State and Local\nCoastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA)\nagainst oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips,\nseeking compensatory damages for contamination\nand erosion of the Louisiana coastline\nallegedly caused by\nhistorical oil and gas operations.\nConocoPhillips entities are defendants\nin 22 of the lawsuits and will\nvigorously defend against them.\nBecause Plaintiffs' SLCRMA theories are unprecedented,\nthere is uncertainty\nabout these claims (both as to scope and damages)\nand any potential financial impact on the company.\nCompany Response to Climate-Related Risks\nThe company has responded by putting in place\na Sustainable Development Risk Management Standard\ncovering the assessment and registering of significant\nand high sustainable development risks based\non their\nconsequence and likelihood of occurrence.\nWe have developed a company-wide Climate Change Action Plan\nwith the goal of tracking mitigation activities\nfor each climate-related risk included in the corporate\nSustainable Development Risk Register.\nThe risks addressed in our Climate Change Action\nPlan fall into four broad categories:\n\u25cf\nGHG-related legislation and regulation.\n\u25cf\nGHG emissions management.\n\u25cf\nPhysical climate-related impacts.\n\u25cf\nClimate-related disclosure and reporting.\nEmissions are categorized into three different scopes.\nGross operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions\nhelp us understand our climate transition\nrisk.\n\u25cf\nScope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions\nfrom sources that we own or control.\n\u25cf\nScope 2 emissions are GHG emissions from\nthe generation of purchased electricity or\nsteam that we\nconsume.\nScope 3 emissions are indirect emissions\nfrom sources that we neither own nor control.\nWe announced in October 2020 the adoption of a Paris-aligned climate risk framework\nwith the objective of\nimplementing a coherent set of choices designed\nto facilitate the success of our existing exploration\nand\nproduction business through the energy transition.\nGiven the uncertainties remaining about how the\nenergy\ntransition will evolve, the strategy aims to be robust\nacross a range of potential future outcomes.\nThe strategy is comprised of four pillars:\n\u25cf\nTargets:\nOur target framework consists of a hierarchy of targets, from a long-term\nambition that sets\nthe direction and aim of the strategy, to a medium-term performance target for GHG emissions\nintensity, to shorter-term targets for flaring and methane intensity reductions. These\nperformance\ntargets are supported by lower-level internal business\nunit goals to enable the company to achieve the\ncompany-wide targets.\nWe have set a target to reduce our gross operated (scope 1 and 2) emissions\nintensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by\n2030, with an ambition to achieve net-zero\noperated\nemissions by 2050.\nWe have joined the World\nBank Flaring Initiative to work towards\nzero routine\nflaring of gas by 2030.\n\u25cf\nTechnology choices:\nWe expanded our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve process to provide a broader\nrange of opportunities for emission reduction\ntechnology.\n\u25cf\nPortfolio choices:\nOur corporate authorization process requires\nall qualifying projects to include a\nGHG price in their project approval economics.\nDifferent GHG prices are used depending on the\nregion or jurisdiction.\nProjects in jurisdictions with existing GHG\npricing regimes incorporate the\nexisting GHG price and forecast into their\neconomics.\nProjects where no existing GHG pricing\nregime exists utilize a scenario forecast from our\ninternally consistent World Energy Model.\nIn this\nway, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.\nThe\ncompany does not use an estimated market cost\nof GHG emissions when assessing reserves\nin\njurisdictions without existing GHG regulations.\n\u25cf\nExternal engagement: Our external engagement\naims to differentiate ConocoPhillips within the oil and\ngas sector with our approach to managing climate-related\nrisk.\nWe are a Founding Member of the\nClimate Leadership Council (CLC), an international\npolicy institute founded in collaboration\nwith\nbusiness and environmental interests to develop\na carbon dividend plan.\nParticipation in the CLC\nprovides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue\nabout carbon pricing and framing the issues\nin\nalignment with our public policy principles.\nWe also belong to and fund Americans For Carbon\nDividends, the education and advocacy branch of\nthe CLC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with GAAP requires management\nto select appropriate\naccounting policies and to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses.\nSee Note 1-Accounting Policies, in the Notes\nto Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for descriptions of our major accounting\npolicies.\nCertain of these accounting policies involve\njudgments and uncertainties to such an extent there\nis a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts\nwould have been reported under different conditions, or if\ndifferent assumptions had been used.\nThese critical\naccounting estimates are discussed with the Audit\nand Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at\nleast\nannually.\nWe believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along\nwith the discussion of\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowances in this\nreport, address all important accounting\nareas where the nature\nof accounting estimates or assumptions is material\ndue to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary\nto\naccount for highly uncertain matters or the\nsusceptibility of such matters to change.\nOil and Gas Accounting\nAccounting for oil and gas exploratory activity\nis subject to special accounting rules unique\nto the oil and gas\nindustry.\nThe acquisition of G&G seismic information,\nprior to the discovery of proved reserves, is\nexpensed\nas incurred, similar to accounting for research and\ndevelopment costs.\nHowever, leasehold acquisition costs\nand exploratory well costs are capitalized on the\nbalance sheet pending determination of whether\nproved oil\nand gas reserves have been recognized.\nProperty Acquisition Costs\nFor individually significant leaseholds, management\nperiodically assesses for impairment based on\nexploration\nand drilling efforts to date.\nFor relatively small individual leasehold acquisition\ncosts, management exercises\njudgment and determines a percentage probability\nthat the prospect ultimately will fail to find\nproved oil and\ngas reserves and pools that leasehold information\nwith others in the geographic area.\nFor prospects in areas\nwith limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling,\nthe percentage probability of ultimate failure\nis normally\njudged to be quite high.\nThis judgmental percentage is multiplied\nby the leasehold acquisition cost, and that\nproduct is divided by the contractual period\nof the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold\nimpairment\ncharge that is reported in exploration expense.\nThis judgmental probability percentage is reassessed\nand\nadjusted throughout the contractual period of the\nleasehold based on favorable or unfavorable\nexploratory\nactivity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds,\nand leasehold impairment amortization expense is\nadjusted\nprospectively.\nAt year-end 2020, the remaining $2.4 billion of net capitalized\nunproved property costs consisted primarily\nof\nindividually significant leaseholds, mineral rights\nheld in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory\nwells\ncurrently being drilled, suspended exploratory\nwells, and capitalized interest.\nOf this amount, approximately\n$1.9 billion is concentrated in 10 major development\nareas, the majority of which are not expected to\nmove to\nproved properties in 2021.\nManagement periodically assesses individually\nsignificant leaseholds for\nimpairment based on the results of exploration\nand drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.\nExploratory Costs\nFor exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily\ncapitalized, or suspended,\u201d on the balance sheet,\npending\na determination of whether potentially economic\noil and gas reserves have been discovered by the\ndrilling\neffort to justify development.\nIf exploratory wells encounter potentially economic\nquantities of oil and gas, the well costs\nremain capitalized\non the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing\nthe reserves and the economic and operating\nviability of the project is being made.\nThe accounting notion of sufficient progress\u201d is\na judgmental area, but\nthe accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization\nof suspended well costs on the expectation\nfuture\nmarket conditions will improve or new technologies\nwill be found that would make the development\neconomically profitable.\nOften, the ability to move into the development\nphase and record proved reserves is\ndependent on obtaining permits and government\nor co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is\nultimately\nbeyond our control.\nExploratory well costs remain suspended as long\nas we are actively pursuing such\napprovals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.\nOnce all required approvals and permits have\nbeen\nobtained, the projects are moved into the development\nphase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated\nas\nproved reserves.\nFor complex exploratory discoveries, it\nis not unusual to have exploratory wells remain\nsuspended on the balance sheet for several\nyears while we perform additional appraisal\ndrilling and seismic\nwork on the potential oil and gas field or while\nwe seek government or co-venturer approval of development\nplans or seek environmental permitting.\nOnce a determination is made the well did not\nencounter potentially\neconomic oil and gas quantities, the well costs\nare expensed as a dry hole and reported in\nexploration expense.\nManagement reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors\nthe results of the additional\nappraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses\nthe suspended well costs as a dry hole when it\ndetermines\nthe potential field does not warrant further\ninvestment in the near term.\nCriteria utilized in making this\ndetermination include evaluation of the reservoir\ncharacteristics and hydrocarbon properties,\nexpected\ndevelopment costs, ability to apply existing technology\nto produce the reserves, fiscal terms,\nregulations or\ncontract negotiations, and our expected return\non investment.\nAt year-end 2020,\ntotal suspended well costs were $682 million,\ncompared with $1,020 million at year-end\n2019.\nFor additional information on suspended wells,\nincluding an aging analysis, see Note 7-Suspended\nWells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nProved Reserves\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves\nare inherently imprecise and represent only\napproximate amounts because of the judgments involved\nin developing such information.\nReserve estimates\nare based on geological and engineering assessments\nof in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production\nplan,\nhistorical extraction recovery and processing yield\nfactors, installed plant operating capacity\nand approved\noperating limits.\nThe reliability of these estimates at any point\nin time depends on both the quality and\nquantity of the technical and economic data\nand the efficiency of extracting and processing the\nhydrocarbons.\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering\nestimates, accounting rules require disclosure\nof\nproved\u201d reserve estimates due to the importance\nof these estimates to better understand the perceived\nvalue\nand future cash flows of a company's operations.\nThere are several authoritative guidelines\nregarding the\nengineering criteria that must be met before estimated\nreserves can be designated as proved.\u201d\nOur\ngeosciences and reservoir engineering organization\nhas policies and procedures in place consistent\nwith these\nauthoritative guidelines.\nWe have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate\nour\nproved reserves held by consolidated companies, as\nwell as our share of equity affiliates.\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually\nin the fourth quarter and during the year\nif significant changes\noccur, and take into account recent production and subsurface\ninformation about each field.\nAlso, as required\nby current authoritative guidelines, the estimated\nfuture date when an asset will reach the end\nof its economic\nlife is based on 12-month average prices and current\ncosts.\nThis date estimates when production will end and\naffects the amount of estimated reserves.\nTherefore, as prices and cost levels change from\nyear to year, the\nestimate of proved reserves also changes.\nGenerally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and\nincrease as prices rise.\nOur proved reserves include estimated quantities\nrelated to PSCs, reported under the economic interest\u201d\nmethod, as well as variable-royalty regimes,\nand are subject to fluctuations in commodity\nprices; recoverable\noperating expenses; and capital costs.\nIf costs remain stable, reserve quantities\nattributable to recovery of costs\nwill change inversely to changes in commodity\nprices.\nWe would expect reserves from these contracts to\ndecrease when product prices rise and increase\nwhen prices decline.\nThe estimation of proved developed reserves also\nis important to the income statement because\nthe proved\ndeveloped reserve estimate for a field serves as the\ndenominator in the unit-of-production\ncalculation of the\nDD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset.\nAt year-end 2020, the net book value of productive PP&E\nsubject to a unit-of-production calculation was\napproximately $33 billion and the DD&A recorded\non these\nassets in 2020 was approximately $5.3 billion.\nThe estimated proved developed reserves for\nour consolidated\noperations were 3.2 billion BOE at the end\nof 2019 and 2.5 billion BOE at the end of\n2020.\nIf the estimates of\nproved reserves used in the unit-of-production\ncalculations had been lower by 10 percent\nacross all\ncalculations, before-tax DD&A in 2020\nwould have increased by an estimated $588\nmillion.\nImpairments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed\nfor impairment whenever changes in facts\nand circumstances\nindicate a possible significant deterioration\nin future cash flows expected to be generated\nby an asset group.\nIf\nthere is an indication the carrying amount of\nan asset may not be recovered, a recoverability\ntest is performed\nusing management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development\nplans.\nIf, upon review, the sum\nof the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes\nis less than the carrying value of the asset\ngroup, the\ncarrying value is written down to estimated fair\nvalue and reported as impairments in the\nperiods in which the\ndetermination is made.\nIndividual assets are grouped for impairment\npurposes at the lowest level for which\nthere are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent\nof the cash flows of other groups of assets-\ngenerally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets.\nBecause there usually is a lack of quoted\nmarket prices for\nlong-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets\nis typically determined based on the present\nvalues of\nexpected future cash flows using discount rates\nand prices believed to be consistent with\nthose used by\nprincipal market participants,\nor based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated\nwith historical market\ntransactions of similar assets where possible.\nThe expected future cash flows used for\nimpairment reviews and\nrelated fair value calculations are based on estimated\nfuture production volumes, commodity\nprices, operating\ncosts and capital decisions, considering all\navailable information at the date of review.\nDiffering assumptions\ncould affect the timing and the amount of an impairment\nin any period.\nSee Note 8-Impairments, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional information.\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities\naccounted for under the equity method are assessed\nfor impairment\nwhenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate\na loss in value has occurred.\nSuch evidence of a loss\nin value might include our inability to\nrecover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained\nearnings capacity\nwhich would justify the current investment amount,\nor a current fair value less than the investment's carrying\namount.\nWhen such a condition is judgmentally determined\nto be other than temporary, an impairment charge\nis recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated\nfair value.\nWhen\ndetermining whether a decline in value is other than\ntemporary, management considers factors such as the\nlength of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition\nand near-term prospects, and our\nability and intention to retain our investment for\na period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in the market value of the investment.\nSince quoted market prices are usually not\navailable, the fair\nvalue is typically based on the present value\nof expected future cash flows using discount\nrates and prices\nbelieved to be consistent with those used by principal\nmarket participants, plus market analysis\nof comparable\nassets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\nDiffering assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of\nan impairment of an investment in any period.\nSee the APLNG\u201d section of Note 5-Investments,\nLoans and\nLong-Term Receivables,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs\nUnder various contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have material legal obligations to remove\ntangible\nequipment and restore the land or seabed at the\nend of operations at operational sites.\nOur largest asset\nremoval obligations involve plugging and abandonment\nof wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and\ngas\nplatforms around the world, as well as oil and gas\nproduction facilities and pipelines in Alaska.\nThe fair values\nof obligations for dismantling and removing these\nfacilities are recorded as a liability and\nan increase to PP&E\nat the time of installation of the asset based on estimated\ndiscounted costs.\nFair value is estimated using a\npresent value approach, incorporating assumptions\nabout estimated amounts and timing of settlements\nand\nimpacts of the use of technologies.\nEstimating future asset removal costs requires\nsignificant judgement.\nMost\nof these removal obligations are many years, or decades,\nin the future and the contracts and regulations\noften\nhave vague descriptions of what removal practices\nand criteria must be met when the removal\nevent actually\noccurs.\nThe carrying value of our asset retirement\nobligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset\nremoval technologies and costs, regulatory and other\ncompliance considerations, expenditure timing,\nand other\ninputs into valuation of the obligation, including\ndiscount and inflation rates, which are all\nsubject to change\nbetween the time of initial recognition of the liability\nand future settlement of our obligation.\nNormally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement\nas increases or decreases\nto DD&A over the remaining life of the assets.\nHowever, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as\nwell as previously sold assets for which we\nretained the asset removal obligation, an increase\nin the asset\nremoval obligation can result in an immediate\ncharge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E\ndue to the\nincreased obligation would immediately be subject\nto impairment, due to the low fair value of these\nproperties.\nIn addition to asset removal obligations, under the\nabove or similar contracts, permits and regulations,\nwe have\ncertain environmental-related projects.\nThese are primarily related to remediation\nactivities required by\nCanada and various states\nwithin the U.S. at exploration and production sites.\nFuture environmental\nremediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are\nsubject to change due to such factors as the\nuncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown\ntime and extent of such remedial actions\nthat may be\nrequired, and the determination of our liability\nin proportion to that of other responsible parties.\nSee Note 9-\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental\nCosts, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, for additional information.\nProjected Benefit Obligations\nDetermination of the projected benefit obligations\nfor our defined benefit pension and postretirement\nplans are\nimportant to the recorded amounts for such obligations\non the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit\nexpense in the income statement.\nThe actuarial determination of projected benefit\nobligations and company\ncontribution requirements involves judgment about\nuncertain future events, including estimated\nretirement\ndates, salary levels at retirement, mortality\nrates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan\nassets, future\nhealth care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization\nof health care services by retirees.\nDue to the specialized\nnature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial\nfirms to assist in the determination of these\nprojected\nbenefit obligations and company contribution requirements.\nFor Employee Retirement Income Security Act-\ngoverned pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary\ncare on behalf of plan participants in the\ndetermination\nof the judgmental assumptions used in determining\nrequired company contributions into the\nplans.\nDue to\ndiffering objectives and requirements between financial\naccounting rules and the pension plan funding\nregulations promulgated by governmental agencies,\nthe actuarial methods and assumptions\nfor the two\npurposes differ in certain important respects.\nUltimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under\npension and postretirement benefit plans not\nfunded by plan assets or investment returns,\nbut the judgmental\nassumptions used in the actuarial calculations\nsignificantly affect periodic financial statements and funding\npatterns over time.\nProjected benefit obligations are particularly\nsensitive to the discount rate assumption.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase projected benefit obligations\nby\n$1,200 million.\nBenefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate\nand return on plan assets assumptions.\nA\n100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption\nwould increase annual benefit expense by\n$110 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return\non plan assets assumption would increase annual\nbenefit expense by $80 million.\nIn determining the discount rate, we use yields\non high-quality fixed income\ninvestments matched to the estimated benefit\ncash flows of our plans.\nWe are also exposed to the possibility\nthat lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension\nplans during the year could exceed the total of\nservice\nand interest components of annual pension expense\nand trigger accelerated recognition of a portion\nof\nunrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.\nThese benefit payments are based on decisions\nby plan\nparticipants and are therefore difficult to predict.\nIn the event there is a significant reduction in the\nexpected\nyears of future service of present employees or the\nelimination of the accrual of defined benefits\nfor some or all\nof their future services for a significant number\nof employees, we could recognize a curtailment\ngain or loss.\nSee Note 17-Employee Benefit Plans, in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\nfor additional\ninformation.\nContingencies\nA number of claims and lawsuits are made against\nthe company arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\nManagement exercises judgment related to accounting\nand disclosure of these claims which includes\nlosses,\ndamages, and underpayments associated with environmental\nremediation, tax, contracts, and other legal\ndisputes.\nAs we learn new facts concerning contingencies,\nwe reassess our position both with respect to\namounts recognized and disclosed considering changes\nto the probability of additional losses and potential\nexposure.\nHowever, actual losses can and do vary from estimates\nfor a variety of reasons including legal,\narbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement\ndiscussions; evaluation of scope of damages;\ninterpretation of regulatory or contractual terms;\nexpected timing of future actions; and proportion\nof liability\nshared with other responsible parties.\nEstimated future costs related to contingencies\nare subject to change as\nevents evolve and as additional information becomes\navailable during the administrative and litigation\nprocesses.\nFor additional information on contingent\nliabilities, see the Contingencies\u201d section\nwithin Capital\nResources and Liquidity\u201d and Note 12-Contingencies\nand Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide.\nWe record deferred tax assets and\nliabilities to account for the expected future tax\nconsequences of events that have been recognized\nin our\nfinancial statements and our tax returns.\nWe routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by\na valuation allowance if we deem it is more\nlikely than not that some portion, or all,\nof the deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized.\nIn assessing the need for adjustments\nto existing valuation allowances, we consider all\navailable positive and negative evidence. Positive\nevidence includes reversals of temporary\ndifferences,\nforecasts of future taxable income, assessment of\nfuture business assumptions and applicable\ntax planning\nstrategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative\nevidence includes losses in recent years\nas well as the\nforecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable\nperiod. In making our assessment regarding\nvaluation\nallowances, we weight the evidence based on\nobjectivity.\nNumerous judgments and assumptions are inherent\nin the determination of future taxable income, including\nfactors such as future operating conditions\nand the\nassessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal\nincome taxes (particularly as related to prevailing\noil and gas prices).\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that\ncould result from\nassessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions\nin countries where we operate.\nWe recognize a tax benefit\nfrom an uncertain tax position when it is more\nlikely than not that the position will be sustained\nupon\nexamination, based on the technical merits\nof the position.\nThese accruals for uncertain tax positions are\nsubject to a significant amount of judgment and\nare reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis\nin light of\nchanging facts and circumstances considering the\nprogress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings,\nchanges in\napplicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and\nlegislative guidance, or expiration of the\napplicable statute\nof limitations.\nSee Note 18-Income Taxes for additional information, in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial\nStatements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nFOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR\u201d\nPROVISIONS OF\nTHE PRIVATE\nSECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis report

10-K\nand any additional risks described in our other filings\nwith the SEC.", "item_7_tables": "", "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- ConocoPhillips is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company with operations in 15 countries. In 2020, the company was negatively impacted by lower oil prices and demand due to COVID-19. \n\n- Net income attributable to ConocoPhillips decreased from $7.2 billion in 2019 to a loss of $2.7 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower realized commodity prices and sales volumes. This was partially offset by lower production costs and DD&A expenses.\n\n- Total production decreased 16% to 1,127 MBOED in 2020, mainly due to asset sales, production curtailments, and normal field decline. Production excluding Libya was 1,118 MBOED.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $4.7 billion in 2020, compared to $6.6 billion in 2019. The expenditures supported key developments in the Lower 48, Canada, Norway, Alaska, and other regions. \n\n- In 2021, the capital budget is $5.5 billion which includes the impact of acquiring Concho Resources. This is expected to deliver production of approximately 1.5 MMBOED.\n\n- The company has adopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\n- At year-end 2020, ConocoPhillips had $3 billion in cash, $3.6 billion in short-term investments, and $5.7 billion in available credit facility, totaling over $12 billion in liquidity.\n\nIn summary, ConocoPhillips' financial performance was significantly impacted by the downturn in 2020, but the company took actions to cut costs and capital spending while maintaining liquidity, with a focus on generating free cash flow through the cycles."}
