Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds.\nOverview\nGeneral\n2021 marked a new chapter at Sculptor as we continued to execute on our business plan. We began this chapter with a strong foundation after focusing over the last few years on building business stability. The following accomplishments were key to evolving the business to where it stands today, with sustained investment performance, improved investor flows and a stronger balance sheet.\nFirst, we continued to deliver sustained investment performance across our funds for our clients over most measurable time horizons. Sculptor Master Fund was up 5.0% net for full year 2021 and Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund and Customized Credit Focused Platform were up 17.0% and 17.2% net, respectively, for the full year 2021.\nSecond, our funds have stabilized their asset base and we have seen progress in our flows. This began by normalizing redemption levels and then building the pipeline for flows. Gross inflows in the multi-strategy funds were 11.3% of beginning AUM for 2021. This improvement, coupled with normalized redemption rates, led to the first year of positive net flows into the multi-strategy funds since 2014. Increases in our asset base from flows and fund performance have driven the rise in our management fee earnings. We have also been able to evolve our product mix from shorter-duration to longer-duration products. Our longer-term AUM has increased to 68% in 2021 from 26% in 2013. As a result, our asset base has increased longevity, creating consistency in our management fees.\nThird, we have strengthened our balance sheet. We refinanced our liabilities at the end of 2020 and have since paid down $224 million of term debt this year, the lowest level of debt since our IPO in 2007\nGiven the above, we believe the fundamentals driving our earnings are sound and growing. Our management fees are up $31 million year-over-year. Our earnings, excluding the benefit of incentive income and the associated variable bonus expense, which includes management fees less fixed expenses (salaries and benefits, minimum discretionary bonus, and general, administrative, and other expenses) has gone from negative to positive over the last two years. This is a function of growing management fees while cutting or maintaining fixed expenses noted above.\nWhile the business fundamentals are sound, the earnings for any given year can have volatility due to annual performance or incentive fee recognition timing. Over time, we created greater consistency in management fees as our longer-term AUM grew. With that also comes volatility in overall earnings due to the impact of longer-term AUM on incentive fee recognition and associated variable bonus expense timing. There is a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue our discretionary bonus expense, which is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the full calendar year. Incentive income for this longer-term AUM is typically recognized near the end of a multi-year period, which can create year-over-year volatility in incentive income.\nGiven the above, when we evaluate our business, we look to the underlying earnings drivers of the organization which will drive future returns to shareholders. These key indicators include strong fund performance and incremental net flows compounding our asset base, continuing to be cognizant of our cost framework, and growing and utilizing our balance sheet to invest in the growth of the business.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we continued to focus on the health and well-being of our employees and the uninterrupted service to investors in our funds and our shareholders. Where appropriate or recommended under local\ngovernment guidelines, we successfully continued to execute our business continuity plan and continued operating a work from home model, with certain employees returning to the office with safety protocols in place consistent with government guidelines. We rely significantly on the effectiveness of our information technology infrastructure to continue our operations and to continue to maintain appropriate controls over operations, treasury function, accounting and financial reporting.\nDue to the uncertainty over the timing and extent of any possible global economic recovery, we cannot readily estimate or determine the effects that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our future business and financial results, as well as on our liquidity and capital resources. Please see the COVID-19 commentary included throughout this MD&A, including -Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this annual report for additional information.\nOverview of Our Financial Results\nWe reported GAAP net loss of $8.6 million in 2021, compared to net income of $170.7 million in 2020. This decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the related discretionary bonus expense, resulting in lower incentive income and higher bonus expense in 2021 than in the prior year period, as discussed in the general overview section above. We recognized lower incentive income in 2021 than in the prior year period driven by more modest performance in our multi-strategy funds in the current year and an outsized crystallization of incentive income as a result of a multi-year crystallizations in our credit business in the prior year. The higher bonus expense in the current year was primarily driven by strong fund performance in our opportunistic credit funds and a new senior management compensation arrangement. Due to the timing that can impact our business, we recommend evaluating our results over a multi-year period and in connection with our ABURI disclosure.\n2021 benefited from improvement in our core earnings drivers compared to the prior year period. Management fees were higher as a result of higher AUM, and general, administrative and other expenses decreased as a result of legal provisions incurred in the prior year period. The net loss in 2021 was also offset by lower income tax expense, lower equity-based compensation and salaries and benefits expenses, and lower interest expense.\nThese improvements were offset by higher losses on early retirement of debt as we prepaid $224.4 million of our 2020 Term Loan in 2021, strengthening our balance sheet, and by higher loss from the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities, primarily due to an increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends paid during the year, and the change in risk-free rate.\nAdditionally impacting our net loss attributable to Class A Shareholders was an adjustment to the redemption value of the Class A Shares of Sculptor Acquisition Corporation I ( SAC I\u201d), our consolidated SPAC, that decreased net income attributable to our Class A Shareholders in 2021 by $25.9 million. In 2020, an adjustment of $7.0 million to the redemption value of the Preferred Units related to the accrual of distributions on the units decreased net income attributable to Class A Shareholders. Please see -Results of Operations\u201d for detailed discussion of the drivers of our results.\nEconomic Income was $119.4 million in 2021, compared to $306.1 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between recognition of incentive income from funds and the related discretionary bonus expense discussed above, partially offset by lower general, administrative and other expenses due to legal provisions incurred in 2020, higher management fees, lower salaries and benefits expense, and lower interest expense.\nEconomic Income is a non-GAAP measure. For additional information regarding non-GAAP measures, as well as for a discussion of the drivers of the year-over-year change in Economic Income, please see -Economic Income Analysis.\u201d\nOverview of AUM and Fund Performance\nAUM totaled $38.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. Longer-term AUM were $25.8 billion, comprising 68% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2021.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds totaled $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year. This change was driven by performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. 2021 marked the first time our multi-strategy fund had positive net inflows since 2014.\nSculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities. Please see -AUM and Fund Performance-Multi-Strategy Funds\u201d for additional information regarding the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund.\nAUM in our dedicated credit products totaled $22.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $417.3 million, or 2%, year-over-year. AUM in our opportunistic credit funds totaled $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, remaining relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows primarily in our open-end opportunistic credit funds, and $38.5 million of distributions, primarily in our closed-end opportunistic credit funds.\nFor the full year 2021, Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. Our Customized Credit Focused Platform, which invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate, generated a gross return of 21.8% and a net return of 17.2% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. In 2021, the funds' returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nAUM in Institutional Credit Strategies totaled $16.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $354.6 million, or 2%, year-over-year. CLO issuance remained active during the year, with the increase in AUM driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our CLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year primarily due to $708.3 million of net inflows driven by the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions.\nSince inception through December 31, 2021, the gross internal rate of return ( IRR\u201d) was 28.0% and 18.6% net for Sculptor Real Estate Fund III (for which the investment period ended in September 2019). Since inception through December 31, 2021, the gross IRR was 18.6% and 13.5% net for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nManaging Business Performance\nOur financial results are primarily driven by the combination of our AUM and the investment performance of our funds. Both of these factors directly affect the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. Growth in AUM due to capital placed with us by investors in our funds and positive investment performance of our funds drive growth in our revenues and earnings. Conversely, poor investment performance slows our growth by decreasing our AUM and increasing the potential for redemptions from our funds, which would have a negative effect on our revenues and earnings.\nWe typically accept capital from new and existing investors in our multi-strategy and certain open-end opportunistic credit funds on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. Investors in these funds (other than with respect to capital invested in Special Investments) typically have the right to redeem their interests in a fund following an initial lock-up period of one to four years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days prior written notice. The lock-up requirements for our funds may generally be waived or modified at the sole discretion of each funds' general partner or board of directors, as applicable.\nWith respect to investors with quarterly redemption rights, requests for redemptions submitted during a quarter generally reduce AUM on the first day of the following quarter. Accordingly, quarterly redemptions generally will have no impact on management fees during the quarter in which they are submitted. Instead, these redemptions will reduce management fees in the following quarter. With respect to investors with annual redemption rights, redemptions paid prior to the end of a quarter impact AUM in the quarter in which they are paid, and therefore impact management fees for that quarter.\nInvestors in our closed-end credit funds, securitization vehicles, real estate and certain other funds are not able to redeem their investments. In those funds, investors generally make a commitment that is funded over an investment period (or at launch for our securitization vehicles). Upon the expiration of the investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nInformation with respect to our AUM throughout this report, including the tables set forth below, includes investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our AUM represented investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties in our funds. As of that date, approximately 51% of these affiliated AUM are not charged management fees and are not subject to an incentive income calculation. Additionally, to the extent that a fund is an investor in another fund or vehicle, we waive or rebate a corresponding portion of the management fees charged to the fund.\nAs further discussed below in -Understanding Our Results-Revenues-Management Fees,\u201d we generally calculate management fees based on AUM as of the beginning of each quarter. The AUM in the tables below are presented net of management fees and incentive income as of the end of the period. Accordingly, the AUM presented in the tables below are not the amounts used to calculate management fees for the respective periods.\nAppreciation (depreciation) in the tables below reflects the aggregate net capital appreciation (depreciation) for the entire period and is presented on a total return basis, net of all fees and expenses (except incentive income on Special Investments), and includes the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Management fees and incentive income vary by product.\nSummary of Changes in AUM\nThe tables below present the changes to our AUM for the respective periods based on the type of funds or investment vehicles we manage.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the CLOs, foreign currency translation changes in the measurement of AUM of our European CLOs and changes in the portfolio appraisal value for aircraft securitization vehicles.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, AUM increased by $1.3 billion, driven by performance-related appreciation of $1.4 billion, net inflows of $2.9 billion, distributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion, and a decrease of $468.6 million primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in par value of underlying collateral of the CLOs.\nThe net inflows were comprised of (i) $4.8 billion of gross inflows, driven by $2.9 billion in Institutional Credit Strategies, due to the launches of additional CLOs and an aircraft securitization vehicle, $1.2 billion in multi-strategy funds, primarily driven by inflows into the Sculptor Master Fund, which had the first positive net flows since 2014, and $708.3 million in real estate funds, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles and our real estate SPAC; and (ii) $1.9 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds.\nDistributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion were driven primarily by $2.1 billion of distributions from Institutional Credit Strategies as a result of the wind down and redemptions of certain of our CLOs, and $470.6 million of distributions from our real estate funds as a result of realizations. In 2021, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from high net worth and family offices, sovereign wealth and corporates, and pensions, while pensions, fund-of-funds, and sovereign wealth and corporates were the largest source of gross outflows.\nAs of February 1, 2022, estimated AUM decreased to $37.9 billion, driven by $330.5 million of performance-related depreciation, $59.4 million of distributions and other reductions as a result of paydowns in our CLOs, as well as a decrease of $38.0 million primarily driven by foreign currency translation adjustments in our European CLOs. These decreases were partially offset by $235.9 million of net inflows, primarily in our multi-strategy funds.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, our funds experienced performance-related appreciation of $1.9 billion and net inflows of $2.0 billion. The net inflows were comprised of (i) $3.4 billion of gross inflows, driven by over $1.0 billion of new assets into our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit hedge funds, the final close of Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV and the launch of a European CLO and an aircraft securitization vehicle, and (ii) $1.4 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds. Distributions and other reductions of $1.7 billion were driven primarily by Institutional Credit Strategies, as a result of a decrease in the number of aircraft serving as collateral in certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles for which we act as collateral manager, and by our real estate funds, which was primarily due to the expiration of the investment period for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. In 2020, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from corporate and other institutions, pensions, and private banks, while pensions and private banks were the largest source of gross outflows.\nWeighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\nThe table below presents our weighted-average AUM and average management fee rates. Weighted-average AUM exclude the impact of fourth quarter investment performance for the periods presented, as these amounts generally do not impact\nmanagement fees calculated for those periods. The average management fee rates presented below take into account the effect of non-fee paying AUM.

The return information presented represents, where applicable, the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise each of the master funds presented. Gross return information is generally calculated using the total return of all feeder funds, net of all fees and expenses except management fees and incentive income of such feeder funds and master funds and the returns of each feeder fund include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Net return information is generally calculated as the gross returns less management fees and incentive income. Return information that includes Special Investments excludes incentive income on unrealized gains attributable to such investments, which could reduce returns at the time of realization. Special Investments and initial public offering investments are not allocated to all investors in the funds, and investors that were not allocated Special Investments and initial public offering investments may experience materially different returns.\nMulti-Strategy Funds\nSculptor's multi-strategy funds invest globally in high-conviction investment ideas across asset classes, regions and investment strategies with a primary focus is on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to direction of broader financial markets.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance for our multi-strategy funds. AUM are generally based on the net asset value of these funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees generally range from 1.00% to 2.00% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our multi-strategy funds had an average management fee rate of 1.24%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from the majority of our multi-strategy funds on an annual basis. Incentive income is generally equal to 20% of the realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor. A portion of the AUM in each of the Sculptor Master Fund and our other multi-strategy funds is subject to initial commitment periods of three years, and for certain of these assets, we only earn incentive income once profits attributable to an investor exceed a preferential return, or hurdle rate,\u201d which is generally equal to the 3-month T-bill rate for our multi-strategy funds. Once the investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate for these assets, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these assets.

Special Investments in the Sculptor Master Fund are held by investors representing a small percentage of AUM in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 8.5% gross and 5.7% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 25.3% gross and 18.6% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 16.2% gross and 11.3% net.\n(2)The annualized returns since inception are those of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite, which represents the composite performance of all accounts that were managed in accordance with our broad multi-strategy mandate that were not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion since inception on April 1, 1994. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts, and the returns include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. The performance calculation for the Sculptor Master Fund excludes realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to currency hedging specific to certain investors investing in Sculptor Master Fund in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the Sculptor Master Fund on January 1, 1998. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion, has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future. As of December 31, 2021, the annualized returns since the Sculptor Master Fund's inception on January 1, 1998 were 13.4% gross and 9.0% net excluding Special Investments and 13.0% gross and 8.9% net inclusive of Special Investments.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds increased $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year, primarily due to performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. In 2021, the largest sources of gross inflows into our multi-strategy funds were from high net worth and family offices and sovereign wealth and corporates, while the largest sources of gross outflows were attributable to pensions and high net worth and family offices.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0%. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 26.4% and a net return of 19.5%. Broad strength in risk assets rewarded our dynamic capital allocation and risk management framework. All of Sculptor Master Fund's risk-taking strategies generated positive performance in 2020.\nCredit Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Assets Under Management as of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opportunistic credit funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,350,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,287,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Institutional Credit Strategies </td> <td>16,052,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,697,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,402,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,985,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpportunistic Credit Funds\nOur opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally.\nCertain of our opportunistic credit funds are open-end and allow for contributions and redemptions (subject to initial lock-up and notice periods) on a periodic basis similar to our multi-strategy funds. Our remaining opportunistic credit funds are closed-end, whereby investors make a commitment that is funded over an investment period. Upon the expiration of an investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over a period of time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nAUM for our opportunistic credit funds are generally based on the net asset value of those funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees for our opportunistic credit funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.75% annually of the net asset value of these funds. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our opportunistic credit funds had an average management fee rate of 0.83%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds at the end of a multi-year measurement period. This results in a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the associated discretionary bonus expense. Incentive income accrued at the fund level that cannot yet be recognized drives an increase in our ABURI balance. Compensation expense related to ABURI generated from our opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are recognized by us.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance information for certain of our opportunistic credit funds. Incentive income related to these funds (excluding the closed-end opportunistic fund, which is explained further below) is generally equal to 20% of realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor, and a portion of these AUM is subject to hurdle rates, which are generally 5% to 8% for our open-end opportunistic credit funds. Once the cumulative investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these funds. The measurement periods for these AUM generally range from one to five years.

Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 22.3% gross and 17.3% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 0.7% gross and -1.8% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 13.8% gross and 9.9% net.\nAUM in our opportunistic credit funds remained relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven primarily by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. In 2021 the fund saw positive contributions from both corporate credit and structured credit in both the U.S. and Europe, and the fund's returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 1.1% and a net return of -1.5%. The gross return was primarily driven by broad-based positive performance in both spread-based investments where we added exposure during the crisis, in addition to a resurgence amongst our largest process-driven holdings. We deployed approximately $800.0 million of capital into credit in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic-related crisis, which helped drive a 23.1% net return for the fund from April 1, 2020 through year-end.\nOur Customized Credit Focused Platform invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate. The table below presents investment performance for the fund.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Return for the Year Ended December 31,(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Inception to Date as of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>IRR </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Invested Capital Multiple(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customized Credit Focused Platform </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net(4)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opportunistic Credit Performance(1)\n</td> <td>21.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7x </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Performance presented is for the opportunistic credit strategies in the Customized Credit Focused Platform. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 94% of the invested capital in the Customized Credit Focused Platform is invested in the Platform's opportunistic credit strategies.\n(2)Weighted Average Returns reflect the total profit & loss divided by the weighted average capital base, which represents net asset value plus net contributions (distributions) for the period.\n(3)Gross IRR represents estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax returns based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for each investment. It is calculated in the same manner as Net IRR, however, it does not reflect adjustments to cash flows related to incentive income, management fees and the applicable fund expenses. Gross IRR represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax return based on the actual and/or projected timing of cash inflows from, and outflows to, investors for each investment (irrespective of any funding from a credit facility or other third-party financing source used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform). In certain cases, funding from a credit facility or other third party financing source was initially used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform to acquire an investment or pay certain expenses, which may have the effect of increasing the Gross IRR above that which would have been presented, had drawdowns from limited partners been initially used to acquire the investment or pay such expenses. Gross IRR includes the effect of investment hedges as determined by the Company. There can be no assurance that an appropriate hedge will be identified for each investment or that an appropriate hedge will be available for all investments.\n(4)Net IRR is the Gross IRR adjusted to reflect actual management fees, incentive income and expenses incurred by the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n(5)Net invested capital multiple measures the current net asset value over the net invested capital, where net invested capital represents cumulative contributions less cumulative distributions. The Customized Credit Focused Platform has an active liquid investment program, a key element of which includes ramping up and ramping down depending on market conditions. Much of the capital has recently been deployed.\nThe table below presents AUM investment performance and other information for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds. Our closed-end opportunistic credit funds follow a European-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us only after a fund investor receives distributions in excess of their total contributed capital and a preferential return, which is generally 6% to 8%. Incentive income related to these funds is generally equal to 20% of the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund.

Gross IRR does not include the effects of management fees or incentive income, which would reduce the return, and includes the reinvestment of all fund income.\n(3)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (2), but is reduced by all management fees, as well as paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(4)Gross Multiple on Invested Capital ( MOIC\u201d) for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds is calculated by dividing the sum of the net asset value of the fund, accrued incentive income, life-to-date incentive income and management fees paid and any non-recallable distributions made from the fund by the invested capital.\nInstitutional Credit Strategies\nInstitutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs, aircraft securitization vehicles, CBOs, and other customized solutions for clients.\nAUM for Institutional Credit Strategies are generally based on the amount of equity outstanding for CLOs and CBOs (during the warehouse period), the par value of the collateral assets and cash held for CLOs and CBOs (after the warehouse period), and adjusted portfolio appraisal values for the aircraft collateral within the securitization vehicles. However, AUM are reduced for any investments in these CLOs and securitization vehicles held by our other funds. Management fees for Institutional Credit Strategies generally range from 0.25% to 0.50% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Institutional Credit Strategies had an average management fee rate of 0.42% gross of rebates on cross-investments from other funds we manage (0.29% net of such rebates). These average rates exclude the net impact of deferred subordinated management fees which were deferred in 2020 and fully recouped in 2021.\nIncentive income from our CLOs and CBO is generally equal to 20% of the excess cash flows due to the holders of the subordinated notes issued by the CLOs and CBO and is generally subject to a 12% hurdle rate. Because of the hurdle rate and structure of our CLOs and CBO, we do not expect to earn a meaningful amount of incentive income from these entities, and therefore no return information is presented for these vehicles. We do not earn incentive income from our aircraft securitization vehicles.

The year-over-year increase in AUM in Institutional Credit Strategies was driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our\nCLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value. Due to fee compression, our recent CLO launches have been at rates below our historical averages. Further in 2021, we priced twelve refinancing transactions in our existing CLOs extending the maturity of these transactions, but often at lower average net fees. Additionally, we refinanced our existing CBO in 2021. Refinancing CLOs and CBOs produces increased returns for subordinated note holders.\nReal Estate Funds\nOur real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets.\nAUM for our real estate funds are generally based on the amount of capital committed by our fund investors during the investment period and the amount of actual capital invested for periods following the investment period. AUM are reduced for unfunded commitments by our executive managing directors that will be funded through transfers from other funds. AUM for the special purpose acquisition company sponsored by us includes the proceeds raised in the initial public offering that are currently held in a trust for use in a business combination. Management fees for our real estate funds, exclusive of co-investment vehicles, generally range from 0.75% to 1.50% annually of AUM, however, management fees for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I are based on invested capital both during and after the investment period. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our real estate funds, inclusive of co-investment vehicles, had an average management fee rate of 0.79%.\nThe tables below present AUM, investment performance and other information for our real estate funds. The amounts included within co-investment and other funds\u201d below mainly relate to co-investment vehicles. Our real estate funds generally follow an American-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us after a fund investment is realized if a fund investor receives distributions in excess of the capital contributed for such investment, as well as a preferential return on such investment, which is generally 6% to 10%. Upon each subsequent realization, incentive income, which is generally 20% of realized profits, is recalculated based on the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund. Once the investment performance has exceeded the preferential rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the realized net profits attributable to investors in these funds.\nWe recognize incentive income on our real estate funds related to certain tax distributions on realizations at the fund level. Realizations at the fund level give rise to tax liabilities for our investors. Funds distribute capital back to investors to cover these tax liabilities and this in turn drives the recognition of tax distribution-related incentive income. In addition, incentive income is recognized as investments are sold and related distributions are made to investors. Due to the recalculation of cumulative realized profits upon each realization, the fund may clawback incentive income previously paid to us. As a result, we record incentive income paid to us by the real estate funds as unearned revenue in our consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for revenue recognition has been met.\nFor additional information on incentive income accrued at fund level for our real estate, as well as other funds, see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report.\nFor funds that have concluded their investment periods, we expect AUM to decrease as investments are sold and the related proceeds are distributed to the investors in these funds.

Gross IRR is not adjusted for estimated management fees, incentive income or other fees or expenses to be paid by the fund, which would reduce the return.\n(5)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (4), but is reduced by management fees and other fund-level fees and expenses not adjusted for in the calculation of gross IRR. Net IRR is further reduced by paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(6)Gross MOIC for our real estate funds is calculated by dividing the value of a fund's investments by the invested capital, prior to adjustments for incentive income, management fees or other expenses to be paid by the fund.\n(7)This fund has invested less than half of its committed capital; therefore, IRR and MOIC information is not presented, as it is not meaningful.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year due to net inflows of $708.3 million, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions. Our real estate funds continue to deploy capital and generate strong returns with an 18.6% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and 13.5% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nThe performance information presented in this Fund Performance Information\u201d section is not indicative of the performance of our Class A Shares and is not necessarily indicative of the future results of any particular fund, including the accrued unrecognized amounts of incentive income. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our existing or future funds will achieve similar results. The timing and amount of incentive income generated from our funds are inherently uncertain. Incentive income is a function of investment performance and realizations of investments, which vary period-to-period based on market conditions and other factors. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. Incentive income recognized for any particular period is not a reliable indicator of incentive income that may be earned in subsequent periods.\nLonger-Term AUM and Accrued But Unrecognized Incentive Income ( ABURI\u201d)\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 68% of our AUM were subject to initial commitment periods of three years or longer, excluding AUM that had initial commitment periods of three years or longer and subsequently moved to shorter commitment periods at the end of their initial commitment period. The table below presents the amount of these AUM.

As of December 31, 2021, our ABURI was $226.9 million, up $98.6 million since the end of 2020. In 2021, $198.5 million of ABURI was generated driven by strong performance in our opportunistic credit funds primarily from certain open ended credit funds, which will largely not crystallize until after a multi-year period and last crystallized in 2020, and from Real Estate Fund III and IV, which are not expected to crystallize until closer to the end of their respective fund life. We recognized $99.8 million of incentive income from longer-term AUM in 2021, primarily from tax distributions from our Customized Credit Focused Platform and several of our real estate funds, which reduced our ABURI balance\nOur ABURI from longer-term AUM generally comprise the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. Multi-strategy ABURI is derived from clients in the three-year liquidity tranche, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year period.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. Opportunistic credit funds ABURI is derived from three sources:\n\u25e6Clients in the three-year and four-year liquidity tranches of an open-end opportunistic credit fund, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year or four-year period\n\u25e6Long dated closed-end opportunistic credit funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized during each fund's harvest period after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients\n\u25e6The Customized Credit Focused Platform, where incentive income other than tax distributions is recognized at the end of a multi-year term; previously crystallized on December 31, 2020\n\u2022Real estate funds. Real Estate ABURI is derived from long-dated real estate funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will start to be recognized following the completion of each fund's investment period as investments are realized and after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients.\nCertain ABURI amounts presented above will generally have compensation expense (on an Economic Income Basis) that will reduce the amount ultimately realized on a net basis. Compensation expense relating to ABURI from our real estate funds is generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized. Compensation expense relating to ABURI generated from our multi-strategy funds and opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are generated.\nUnderstanding Our Results\nRevenues\nOur operations historically have been financed primarily by cash flows generated by our business. Our principal sources of revenues are management fees and incentive income. For any given period, our revenues are influenced by the amount of our AUM, the investment performance of our funds and the timing of when we recognize incentive income for certain AUM as discussed below.\nThe ability of investors to contribute capital to and redeem capital from our funds causes our AUM to fluctuate from period to period. Fluctuations in AUM also result from our funds' investment performance. Both of these factors directly impact the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. For example, a $1.0 billion increase or decrease in AUM subject to a 1% management fee would generally increase or decrease annual management fees by $10.0 million. If profits, net of management fees, attributable to a fee-paying fund investor were $10.0 million in a given year, we generally would earn incentive income equal to $2.0 million, assuming a 20% incentive income rate, a one-year commitment period, no hurdle rate and no high-water marks from prior years.\nFor any given quarter, our revenues are influenced by the combination of AUM and the investment performance of our funds. For example, incentive income for the majority of our multi-strategy AUM is recognized in the fourth quarter each year, based on full year investment performance.\nManagement Fees. Management fees are generally calculated and paid to us on a quarterly basis in advance, based on the amount of AUM at the beginning of the quarter. Management fees are prorated for capital inflows and redemptions during the quarter. Accordingly, changes in our management fee revenues from quarter to quarter are driven by changes in the quarterly opening balances of AUM, the relative magnitude and timing of inflows and redemptions during the respective quarter, the impact of differing management fee rates charged on those inflows and redemptions, as well as the impact of the deferral of subordinated management fees from certain CLOs. See -Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d for information on our average management fee rate and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding management fees.\nIncentive Income. We earn incentive income based on the cumulative performance of our funds over a commitment period. We recognize incentive income when such amounts are probable of not significantly reversing. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding incentive income.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of interest income on investments in CLOs, cash equivalents and long-term U.S. government obligations, as well as subrental income. Interest income is recognized on an effective yield basis. Subrental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIncome of Consolidated Entities. Revenues recorded as income of consolidated entities consist primarily of fee and other income.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of salaries, employee benefits, payroll taxes, and discretionary and guaranteed cash bonus expenses. We generally recognize compensation and benefits expenses over the related service period. Due to multi-year crystallizations in our credit and real estate funds, we may recognize discretionary bonus expense as incentive is generated at the fund level but before the Company recognizes the related incentive income. For additional information on incentive income recognized at fund level but not yet recognized by us see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report for additional information. We generally pay our bonuses in January of the year following the year in which bonuses were accrued.\nOn an annual basis, compensation and benefits comprise a significant portion of total expenses, with discretionary cash bonuses generally comprising a significant portion of total compensation and benefits. We accrue minimum annual discretionary cash bonuses on a straight-line basis during the year. The total amount of discretionary cash bonuses ultimately recognized for the full year, which is determined in the fourth quarter of each year, could differ materially from the minimum amount accrued, as the total discretionary cash bonus is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the year.\nCompensation and benefits also include equity-based compensation expense, which is primarily in the form of RSUs granted to our independent board members, employees and executive managing directors, as well as RSAs, PSUs and Partner Equity Units granted to executive managing directors.\nWe also have profit-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees or executive managing directors are entitled to a share of incentive income that we earn primarily from our real estate funds. This incentive income is typically paid to us and then we pay a portion to the profit-sharing participant as investments held by these funds are realized. To the extent that the payments to the employees or executive managing directors are probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue these payments as compensation expense for GAAP purposes, which may occur prior to the recognition of the related incentive income.\nDeferred cash interests ( DCIs\u201d) are also granted to certain employees and executive managing directors as a form of compensation. DCIs reflect notional fund investments made by us on behalf of an employee or executive managing director. DCIs generally vest over a three-year period, subject to an employee's or executive managing director's continued service. Upon vesting, we pay the employee or executive managing director an amount in cash equal to the notional investment represented by the DCIs, as adjusted for notional fund performance. Except as otherwise provided in the relevant DCI plan or in an award agreement, in the event of a termination of the employee's or executive managing director's service, any portion of the DCIs that is unvested as of the date of termination will be forfeited.\nSculptor's compensation structure is designed to align the interests of our executive managing directors and employees with those of investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Our compensation structure focuses on both individual and firm-wide performance through bonus compensation in a combination of equity and deferred cash interests that vest over time.\nInterest Expense. Amounts included within interest expense relate primarily to indebtedness outstanding.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other. General, administrative and other expenses are comprised of professional services, occupancy and equipment, information processing and communications, recurring placement and related service fees, business\ndevelopment, insurance, impairment of right-of-use lease assets, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous expenses. Legal settlements and provisions are also included within general, administrative and other.\nExpenses of Consolidated Entities. Expenses recorded as expenses of consolidated entities consist of general, administrative and other miscellaneous expenses.\nOther (Loss) Income\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities represent gains (losses) from changes in fair value of warrants.\nChanges in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability. Changes in tax receivable agreement liability consists of changes in our estimate of the future payments related to the tax receivable agreement that result from changes in future income tax savings due to changes in tax rates. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nNet Losses on Retirement of Debt. Net losses on retirement of debt consist of net losses realized upon the retirement of any indebtedness outstanding, and include the write-off of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, as well as other fees incurred in connection with the retirement of debt.\nNet Gains on Investments. Net gains on investments primarily consist of realized and unrealized net gains and losses on investments in U.S. government obligations and investments in our funds, including CLOs and other funds we manage.\nNet (Losses) Gains of Consolidated Entities. Net (losses) gains of consolidated entities primarily consist of changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities related to our consolidated SPAC.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes consist of our provision for federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and foreign income taxes, including provisions for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the tax and GAAP bases. The computation of the provision requires certain estimates and significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the expected taxable income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions, permanent differences between the tax and GAAP bases and the likelihood of being able to fully utilize deferred income tax assets existing as of the end of the period.\nThe Sculptor Operating Partnerships are partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Registrant was a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the Corporate Classification Change on April 1, 2019. Prior to the Corporate Classification Change, only a portion of the income we earned was subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Following the Corporate Classification Change, generally all of the income allocated to the Registrant from the Sculptor Operating Group will be subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. See Note 14 for additional information regarding significant items impacting our income tax provision and effective tax rate.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by parties other than us and are primarily made up of Group A Units. Increases or decreases in net (loss) income attributable to the Group A Units are driven by the earnings of the Sculptor Operating Group. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our ownership interest in the Sculptor Operating Group.\nIn 2021, we consolidated our SPAC, wherein investors are able to redeem Class A shares issued by the SPAC. Allocations of earnings to these shares are reflected within net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the net income (loss) attributable to SPAC investors' interests in the SPAC is driven primarily by interest income generated on cash and cash equivalents, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of the SPAC and various expenses related to legal costs, business development and insurance. Additionally, the accretion\nof the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value is recorded within change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders Table 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,605) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(179,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders from the prior year.\nRevenues Table 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>616,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(304,527) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>626,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>897,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(270,952) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues in 2021 were $626.1 million, decreasing $271.0 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $31.2 million increase in management fees, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $24.0 million increase in multi-strategy funds due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase in opportunistic credit funds due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.4 million increase in Institutional Credit Strategies due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022Real Estate Funds. A $2.8 million decrease in real estate funds due to lower management fees from both Real Estate Fund III and Real Estate Fund II, and related co-investment vehicles, due to lower average AUM as realizations decreased overall fund size.\nSee -AUM and Fund Performance-Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d above for information regarding our average management fee rates.\n\u2022A $304.5 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $124.7 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $1.9 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\n\u2022A $4.3 million increase in income of consolidated entities due to increase in other fee income of our consolidated entities compared to the prior year period.\nExpenses Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,514) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110,977) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>551,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111,486) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses in 2021 were $551.1 million, decreasing $111.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $111.0 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories.\n\u2022A $5.5 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balance as we repaid $224.4 million under the 2020 Term Loan and $19.9 million under a CLO Investment Loan in 2021.\n\u2022A $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses driven by various offsetting items, including a $25.9 million increase in bonus expense due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nNote that as our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\n\u25e6 The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $17.4 million decrease in equity-based compensation expense primarily due to: (i) a $13.4 million decrease in amounts related to Group E Units, as the remaining units are being amortized on an accelerated basis (i.e., each tranche is being amortized over its respective service period), resulting in decreasing expenses in each subsequent vesting year on these awards; and (ii) an $8.2 million decrease in amounts related to Group P Units as a result of the related service period ending during 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in RSU amortization primarily due to acceleration of the compensation cost as a result of separation-related compensation for a departing executive. In addition, salaries and benefits decreased by $6.3 million, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022A $2.8 million increase in expense of consolidated entities due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of the consolidated entities from the prior year period.\nOther Loss Table 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,460) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,548) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,912) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in tax receivable agreement liability </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,238) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,554) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,684) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses on retirement of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,011) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other (Loss) Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55,840) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(51,338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other loss in 2021 was $55.8 million, increasing $51.3 million, which resulted from the following:\n\u2022Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are the result of an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase our Class A Shares that were issued in connection with the 2020 Credit Agreement. The change was primarily due to the increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends, and the change in risk-free rate from the issuance date of the warrants to December 31, 2021. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details on warrants valuation inputs.\n\u2022Changes in tax receivable agreement liability. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are both a result of changes in projected future tax rates impacting the anticipated liability under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Net losses on retirement of debt. The amount in 2021 was primarily related to the $224.4 million prepayment of amounts outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million repayment of a CLO Investment Loan, while the amount in 2020 was primarily related to the $200.0 million and $45.0 million full repayments of amounts outstanding under the Debt Securities and 2018 Term Loan, respectively. The related losses on retirement of debt were comprised of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs that were proportionately written-off in connection with these repayments.\n\u2022Net gains on investments. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 both represent investment income on our equity method investments. In 2021, risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations both generated income, compared to losses in the prior year. Investment income increased by $926 thousand, primarily due to higher gains from risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations, partially offset by lower gains on our equity method investments, primarily due to lower gains from our multi-strategy fund investments.\nIncome Taxes Table 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61,567) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased by $61.6 million.

During the Distribution Holiday, net income earned by any Sculptor Operating Partnership is allocated 100% to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc., while losses are allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. as described in Note 4.\nIn 2021, Sculptor Capital LP, which earns most of our management fees and incurs most of our operating expenses, generated a smaller loss than in the prior year period, as operating expenses were lower and management fees were higher in 2021 compared to 2020. Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP, along with Sculptor Capital Advisors LP, earn most of our incentive income. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors LP generated losses that were allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP generated net income, and therefore we allocated 100% of its income to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. Income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to entities we consolidated in 2021.\nChange in Redemption Value of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Preferred Units\nThe following table presents the change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units: Table 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,924) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,952) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,972) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2021 was a loss of $25.9 million, increasing by $19.0 million from prior year. The amount in 2021 represents the accretion to redemption value of the Class A Shares related to our consolidated SPAC, while the amount in 2020 relates to adjustments to the redemption value of the Preferred Units, which were redeemed in full in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nEconomic Income Analysis\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on an Economic Income\u201d basis. Economic Income excludes the adjustments described below that are required for presentation of our results on a GAAP basis, but that management does not consider when evaluating operating performance in any given period. Management uses Economic Income as the basis on which it evaluates our financial performance and makes resource allocation and other operating decisions. Management considers it important that investors review the same operating information that it uses.\nEconomic Income is a measure of pre-tax operating performance that excludes the following from our results on a GAAP basis:\n\u2022Income allocations to our executive managing directors on their direct interests in the Sculptor Operating Group. Management reviews operating performance at the Sculptor Operating Group level, where our operations are performed, prior to making any income allocations.\n\u2022Equity-based compensation expenses, net of cash settled RSUs, depreciation and amortization expenses, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, net losses on retirement of debt, gains and losses on fixed assets, and gains and losses on investments in funds as management does not consider these items to be reflective of operating performance. The fair value of RSUs that are settled in cash to employees or executive managing directors, where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is not certain at the time of the grant, is included as an expense at the time of settlement. Where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is certain on the grant date, the expense is recognized during the performance period to which the award relates. Further, impairment of right-of-use lease assets is excluded from Economic Income at the time the impairment is recognized for GAAP and the impact is then amortized over the lease term for Economic Income. Additionally, rent expense is offset by subrental income as management evaluates rent expenses on a net basis.\n\u2022Amounts related to non-cash interest expense accretion on debt. The 2020 Term Loan and the Debt Securities were each recognized at a significant discount, as proceeds from each borrowing were allocated to warrant liabilities and the 2019 Preferred Units, respectively, resulting in non-cash accretion to par over time through interest expense for GAAP. Management excludes these non-cash expenses from Economic Income, as it does not consider them to be reflective of our economic borrowing costs.\n\u2022Amounts related to the consolidated entities, including the related eliminations of management fees and incentive income, as management reviews the total amount of management fees and incentive income earned in relation to total AUM and fund performance.\nIn addition, expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\nAs a result of the adjustments described above, as well as an adjustment to present management fees net of recurring placement and related service fees (rather than considering these fees an expense), management fees, incentive income, other revenues, compensation and benefits, interest expense, general, administrative and other expenses and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests as presented on an Economic Income basis are also non-GAAP measures.\nFor reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the respective GAAP measures, please see -Economic Income Reconciliations\u201d at the end of this MD&A.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to our GAAP net income allocated to Class A Shareholders or cash flow from operations, or as indicative of liquidity or the cash available to fund operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP)\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(186,740) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Economic Income from the prior year.\nEconomic Income Revenues (Non-GAAP) Table 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income Basis </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>280,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>616,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(302,827) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,822) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Economic Income Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>876,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(275,209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Income revenues in 2021 were $601.0 million, decreasing $275.2 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $30.4 million increase in management fees, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $20.4 million increase due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.8 million increase due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022A $302.8 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $123.0 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $2.8 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\nEconomic Income Expenses (Non-GAAP) Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income Basis </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>389,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,601) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and other expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125,776) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Economic Income Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>481,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>570,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(88,468) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Income expenses in 2021 were $481.7 million, decreasing $88.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $125.8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories, including reduction in occupancy expense due to a sublease, as we offset rental expense with subrental income for Economic Income.\n\u2022A $39.9 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses primarily driven by a $46.2 million increase in bonus expense, primarily due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6In addition, we recognized a significant amount of incentive income over the first three quarters with limited impact to bonus expense. Bonus expense related to this incentive income was expensed in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, which shifted attributable earnings into these quarters.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement, and a $32.2 million charge related to the issuance of certain cash-settled equity awards granted as part of 2021 bonuses, in place of RSUs, which were largely one-time in nature. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nAs our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\nNote that expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\n\u25e6 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred cash compensation grants. The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in headcount is expected to be temporary.\n\u2022A $2.6 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to interest no longer accruing on the Debt Securities or 2018 Term Loan, as these were repaid in full in the fourth quarter of 2020 in connection with the closing of the 2020 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by interest accruals on the 2020 Term Loan.\nFor the discussion of results of Economic Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Economic Income Analysis\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThe working capital needs of our business have historically been met, and we anticipate will continue to be met, through cash generated from management fees and incentive income earned from our funds.\nWe ended the year with $170.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $205.4 million of longer-term U.S. government obligations (Treasury bills) and $193.6 million of management fees and incentive income receivable (the majority of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2022). We also have access to an additional $25.0 million through our undrawn 2020 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan, leaving a balance of $95.0 million. In September 2021, we subleased a portion of our New York City office space. As a result of the sublease, we expect to save $14.3 million of rent costs through the lease maturity in 2029. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares, please see -Liquidity of Consolidated SPAC\u201d included in this annual report for additional information regarding SPACs.\nBased on management's experience and our current level of AUM, we believe that our current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from management fees will be sufficient to meet our anticipated fixed operating expenses (as defined below) and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For our longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund our fixed operating expenses through management fees and to fund discretionary cash bonuses and the repayment of our financing arrangements through a combination of management fees and incentive income. We may also decide to meet these requirements by issuing additional debt, equity or other securities.\nOver the long term, we believe we will continue to grow our AUM, including longer-term fee generating capital, and sustain positive investment performance in our funds, which will reflect positively on our revenue streams strengthening the balance sheet and providing the firm with stability to cover our long-term liquidity requirements.\nTo maintain maximum flexibility to meet demands and opportunities both in the short and long term, and subject to existing contractual arrangements, we may want to use cash on hand, issue additional equity or borrow additional funds to:\n\u2022Support the future growth in our business.\n\u2022Create new or enhance existing products and investment platforms.\n\u2022Repay amounts due under our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\n\u2022Repurchase Class A Shares or Sculptor Operating Group Units.\n\u2022Pursue new investment opportunities.\n\u2022Develop new distribution channels.\n\u2022Pay dividends.\nRecent Developments - Share Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The repurchase program has no expiration date. We may purchase shares on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or through the use of other techniques such as accelerated share repurchases. The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to our discretion based upon market conditions and other opportunities that we may have for the use or investment of our cash balances. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nLiquidity Needs\nOver the next 12 months, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to:\n\u2022Pay our operating expenses.\n\u2022Pay interest and principal on our financing arrangements.\n\u2022Provide capital to facilitate the growth of our business, including making risk retention investments in CLOs managed by us that are subject to EU and UK risk retention rules and fund capital commitments to our funds.\n\u2022Pay income taxes, RSU tax withholding obligations and amounts due under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy.\nOperating Expenses\nWe generally rely on management fees to cover our fixed\u201d operating expenses, which we define as salaries, benefits, a minimum discretionary bonus and general, administrative and other expenses, including upcoming lease payments as presented in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, incurred in the ordinary course of business. No assurances can be given that our management fees will be sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses in future periods. To the extent our management fees do not cover our fixed operating expenses, as well as to fund any other liabilities, we would rely on cash on hand and incentive income to cover any shortfall. We cannot predict the amount of incentive income, if any, that we may earn in any given year. Total annual revenues, which are heavily influenced by the amount of incentive income we earn, historically have been sufficient to fund both our fixed operating expenses and all of our other working capital needs, including annual discretionary cash bonuses. These cash bonuses, which historically have comprised our largest cash operating expense, are variable such that in any year where total annual revenues are greater or less than the prior year, cash bonuses may be adjusted accordingly. Our ability to scale our largest cash operating expense to our total annual revenues helps us manage our cash flow and liquidity position from year to year.\nHistorically, we have determined the amount of discretionary cash bonuses during the fourth quarter of each year, based on our total annual revenues and fund performance. We have historically funded these amounts through fourth quarter management fees and incentive income crystallized on December 31, which represents the majority of the incentive income we typically earn each year. Related to performance on longer-term AUM, we accrue bonus expense on ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense in the current year period. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods. In addition, to the extent our funds generate incentive income in the fourth quarter, we may elect to increase the amount of cash bonuses paid to employees over the amount already accrued throughout the year, with any incremental amounts recognized as expense in the fourth quarter. Although we cannot predict the amount, if any, of incentive income we may earn, we are able to regularly monitor expected management fees and we believe that we will be able to adjust our expense infrastructure, including discretionary cash bonuses, as needed to meet the requirements of our business and in order to maintain positive operating cash flows. Nevertheless, if we generate insufficient cash flows from operations to meet our short-term liquidity needs, we may have to borrow funds or sell assets, subject to existing contractual arrangements.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe may use cash on hand to pay interest and principal due on our financing arrangements, including debt obligations and repurchase agreements, prior to their respective maturity or due dates, which would reduce amounts available to distribute to our Class A Shareholders. We may also refinance all or a portion of any borrowings outstanding on or prior to their respective maturity dates. For any amounts unpaid as of a maturity or due date, we will be required to repay the remaining balance by using cash on hand, refinancing the remaining balance by incurring new debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or by issuing equity or other securities, which would dilute existing shareholders. See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for details on our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\nCLO Risk Retention Investments\nIn order to meet risk retention requirements for certain of the CLOs we manage, we use a combination of cash on hand, as well as financing under the CLO Investments Loans and repurchase agreements to fund our 5% risk retention investments. We expect to continue relying on a combination of cash on hand and financing to fund future CLO risk retention investments. Payments of interest and principal on these borrowings are generally due at such time interest and principal payments are received\non our risk retention investments in the related CLOs; therefore, our CLO risk retention investments and related financings generally have a net positive impact on our liquidity at each CLO interest and principal payment date.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have made, and may in the future be required to make, payments under the tax receivable agreement that we entered into with our executive managing directors and Ziff Investors Partnership, L.P. II and certain of its affiliates and control persons (the Ziffs\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we generate sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization resulting from the increase in tax basis of certain Sculptor Operating Group assets, we expected to pay our executive managing directors and the Ziffs approximately $195.8 million. Future cash savings and related payments to our executive managing directors under the tax receivable agreement in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement are anticipated to increase the tax basis adjustment and, consequently, result in increasing annual amortization deductions in the taxable years of and after such increases to the original basis adjustments, and potentially will give rise to increasing tax savings with respect to such years and correspondingly increasing payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement is an obligation of Sculptor Corp, and any other corporate taxpaying entities that hold Group B Units, and not of the Sculptor Operating Group. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent the Sculptor Operating Group does not distribute cash to Sculptor Corp in an amount sufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets resulting from an exchange or from payments under the tax receivable agreement, as well as the amortization thereof and the timing and amount of payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary based upon a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022The amount and timing of our income will impact the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement. To the extent that we do not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the amortization deductions available as a result of the increased tax basis in the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets, payments required under the tax receivable agreement would be reduced.\n\u2022The price of our Class A Shares at the time of any exchange will determine the actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets resulting from such exchange; payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from future exchanges, if any, will be dependent in part upon such actual increase in tax basis.\n\u2022The composition of the Sculptor Operating Group assets at the time of any exchange will determine the extent to which we may benefit from amortizing the increased tax basis in such assets and thus will impact the amount of future payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from any future exchanges.\n\u2022The extent to which future exchanges are taxable will impact the extent to which we will receive an increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets as a result of such exchanges, and thus will impact the benefit derived by us and the resulting payments, if any, to be made under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022The tax rates in effect at the time any potential tax savings are realized, which would affect the amount of any future payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nDepending upon the outcome of these factors, payments that we may be obligated to make to our current and former executive managing directors and the Ziffs under the tax receivable agreement in respect of exchanges could be substantial. In light of the numerous factors affecting our obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are not reasonably ascertainable.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe table below presents the cash dividends paid on our Class A Shares in 2021 and 2020. We did not declare a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021 in respect of earnings for the fourth quarter. We did not declare a dividend in the first three quarters of 2020 in respect of earnings for the first three quarters. Dividends are generally declared and paid in the quarter following the quarter to which they relate. For example, the dividend paid on November 22, 2021 was in respect of earnings for the third quarter of 2021. We paid no related cash distributions to our executive managing directors on their Sculptor Operating Group Units in the respective periods as a result of the Distribution Holiday.

During the Distribution Holiday, dividends may continue to be paid on our Class A Shares. As of December 31, 2021, we have generated a total of $469.7 million of Distribution Holiday Economic Income, compared to the target of $600.0 million.\nDistribution Holiday Economic Income is the cumulative amount of Economic Income earned since October 1, 2018, less any dividends paid to Class A Shareholders or on the now-retired Preferred Units. Distribution Holiday Economic Income is a non-GAAP measure that is defined in the agreements of limited partnership of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships and is being presented to provide an update on the progress made toward the $600.0 million target required to exit the Distribution Holiday. Please see -Distribution Holiday Economic Income Reconciliation\u201d for a reconciliation of Distribution Holiday Economic Income to net income attributable to Class A Shareholders.\nDuring the Distribution Holiday, we expect to pay dividends on our Class A Shares annually in an aggregate amount equal to not less than 20% or greater than 30% of our annual Economic Income less an estimate of payments under the tax receivable agreement, and income taxes related to the earnings for the periods; provided, that, if the minimum amount of dividends eligible to be made hereunder would be $1.00 or less per Class A Share, then up to $1.00 per Class A Share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any equity dividend, equity split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Class A Shares). During the Distribution Holiday, (i) we will only make distributions with respect to Group B Units, (ii) the performance thresholds of Group P Units and PSUs shall be adjusted to take into account performance and distributions during such period, and (iii) RSUs will continue to receive dividend equivalents in respect of dividends or distributions paid on the Class A Shares. For certain executive managing directors, distributions on RSUs, as well as distributions counted in determining whether market performance conditions of Group P Units and PSUs are met, are limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.00 per Group P Unit, PSU or RSU, as applicable, cumulatively during the Distribution Holiday. Following the termination of the Distribution Holiday, Group A Units and Group E Units (whether vested or unvested) shall receive distributions even if such units have not been booked-up. See Note 13 for additional information\nThe declaration and payment of any distribution may be subject to legal, contractual or other restrictions. For example, as a Delaware corporation, the Registrant's Board may only declare and pay dividends either out of its surplus (as defined in Delaware General Corporation Law) or in case there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Our cash needs and payment obligations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and we may have material unexpected expenses in any period. This may cause amounts available for distribution to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter or may reduce or eliminate such amounts.\nAdditionally, RSUs outstanding accrue dividend equivalents equal to the dividend amounts paid on our Class A Shares. To date, these dividend equivalents have been awarded in the form of additional RSUs, which accrue additional dividend equivalents. The dividend equivalents will only be paid if the related RSUs vest and will be settled at the same time as the underlying RSUs. Our Board of Directors has the right to determine whether the RSUs and any related dividend equivalents will be settled in Class A Shares or in cash. We currently withhold shares to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to vested RSUs and dividend equivalents held by our employees, which results in the use of cash from operations or borrowings to satisfy these tax-withholding payments.\nHistorically, when we have paid dividends on our Class A Shares, we also made distributions to our executive managing directors on their interests in the Sculptor Operating Group, subject to the terms of the limited partnership agreements of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships; however, as part of the Recapitalization, the Sculptor Operating Partnerships initiated the Distribution Holiday. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding the Distribution Holiday.\nOur cash distribution policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to our liquidity. Although we expect to pay distributions according to our policy, we may not make distributions according to our policy, or at all, if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the distribution. Furthermore, by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our obligations, operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to execute our business and growth strategy to the extent intended.\nRisks to Our Liquidity\nNet capital outflows from our multi-strategy funds over the last several years caused our management fees to decline for a period of time. While outflows have stabilized over the last couple of quarters and we continuously make every effort to scale our operations so that management fees are sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses, our management fees may not always cover these expenses. Additionally, in the event that a future contingent liability were to arise that exceeded our liquidity resources, we would need to rely on new sources of liquidity such as issuing additional equity or borrowing additional funds.\nAny new borrowing arrangement that we may enter into may have covenants that impose additional limitations on us, including with respect to making distributions, entering into business transactions or other matters, and may result in increased interest expense. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations on terms that are favorable to us, our business may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that we will be able to issue new notes, enter into new credit facilities or issue equity or other securities in the future on attractive terms or at all.\nAdverse market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk that our management fees and incentive income may decline if net outflows increase or as a result of performance-related depreciation in our funds. Lower revenues and other factors may make it more difficult or costly to raise or borrow additional funds, and excessive borrowing costs or other significant market barriers may limit or prevent us from maximizing our growth potential and flexibility. We have also evaluated our financing arrangements in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure compliance with debt covenants. Through the date of this filing, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants and expect to continue to be in compliance in the near term. Our ability to access financial markets, should it be necessary, may be limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur CLO risk retention financing arrangements are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants, but are subject to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type and also include terms that require our continued involvement with the CLOs. In addition to customary events of default included in financing arrangements of this type, the CLO Investments Loans may be accelerated to the extent there is an event of default ( EOD\u201d) at the CLO level. Prior to the relevant CLO's maturity date, this would include certain material covenant breaches, regulatory and insolvency events for the relevant CLO issuer, as well as a payment default where the relevant CLO is unable to make interest payments on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes issued by the CLO. For the repurchase agreements, in addition to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type, there are margin requirements that may cause us to post additional cash collateral; however, this is only triggered in the event of an EOD at the CLO level. Currently, we do not view any of the customary or CLO level EODs for these types of financing arrangements as a material risk. In particular, an EOD related to an\ninterest payment default on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes of the type of cash flow CLOs that we manage has been unprecedented even during the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009.\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark immediately after December 31, 2021, for sterling, euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023, the remaining U.S. Dollar settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had direct exposure to U.S. Dollar LIBOR-linked interest rate settings through its 2020 Credit Agreement, and certain CLO Investments and associated CLO Investment Loans.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we formed an internal LIBOR Transition Working Group to help effectuate an orderly transition from LIBOR. To address LIBOR cessation, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides for an agreed upon methodology to establish a new floating rate reference plus new applicable spreads. Each of the Company's CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans that reference U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will also be transitioned to an alternative reference rate. This transition will either be carried out through hardwired replacement mechanisms and/or amendment procedures in the existing governing documents for such CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans or as a result of New York statutory process (the New York LIBOR Legislation\u201d) which was signed into law on April 6, 2021. Additionally, the firm is pursuing several technology initiatives to ensure that firm-wide accounting and master data systems are equipped to handle evolving market conventions associated with regulatory recommended reference rates. We expect to complete these technology initiatives in the first half of 2022 and will continue to monitor for any future changes in market standards. Our senior management has oversight of the Company's transition efforts, and periodic updates are provided to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For the face value of instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition that we hold on our books see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our credit arrangements and our collateralized loan obligation transactions\u201d in this annual report for additional information.\nOur Funds' Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur funds have access to liquidity from our prime brokers and other counterparties. Additionally, our funds may have committed facilities in addition to regular financing from our counterparties. These sources of liquidity provide our funds with additional financing resources, allowing them to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.\nOur funds' current liquidity position could be adversely impacted by any substantial, unanticipated investor redemptions from our funds that are made within a short time period. As discussed above in -AUM and Fund Performance,\u201d capital contributions from investors in our multi-strategy and open-end opportunistic credit funds generally are subject to initial lock-up periods of one to three years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days' prior written notice. These lock-ups and redemption notice periods help us to manage our liquidity position. Investors in our other funds are generally not allowed to redeem until the end of the life of the fund.\nWe also follow a rigorous risk management process and regularly monitor the liquidity of our funds' portfolios in relation to economic and market factors and the timing of potential investor redemptions. As a result of this process, we may determine to reduce exposure or increase the liquidity of our funds' portfolios at any time, whether in response to global economic and market conditions, redemption requests or otherwise. For these reasons, we believe we will be well prepared to address market conditions and redemption requests, as well as any other events, with limited impact on our funds' liquidity position. Nevertheless, significant redemptions made during a single quarter could adversely affect our funds' liquidity position, as we may meet redemptions by using our funds' available cash or selling assets (possibly at a loss). Such actions would result in lower AUM, which would reduce the amount of management fees and incentive income we may earn. Our funds could also meet redemption requests by increasing leverage, provided we are able to obtain financing on reasonable terms, if at all. We believe our funds have sufficient liquidity to meet any anticipated redemptions for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity of Consolidated SPAC\nThe restricted cash and cash equivalents of SPAC are held in a trust account and include money market funds consisting of U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities of 60 days or less when purchased, that were purchased with funds raised through\nthe initial public offering of the consolidated entity. The $234.6 million in funds as of December 31, 2021, are restricted for use and may only be used for purposes of completing an initial business combination or redemption of public shares as set forth in the SPAC trust agreement.\nCash Flows Analysis\nOperating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $476.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Our net cash flows from operating activities are generally comprised of current-year management fees, the collection of incentive income earned during the fourth quarter of the previous year, interest income collected on our investments in CLO's, less cash used for operating expenses, including interest paid on our debt obligations.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased from the prior year period due to higher year-end incentive income earned in 2020 than in 2019, a large portion of the 2020 incentive was collected in the beginning of 2021, as compared to year-end incentive income earned in 2019, a large portion of which was collected in the beginning of 2020. Additionally, in 2021 we collected more incentive income from our real estate funds compared to 2020. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by higher discretionary bonuses in 2020, which were paid in the first quarter of 2021, as compared to discretionary bonuses in 2019, which were paid in the first quarter of 2020.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(190.3) million, and $15.4 million, respectively. Investing cash outflows in 2021 and 2020 primarily related to purchases of U.S. government obligations and investments made in our funds, partially offset by maturities and sales of U.S. government obligations.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(59.8) million, and $(82.7) million, respectively. Net cash from financing activities is generally comprised of dividends paid to our Class A Shareholders, borrowings and repayments related to our debt obligations, and proceeds from repurchase agreements used to finance risk retention investments in our CLOs. Distributions to our executive managing directors on their Group A Units (prior to the Distribution Holiday), are also included in net cash from financing activities. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares. These financing-related cash flows are of the consolidated entity and do not directly impact the cash flows related to our Class A Shareholders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million CLO Investment Loan. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the Debt Securities and the 2018 Term Loan, redeemed in full the 2019 Preferred Units, and borrowed $320.0 million under the 2020 Credit Agreement. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into $45.9 million of repurchase agreements to finance or refinance risk retention investments in our European CLOs.\nWe paid dividends of $84.2 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to dividends of $11.6 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the only dividend paid was in respect of the fourth quarter of 2019, which was paid on March 3, 2020. No distributions were made to our executive managing directors in the years ended December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020, as a result of the Distribution Holiday.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that require us to make significant judgments, estimates or assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements or the notes thereto. We base our judgments, estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and prudent. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our accounting policies. Set forth below is a summary of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nFair Value of Investments\nThe valuation of investments held by our funds is the most critical estimate made by management impacting our results. Pursuant to specialized accounting for investment companies under GAAP, investments held by the funds are carried at their\nestimated fair values. The valuation of investments held by our funds has a significant impact on our results, as our management fees and incentive income are generally determined based on the fair value of these investments.\nGAAP prioritizes the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of assets and liabilities and the specific characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities with readily available, actively quoted prices (Level I) or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices (Level II) generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value than those measured using pricing inputs that are unobservable in the market (Level III). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 40% within Level I; approximately 41% within Level II; and approximately 19% within Level III. As of December 31, 2020, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 35% within Level I; approximately 48% within Level II; and approximately 17% within Level III. The percentage of our funds' assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy will fluctuate based on the investments made at any given time and such fluctuations could be significant. A portion of our funds' Level III assets relate to Special Investments or other investments on which we do not earn any incentive income until such investments are sold or otherwise realized. Upon the sale or realization event of these assets, any realized profits are included in the calculation of incentive income for such year. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of our funds' Level III assets may not have any relation to the amount of incentive income actually earned with respect to such assets.\nValuation of Investments. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The fair value of our funds' investments is based on observable market prices when available. We, as the investment manager of our funds, determine the fair value of investments that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The methods and procedures to value these investments may include the following: performing comparisons with prices of comparable or similar securities; obtaining valuation-related information from the issuers; calculating the present value of future cash flows; assessing other analytical data and information relating to the investment that is an indication of value; obtaining information provided by third parties; and evaluating financial information provided by the management of these investments.\nSignificant judgment and estimation go into the assumptions that drive our valuation methodologies and procedures for assets that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The valuation of investments can be more difficult when severe economic and market shocks occur. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of such a shock. The actual amounts ultimately realized could differ materially from the values estimated based on the use of these methodologies. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected could result in losses at the fund level and a decline in future management fees and incentive income. Such situations may also negatively impact fund investor perception of our valuation policies and procedures, which could result in redemptions and difficulties in raising additional capital.\nWe have established an internal control infrastructure over the valuation of financial instruments that includes ongoing oversight by our Valuation Controls Group and Valuation Committee, as well as periodic audits by our Internal Audit function. These management control functions are segregated from the trading and investing functions.\nThe Valuation Committee is responsible for establishing the valuation policy and monitors compliance with the policy, ensuring that all of the funds' investments reflect fair value, as well as providing oversight of the valuation process. The valuation policy includes, but is not limited to the following: determining the pricing sources used to value specific investment classes; the selection of independent pricing services; performing due diligence of independent pricing services; and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy. The Valuation Committee reviews a variety of reports on a monthly basis, which include the following: summaries of the sources used to determine the value of the funds' investments; summaries of the fair value hierarchy of the funds' investments; methodology changes and variance reports that compare the values of investments to\nindependent pricing services. The Valuation Committee is independent from the investment professionals and may obtain input from investment professionals for consideration in carrying out its responsibilities.\nThe Valuation Committee has assigned the responsibility of performing price verification and related quality controls in accordance with the valuation policy to the Valuation Controls Group. The Valuation Controls Group's other responsibilities include the following: overseeing the collection and evaluation of counterparty prices, broker-dealer quotations, exchange prices and pricing information provided by independent pricing services. Additionally, the Valuation Controls Group is responsible for performing back testing by comparing prices observed in executed transactions to valuations provided by independent pricing service providers on a monthly basis; performing stale pricing analysis on a monthly basis; performing due diligence reviews on independent pricing services on an annual basis; and recommending changes in valuation policies to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Controls Group also verifies that indicative broker quotations used to value certain investments are representative of fair value through procedures such as comparison to independent pricing services, back testing procedures, review of stale pricing reports and performance of other due diligence procedures as may be deemed necessary.\nInvestment professionals and members of the Valuation Controls Group review a daily profit and loss report, as well as other periodic reports that analyze the profit and loss and related asset class exposure of the funds' investments.\nThe Internal Audit function employs a risk-based program of audit coverage that is designed to provide an assessment of the design and effectiveness of controls over our operations, regulatory compliance, valuation of financial instruments and reporting. Additionally, the Internal Audit function meets periodically with management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to evaluate and provide guidance on the existing risk framework and control environment assessments.\nFor information regarding the impact that the fair value measurement of AUM has on our results, please see Part II-", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds.\nOverview\nGeneral\n2021 marked a new chapter at Sculptor as we continued to execute on our business plan. We began this chapter with a strong foundation after focusing over the last few years on building business stability. The following accomplishments were key to evolving the business to where it stands today, with sustained investment performance, improved investor flows and a stronger balance sheet.\nFirst, we continued to deliver sustained investment performance across our funds for our clients over most measurable time horizons. Sculptor Master Fund was up 5.0% net for full year 2021 and Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund and Customized Credit Focused Platform were up 17.0% and 17.2% net, respectively, for the full year 2021.\nSecond, our funds have stabilized their asset base and we have seen progress in our flows. This began by normalizing redemption levels and then building the pipeline for flows. Gross inflows in the multi-strategy funds were 11.3% of beginning AUM for 2021. This improvement, coupled with normalized redemption rates, led to the first year of positive net flows into the multi-strategy funds since 2014. Increases in our asset base from flows and fund performance have driven the rise in our management fee earnings. We have also been able to evolve our product mix from shorter-duration to longer-duration products. Our longer-term AUM has increased to 68% in 2021 from 26% in 2013. As a result, our asset base has increased longevity, creating consistency in our management fees.\nThird, we have strengthened our balance sheet. We refinanced our liabilities at the end of 2020 and have since paid down $224 million of term debt this year, the lowest level of debt since our IPO in 2007\nGiven the above, we believe the fundamentals driving our earnings are sound and growing. Our management fees are up $31 million year-over-year. Our earnings, excluding the benefit of incentive income and the associated variable bonus expense, which includes management fees less fixed expenses (salaries and benefits, minimum discretionary bonus, and general, administrative, and other expenses) has gone from negative to positive over the last two years. This is a function of growing management fees while cutting or maintaining fixed expenses noted above.\nWhile the business fundamentals are sound, the earnings for any given year can have volatility due to annual performance or incentive fee recognition timing. Over time, we created greater consistency in management fees as our longer-term AUM grew. With that also comes volatility in overall earnings due to the impact of longer-term AUM on incentive fee recognition and associated variable bonus expense timing. There is a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue our discretionary bonus expense, which is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the full calendar year. Incentive income for this longer-term AUM is typically recognized near the end of a multi-year period, which can create year-over-year volatility in incentive income.\nGiven the above, when we evaluate our business, we look to the underlying earnings drivers of the organization which will drive future returns to shareholders. These key indicators include strong fund performance and incremental net flows compounding our asset base, continuing to be cognizant of our cost framework, and growing and utilizing our balance sheet to invest in the growth of the business.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we continued to focus on the health and well-being of our employees and the uninterrupted service to investors in our funds and our shareholders. Where appropriate or recommended under local\ngovernment guidelines, we successfully continued to execute our business continuity plan and continued operating a work from home model, with certain employees returning to the office with safety protocols in place consistent with government guidelines. We rely significantly on the effectiveness of our information technology infrastructure to continue our operations and to continue to maintain appropriate controls over operations, treasury function, accounting and financial reporting.\nDue to the uncertainty over the timing and extent of any possible global economic recovery, we cannot readily estimate or determine the effects that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our future business and financial results, as well as on our liquidity and capital resources. Please see the COVID-19 commentary included throughout this MD&A, including -Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this annual report for additional information.\nOverview of Our Financial Results\nWe reported GAAP net loss of $8.6 million in 2021, compared to net income of $170.7 million in 2020. This decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the related discretionary bonus expense, resulting in lower incentive income and higher bonus expense in 2021 than in the prior year period, as discussed in the general overview section above. We recognized lower incentive income in 2021 than in the prior year period driven by more modest performance in our multi-strategy funds in the current year and an outsized crystallization of incentive income as a result of a multi-year crystallizations in our credit business in the prior year. The higher bonus expense in the current year was primarily driven by strong fund performance in our opportunistic credit funds and a new senior management compensation arrangement. Due to the timing that can impact our business, we recommend evaluating our results over a multi-year period and in connection with our ABURI disclosure.\n2021 benefited from improvement in our core earnings drivers compared to the prior year period. Management fees were higher as a result of higher AUM, and general, administrative and other expenses decreased as a result of legal provisions incurred in the prior year period. The net loss in 2021 was also offset by lower income tax expense, lower equity-based compensation and salaries and benefits expenses, and lower interest expense.\nThese improvements were offset by higher losses on early retirement of debt as we prepaid $224.4 million of our 2020 Term Loan in 2021, strengthening our balance sheet, and by higher loss from the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities, primarily due to an increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends paid during the year, and the change in risk-free rate.\nAdditionally impacting our net loss attributable to Class A Shareholders was an adjustment to the redemption value of the Class A Shares of Sculptor Acquisition Corporation I ( SAC I\u201d), our consolidated SPAC, that decreased net income attributable to our Class A Shareholders in 2021 by $25.9 million. In 2020, an adjustment of $7.0 million to the redemption value of the Preferred Units related to the accrual of distributions on the units decreased net income attributable to Class A Shareholders. Please see -Results of Operations\u201d for detailed discussion of the drivers of our results.\nEconomic Income was $119.4 million in 2021, compared to $306.1 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between recognition of incentive income from funds and the related discretionary bonus expense discussed above, partially offset by lower general, administrative and other expenses due to legal provisions incurred in 2020, higher management fees, lower salaries and benefits expense, and lower interest expense.\nEconomic Income is a non-GAAP measure. For additional information regarding non-GAAP measures, as well as for a discussion of the drivers of the year-over-year change in Economic Income, please see -Economic Income Analysis.\u201d\nOverview of AUM and Fund Performance\nAUM totaled $38.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. Longer-term AUM were $25.8 billion, comprising 68% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2021.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds totaled $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year. This change was driven by performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. 2021 marked the first time our multi-strategy fund had positive net inflows since 2014.\nSculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities. Please see -AUM and Fund Performance-Multi-Strategy Funds\u201d for additional information regarding the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund.\nAUM in our dedicated credit products totaled $22.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $417.3 million, or 2%, year-over-year. AUM in our opportunistic credit funds totaled $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, remaining relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows primarily in our open-end opportunistic credit funds, and $38.5 million of distributions, primarily in our closed-end opportunistic credit funds.\nFor the full year 2021, Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. Our Customized Credit Focused Platform, which invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate, generated a gross return of 21.8% and a net return of 17.2% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. In 2021, the funds' returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nAUM in Institutional Credit Strategies totaled $16.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $354.6 million, or 2%, year-over-year. CLO issuance remained active during the year, with the increase in AUM driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our CLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year primarily due to $708.3 million of net inflows driven by the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions.\nSince inception through December 31, 2021, the gross internal rate of return ( IRR\u201d) was 28.0% and 18.6% net for Sculptor Real Estate Fund III (for which the investment period ended in September 2019). Since inception through December 31, 2021, the gross IRR was 18.6% and 13.5% net for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nManaging Business Performance\nOur financial results are primarily driven by the combination of our AUM and the investment performance of our funds. Both of these factors directly affect the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. Growth in AUM due to capital placed with us by investors in our funds and positive investment performance of our funds drive growth in our revenues and earnings. Conversely, poor investment performance slows our growth by decreasing our AUM and increasing the potential for redemptions from our funds, which would have a negative effect on our revenues and earnings.\nWe typically accept capital from new and existing investors in our multi-strategy and certain open-end opportunistic credit funds on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. Investors in these funds (other than with respect to capital invested in Special Investments) typically have the right to redeem their interests in a fund following an initial lock-up period of one to four years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days prior written notice. The lock-up requirements for our funds may generally be waived or modified at the sole discretion of each funds' general partner or board of directors, as applicable.\nWith respect to investors with quarterly redemption rights, requests for redemptions submitted during a quarter generally reduce AUM on the first day of the following quarter. Accordingly, quarterly redemptions generally will have no impact on management fees during the quarter in which they are submitted. Instead, these redemptions will reduce management fees in the following quarter. With respect to investors with annual redemption rights, redemptions paid prior to the end of a quarter impact AUM in the quarter in which they are paid, and therefore impact management fees for that quarter.\nInvestors in our closed-end credit funds, securitization vehicles, real estate and certain other funds are not able to redeem their investments. In those funds, investors generally make a commitment that is funded over an investment period (or at launch for our securitization vehicles). Upon the expiration of the investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nInformation with respect to our AUM throughout this report, including the tables set forth below, includes investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our AUM represented investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties in our funds. As of that date, approximately 51% of these affiliated AUM are not charged management fees and are not subject to an incentive income calculation. Additionally, to the extent that a fund is an investor in another fund or vehicle, we waive or rebate a corresponding portion of the management fees charged to the fund.\nAs further discussed below in -Understanding Our Results-Revenues-Management Fees,\u201d we generally calculate management fees based on AUM as of the beginning of each quarter. The AUM in the tables below are presented net of management fees and incentive income as of the end of the period. Accordingly, the AUM presented in the tables below are not the amounts used to calculate management fees for the respective periods.\nAppreciation (depreciation) in the tables below reflects the aggregate net capital appreciation (depreciation) for the entire period and is presented on a total return basis, net of all fees and expenses (except incentive income on Special Investments), and includes the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Management fees and incentive income vary by product.\nSummary of Changes in AUM\nThe tables below present the changes to our AUM for the respective periods based on the type of funds or investment vehicles we manage.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the CLOs, foreign currency translation changes in the measurement of AUM of our European CLOs and changes in the portfolio appraisal value for aircraft securitization vehicles.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, AUM increased by $1.3 billion, driven by performance-related appreciation of $1.4 billion, net inflows of $2.9 billion, distributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion, and a decrease of $468.6 million primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in par value of underlying collateral of the CLOs.\nThe net inflows were comprised of (i) $4.8 billion of gross inflows, driven by $2.9 billion in Institutional Credit Strategies, due to the launches of additional CLOs and an aircraft securitization vehicle, $1.2 billion in multi-strategy funds, primarily driven by inflows into the Sculptor Master Fund, which had the first positive net flows since 2014, and $708.3 million in real estate funds, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles and our real estate SPAC; and (ii) $1.9 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds.\nDistributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion were driven primarily by $2.1 billion of distributions from Institutional Credit Strategies as a result of the wind down and redemptions of certain of our CLOs, and $470.6 million of distributions from our real estate funds as a result of realizations. In 2021, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from high net worth and family offices, sovereign wealth and corporates, and pensions, while pensions, fund-of-funds, and sovereign wealth and corporates were the largest source of gross outflows.\nAs of February 1, 2022, estimated AUM decreased to $37.9 billion, driven by $330.5 million of performance-related depreciation, $59.4 million of distributions and other reductions as a result of paydowns in our CLOs, as well as a decrease of $38.0 million primarily driven by foreign currency translation adjustments in our European CLOs. These decreases were partially offset by $235.9 million of net inflows, primarily in our multi-strategy funds.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, our funds experienced performance-related appreciation of $1.9 billion and net inflows of $2.0 billion. The net inflows were comprised of (i) $3.4 billion of gross inflows, driven by over $1.0 billion of new assets into our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit hedge funds, the final close of Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV and the launch of a European CLO and an aircraft securitization vehicle, and (ii) $1.4 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds. Distributions and other reductions of $1.7 billion were driven primarily by Institutional Credit Strategies, as a result of a decrease in the number of aircraft serving as collateral in certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles for which we act as collateral manager, and by our real estate funds, which was primarily due to the expiration of the investment period for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. In 2020, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from corporate and other institutions, pensions, and private banks, while pensions and private banks were the largest source of gross outflows.\nWeighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\nThe table below presents our weighted-average AUM and average management fee rates. Weighted-average AUM exclude the impact of fourth quarter investment performance for the periods presented, as these amounts generally do not impact\nmanagement fees calculated for those periods. The average management fee rates presented below take into account the effect of non-fee paying AUM.

The return information presented represents, where applicable, the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise each of the master funds presented. Gross return information is generally calculated using the total return of all feeder funds, net of all fees and expenses except management fees and incentive income of such feeder funds and master funds and the returns of each feeder fund include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Net return information is generally calculated as the gross returns less management fees and incentive income. Return information that includes Special Investments excludes incentive income on unrealized gains attributable to such investments, which could reduce returns at the time of realization. Special Investments and initial public offering investments are not allocated to all investors in the funds, and investors that were not allocated Special Investments and initial public offering investments may experience materially different returns.\nMulti-Strategy Funds\nSculptor's multi-strategy funds invest globally in high-conviction investment ideas across asset classes, regions and investment strategies with a primary focus is on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to direction of broader financial markets.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance for our multi-strategy funds. AUM are generally based on the net asset value of these funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees generally range from 1.00% to 2.00% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our multi-strategy funds had an average management fee rate of 1.24%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from the majority of our multi-strategy funds on an annual basis. Incentive income is generally equal to 20% of the realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor. A portion of the AUM in each of the Sculptor Master Fund and our other multi-strategy funds is subject to initial commitment periods of three years, and for certain of these assets, we only earn incentive income once profits attributable to an investor exceed a preferential return, or hurdle rate,\u201d which is generally equal to the 3-month T-bill rate for our multi-strategy funds. Once the investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate for these assets, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these assets.

Special Investments in the Sculptor Master Fund are held by investors representing a small percentage of AUM in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 8.5% gross and 5.7% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 25.3% gross and 18.6% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 16.2% gross and 11.3% net.\n(2)The annualized returns since inception are those of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite, which represents the composite performance of all accounts that were managed in accordance with our broad multi-strategy mandate that were not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion since inception on April 1, 1994. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts, and the returns include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. The performance calculation for the Sculptor Master Fund excludes realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to currency hedging specific to certain investors investing in Sculptor Master Fund in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the Sculptor Master Fund on January 1, 1998. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion, has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future. As of December 31, 2021, the annualized returns since the Sculptor Master Fund's inception on January 1, 1998 were 13.4% gross and 9.0% net excluding Special Investments and 13.0% gross and 8.9% net inclusive of Special Investments.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds increased $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year, primarily due to performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. In 2021, the largest sources of gross inflows into our multi-strategy funds were from high net worth and family offices and sovereign wealth and corporates, while the largest sources of gross outflows were attributable to pensions and high net worth and family offices.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0%. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 26.4% and a net return of 19.5%. Broad strength in risk assets rewarded our dynamic capital allocation and risk management framework. All of Sculptor Master Fund's risk-taking strategies generated positive performance in 2020.\nCredit Table 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Assets Under Management as of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opportunistic credit funds </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,350,474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,287,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Institutional Credit Strategies </td> <td>16,052,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,697,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,402,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,985,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOpportunistic Credit Funds\nOur opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally.\nCertain of our opportunistic credit funds are open-end and allow for contributions and redemptions (subject to initial lock-up and notice periods) on a periodic basis similar to our multi-strategy funds. Our remaining opportunistic credit funds are closed-end, whereby investors make a commitment that is funded over an investment period. Upon the expiration of an investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over a period of time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nAUM for our opportunistic credit funds are generally based on the net asset value of those funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees for our opportunistic credit funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.75% annually of the net asset value of these funds. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our opportunistic credit funds had an average management fee rate of 0.83%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds at the end of a multi-year measurement period. This results in a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the associated discretionary bonus expense. Incentive income accrued at the fund level that cannot yet be recognized drives an increase in our ABURI balance. Compensation expense related to ABURI generated from our opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are recognized by us.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance information for certain of our opportunistic credit funds. Incentive income related to these funds (excluding the closed-end opportunistic fund, which is explained further below) is generally equal to 20% of realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor, and a portion of these AUM is subject to hurdle rates, which are generally 5% to 8% for our open-end opportunistic credit funds. Once the cumulative investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these funds. The measurement periods for these AUM generally range from one to five years.

Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 22.3% gross and 17.3% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 0.7% gross and -1.8% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 13.8% gross and 9.9% net.\nAUM in our opportunistic credit funds remained relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven primarily by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. In 2021 the fund saw positive contributions from both corporate credit and structured credit in both the U.S. and Europe, and the fund's returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 1.1% and a net return of -1.5%. The gross return was primarily driven by broad-based positive performance in both spread-based investments where we added exposure during the crisis, in addition to a resurgence amongst our largest process-driven holdings. We deployed approximately $800.0 million of capital into credit in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic-related crisis, which helped drive a 23.1% net return for the fund from April 1, 2020 through year-end.\nOur Customized Credit Focused Platform invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate. The table below presents investment performance for the fund.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Return for the Year Ended December 31,(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Inception to Date as of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>IRR </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Invested Capital Multiple(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customized Credit Focused Platform </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross </td> <td> </td> <td>Net </td> <td> </td> <td>Gross(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net(4)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Opportunistic Credit Performance(1)\n</td> <td>21.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7x </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n(1)Performance presented is for the opportunistic credit strategies in the Customized Credit Focused Platform. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 94% of the invested capital in the Customized Credit Focused Platform is invested in the Platform's opportunistic credit strategies.\n(2)Weighted Average Returns reflect the total profit & loss divided by the weighted average capital base, which represents net asset value plus net contributions (distributions) for the period.\n(3)Gross IRR represents estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax returns based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for each investment. It is calculated in the same manner as Net IRR, however, it does not reflect adjustments to cash flows related to incentive income, management fees and the applicable fund expenses. Gross IRR represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax return based on the actual and/or projected timing of cash inflows from, and outflows to, investors for each investment (irrespective of any funding from a credit facility or other third-party financing source used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform). In certain cases, funding from a credit facility or other third party financing source was initially used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform to acquire an investment or pay certain expenses, which may have the effect of increasing the Gross IRR above that which would have been presented, had drawdowns from limited partners been initially used to acquire the investment or pay such expenses. Gross IRR includes the effect of investment hedges as determined by the Company. There can be no assurance that an appropriate hedge will be identified for each investment or that an appropriate hedge will be available for all investments.\n(4)Net IRR is the Gross IRR adjusted to reflect actual management fees, incentive income and expenses incurred by the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n(5)Net invested capital multiple measures the current net asset value over the net invested capital, where net invested capital represents cumulative contributions less cumulative distributions. The Customized Credit Focused Platform has an active liquid investment program, a key element of which includes ramping up and ramping down depending on market conditions. Much of the capital has recently been deployed.\nThe table below presents AUM investment performance and other information for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds. Our closed-end opportunistic credit funds follow a European-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us only after a fund investor receives distributions in excess of their total contributed capital and a preferential return, which is generally 6% to 8%. Incentive income related to these funds is generally equal to 20% of the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund. Once the investment performance has exceeded the preferential return, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these funds. These funds have concluded their investment periods, and therefore we expect AUM for these funds to decrease as investments are sold and the related proceeds are distributed to the investors in these funds.

Gross IRR does not include the effects of management fees or incentive income, which would reduce the return, and includes the reinvestment of all fund income.\n(3)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (2), but is reduced by all management fees, as well as paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(4)Gross Multiple on Invested Capital ( MOIC\u201d) for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds is calculated by dividing the sum of the net asset value of the fund, accrued incentive income, life-to-date incentive income and management fees paid and any non-recallable distributions made from the fund by the invested capital.\nInstitutional Credit Strategies\nInstitutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs, aircraft securitization vehicles, CBOs, and other customized solutions for clients.\nAUM for Institutional Credit Strategies are generally based on the amount of equity outstanding for CLOs and CBOs (during the warehouse period), the par value of the collateral assets and cash held for CLOs and CBOs (after the warehouse period), and adjusted portfolio appraisal values for the aircraft collateral within the securitization vehicles. However, AUM are reduced for any investments in these CLOs and securitization vehicles held by our other funds. Management fees for Institutional Credit Strategies generally range from 0.25% to 0.50% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Institutional Credit Strategies had an average management fee rate of 0.42% gross of rebates on cross-investments from other funds we manage (0.29% net of such rebates). These average rates exclude the net impact of deferred subordinated management fees which were deferred in 2020 and fully recouped in 2021.\nIncentive income from our CLOs and CBO is generally equal to 20% of the excess cash flows due to the holders of the subordinated notes issued by the CLOs and CBO and is generally subject to a 12% hurdle rate. Because of the hurdle rate and structure of our CLOs and CBO, we do not expect to earn a meaningful amount of incentive income from these entities, and therefore no return information is presented for these vehicles. We do not earn incentive income from our aircraft securitization vehicles.

The year-over-year increase in AUM in Institutional Credit Strategies was driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our\nCLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value. Due to fee compression, our recent CLO launches have been at rates below our historical averages. Further in 2021, we priced twelve refinancing transactions in our existing CLOs extending the maturity of these transactions, but often at lower average net fees. Additionally, we refinanced our existing CBO in 2021. Refinancing CLOs and CBOs produces increased returns for subordinated note holders.\nReal Estate Funds\nOur real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets.\nAUM for our real estate funds are generally based on the amount of capital committed by our fund investors during the investment period and the amount of actual capital invested for periods following the investment period. AUM are reduced for unfunded commitments by our executive managing directors that will be funded through transfers from other funds. AUM for the special purpose acquisition company sponsored by us includes the proceeds raised in the initial public offering that are currently held in a trust for use in a business combination. Management fees for our real estate funds, exclusive of co-investment vehicles, generally range from 0.75% to 1.50% annually of AUM, however, management fees for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I are based on invested capital both during and after the investment period. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our real estate funds, inclusive of co-investment vehicles, had an average management fee rate of 0.79%.\nThe tables below present AUM, investment performance and other information for our real estate funds. The amounts included within co-investment and other funds\u201d below mainly relate to co-investment vehicles. Our real estate funds generally follow an American-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us after a fund investment is realized if a fund investor receives distributions in excess of the capital contributed for such investment, as well as a preferential return on such investment, which is generally 6% to 10%. Upon each subsequent realization, incentive income, which is generally 20% of realized profits, is recalculated based on the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund. Once the investment performance has exceeded the preferential rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the realized net profits attributable to investors in these funds.\nWe recognize incentive income on our real estate funds related to certain tax distributions on realizations at the fund level. Realizations at the fund level give rise to tax liabilities for our investors. Funds distribute capital back to investors to cover these tax liabilities and this in turn drives the recognition of tax distribution-related incentive income. In addition, incentive income is recognized as investments are sold and related distributions are made to investors. Due to the recalculation of cumulative realized profits upon each realization, the fund may clawback incentive income previously paid to us. As a result, we record incentive income paid to us by the real estate funds as unearned revenue in our consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for revenue recognition has been met.\nFor additional information on incentive income accrued at fund level for our real estate, as well as other funds, see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report.\nFor funds that have concluded their investment periods, we expect AUM to decrease as investments are sold and the related proceeds are distributed to the investors in these funds.

including dividends, interest or other distributions of income and return of capital, represents at least 50% of invested capital.\n(2)Invested capital represents total aggregate contributions made for investments by the fund.\n(3)Total value represents the sum of realized distributions and the fair value of unrealized and partially realized investments as of December 31, 2021. Total value will be impacted (either positively or negatively) by future economic and other factors. Accordingly, the total value ultimately realized will likely be higher or lower than the amounts presented as of December 31, 2021.\n(4)Gross IRR for our real estate funds represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized return based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for the aggregated investments as of December 31, 2021, including the fair value of unrealized and partially realized investments as of such date, together with any unrealized appreciation or depreciation from related hedging activity. Gross IRR is not adjusted for estimated management fees, incentive income or other fees or expenses to be paid by the fund, which would reduce the return.\n(5)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (4), but is reduced by management fees and other fund-level fees and expenses not adjusted for in the calculation of gross IRR. Net IRR is further reduced by paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(6)Gross MOIC for our real estate funds is calculated by dividing the value of a fund's investments by the invested capital, prior to adjustments for incentive income, management fees or other expenses to be paid by the fund.\n(7)This fund has invested less than half of its committed capital; therefore, IRR and MOIC information is not presented, as it is not meaningful.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year due to net inflows of $708.3 million, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions. Our real estate funds continue to deploy capital and generate strong returns with an 18.6% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and 13.5% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nThe performance information presented in this Fund Performance Information\u201d section is not indicative of the performance of our Class A Shares and is not necessarily indicative of the future results of any particular fund, including the accrued unrecognized amounts of incentive income. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our existing or future funds will achieve similar results. The timing and amount of incentive income generated from our funds are inherently uncertain. Incentive income is a function of investment performance and realizations of investments, which vary period-to-period based on market conditions and other factors. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. Incentive income recognized for any particular period is not a reliable indicator of incentive income that may be earned in subsequent periods.\nLonger-Term AUM and Accrued But Unrecognized Incentive Income ( ABURI\u201d)\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 68% of our AUM were subject to initial commitment periods of three years or longer, excluding AUM that had initial commitment periods of three years or longer and subsequently moved to shorter commitment periods at the end of their initial commitment period.

As of December 31, 2021, our ABURI was $226.9 million, up $98.6 million since the end of 2020. In 2021, $198.5 million of ABURI was generated driven by strong performance in our opportunistic credit funds primarily from certain open ended credit funds, which will largely not crystallize until after a multi-year period and last crystallized in 2020, and from Real Estate Fund III and IV, which are not expected to crystallize until closer to the end of their respective fund life. We recognized $99.8 million of incentive income from longer-term AUM in 2021, primarily from tax distributions from our Customized Credit Focused Platform and several of our real estate funds, which reduced our ABURI balance\nOur ABURI from longer-term AUM generally comprise the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. Multi-strategy ABURI is derived from clients in the three-year liquidity tranche, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year period.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. Opportunistic credit funds ABURI is derived from three sources:\n\u25e6Clients in the three-year and four-year liquidity tranches of an open-end opportunistic credit fund, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year or four-year period\n\u25e6Long dated closed-end opportunistic credit funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized during each fund's harvest period after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients\n\u25e6The Customized Credit Focused Platform, where incentive income other than tax distributions is recognized at the end of a multi-year term; previously crystallized on December 31, 2020\n\u2022Real estate funds. Real Estate ABURI is derived from long-dated real estate funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will start to be recognized following the completion of each fund's investment period as investments are realized and after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients.\nCertain ABURI amounts presented above will generally have compensation expense (on an Economic Income Basis) that will reduce the amount ultimately realized on a net basis. Compensation expense relating to ABURI from our real estate funds is generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized. Compensation expense relating to ABURI generated from our multi-strategy funds and opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are generated.\nUnderstanding Our Results\nRevenues\nOur operations historically have been financed primarily by cash flows generated by our business. Our principal sources of revenues are management fees and incentive income. For any given period, our revenues are influenced by the amount of our AUM, the investment performance of our funds and the timing of when we recognize incentive income for certain AUM as discussed below.\nThe ability of investors to contribute capital to and redeem capital from our funds causes our AUM to fluctuate from period to period. Fluctuations in AUM also result from our funds' investment performance. Both of these factors directly impact the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. For example, a $1.0 billion increase or decrease in AUM subject to a 1% management fee would generally increase or decrease annual management fees by $10.0 million. If profits, net of management fees, attributable to a fee-paying fund investor were $10.0 million in a given year, we generally would earn incentive income equal to $2.0 million, assuming a 20% incentive income rate, a one-year commitment period, no hurdle rate and no high-water marks from prior years.\nFor any given quarter, our revenues are influenced by the combination of AUM and the investment performance of our funds. For example, incentive income for the majority of our multi-strategy AUM is recognized in the fourth quarter each year, based on full year investment performance.\nManagement Fees. Management fees are generally calculated and paid to us on a quarterly basis in advance, based on the amount of AUM at the beginning of the quarter. Management fees are prorated for capital inflows and redemptions during the quarter. Accordingly, changes in our management fee revenues from quarter to quarter are driven by changes in the quarterly opening balances of AUM, the relative magnitude and timing of inflows and redemptions during the respective quarter, the impact of differing management fee rates charged on those inflows and redemptions, as well as the impact of the deferral of subordinated management fees from certain CLOs. See -Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d for information on our average management fee rate and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding management fees.\nIncentive Income. We earn incentive income based on the cumulative performance of our funds over a commitment period. We recognize incentive income when such amounts are probable of not significantly reversing. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding incentive income.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of interest income on investments in CLOs, cash equivalents and long-term U.S. government obligations, as well as subrental income. Interest income is recognized on an effective yield basis. Subrental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIncome of Consolidated Entities. Revenues recorded as income of consolidated entities consist primarily of fee and other income.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of salaries, employee benefits, payroll taxes, and discretionary and guaranteed cash bonus expenses. We generally recognize compensation and benefits expenses over the related service period. Due to multi-year crystallizations in our credit and real estate funds, we may recognize discretionary bonus expense as incentive is generated at the fund level but before the Company recognizes the related incentive income. For additional information on incentive income recognized at fund level but not yet recognized by us see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report for additional information. We generally pay our bonuses in January of the year following the year in which bonuses were accrued.\nOn an annual basis, compensation and benefits comprise a significant portion of total expenses, with discretionary cash bonuses generally comprising a significant portion of total compensation and benefits. We accrue minimum annual discretionary cash bonuses on a straight-line basis during the year. The total amount of discretionary cash bonuses ultimately recognized for the full year, which is determined in the fourth quarter of each year, could differ materially from the minimum amount accrued, as the total discretionary cash bonus is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the year.\nCompensation and benefits also include equity-based compensation expense, which is primarily in the form of RSUs granted to our independent board members, employees and executive managing directors, as well as RSAs, PSUs and Partner Equity Units granted to executive managing directors.\nWe also have profit-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees or executive managing directors are entitled to a share of incentive income that we earn primarily from our real estate funds. This incentive income is typically paid to us and then we pay a portion to the profit-sharing participant as investments held by these funds are realized. To the extent that the payments to the employees or executive managing directors are probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue these payments as compensation expense for GAAP purposes, which may occur prior to the recognition of the related incentive income.\nDeferred cash interests ( DCIs\u201d) are also granted to certain employees and executive managing directors as a form of compensation. DCIs reflect notional fund investments made by us on behalf of an employee or executive managing director. DCIs generally vest over a three-year period, subject to an employee's or executive managing director's continued service. Upon vesting, we pay the employee or executive managing director an amount in cash equal to the notional investment represented by the DCIs, as adjusted for notional fund performance. Except as otherwise provided in the relevant DCI plan or in an award agreement, in the event of a termination of the employee's or executive managing director's service, any portion of the DCIs that is unvested as of the date of termination will be forfeited.\nSculptor's compensation structure is designed to align the interests of our executive managing directors and employees with those of investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Our compensation structure focuses on both individual and firm-wide performance through bonus compensation in a combination of equity and deferred cash interests that vest over time.\nInterest Expense. Amounts included within interest expense relate primarily to indebtedness outstanding.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other. General, administrative and other expenses are comprised of professional services, occupancy and equipment, information processing and communications, recurring placement and related service fees, business\ndevelopment, insurance, impairment of right-of-use lease assets, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous expenses. Legal settlements and provisions are also included within general, administrative and other.\nExpenses of Consolidated Entities. Expenses recorded as expenses of consolidated entities consist of general, administrative and other miscellaneous expenses.\nOther (Loss) Income\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities represent gains (losses) from changes in fair value of warrants.\nChanges in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability. Changes in tax receivable agreement liability consists of changes in our estimate of the future payments related to the tax receivable agreement that result from changes in future income tax savings due to changes in tax rates. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nNet Losses on Retirement of Debt. Net losses on retirement of debt consist of net losses realized upon the retirement of any indebtedness outstanding, and include the write-off of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, as well as other fees incurred in connection with the retirement of debt.\nNet Gains on Investments. Net gains on investments primarily consist of realized and unrealized net gains and losses on investments in U.S. government obligations and investments in our funds, including CLOs and other funds we manage.\nNet (Losses) Gains of Consolidated Entities. Net (losses) gains of consolidated entities primarily consist of changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities related to our consolidated SPAC.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes consist of our provision for federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and foreign income taxes, including provisions for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the tax and GAAP bases. The computation of the provision requires certain estimates and significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the expected taxable income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions, permanent differences between the tax and GAAP bases and the likelihood of being able to fully utilize deferred income tax assets existing as of the end of the period.\nThe Sculptor Operating Partnerships are partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Registrant was a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the Corporate Classification Change on April 1, 2019. Prior to the Corporate Classification Change, only a portion of the income we earned was subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Following the Corporate Classification Change, generally all of the income allocated to the Registrant from the Sculptor Operating Group will be subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. See Note 14 for additional information regarding significant items impacting our income tax provision and effective tax rate.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by parties other than us and are primarily made up of Group A Units. Increases or decreases in net (loss) income attributable to the Group A Units are driven by the earnings of the Sculptor Operating Group. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our ownership interest in the Sculptor Operating Group.\nIn 2021, we consolidated our SPAC, wherein investors are able to redeem Class A shares issued by the SPAC. Allocations of earnings to these shares are reflected within net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the net income (loss) attributable to SPAC investors' interests in the SPAC is driven primarily by interest income generated on cash and cash equivalents, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of the SPAC and various expenses related to legal costs, business development and insurance. Additionally, the accretion\nof the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value is recorded within change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders Table 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,605) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(179,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders from the prior year.\nRevenues Table 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>616,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(304,527) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>626,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>897,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(270,952) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues in 2021 were $626.1 million, decreasing $271.0 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $31.2 million increase in management fees, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $24.0 million increase in multi-strategy funds due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase in opportunistic credit funds due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.4 million increase in Institutional Credit Strategies due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022Real Estate Funds. A $2.8 million decrease in real estate funds due to lower management fees from both Real Estate Fund III and Real Estate Fund II, and related co-investment vehicles, due to lower average AUM as realizations decreased overall fund size.\nSee -AUM and Fund Performance-Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d above for information regarding our average management fee rates.\n\u2022A $304.5 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $124.7 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $1.9 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\n\u2022A $4.3 million increase in income of consolidated entities due to increase in other fee income of our consolidated entities compared to the prior year period.\nExpenses Table 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>409,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,514) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110,977) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>551,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>662,568 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111,486) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenses in 2021 were $551.1 million, decreasing $111.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $111.0 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories.\n\u2022A $5.5 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balance as we repaid $224.4 million under the 2020 Term Loan and $19.9 million under a CLO Investment Loan in 2021.\n\u2022A $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses driven by various offsetting items, including a $25.9 million increase in bonus expense due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nNote that as our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\n\u25e6 The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $17.4 million decrease in equity-based compensation expense primarily due to: (i) a $13.4 million decrease in amounts related to Group E Units, as the remaining units are being amortized on an accelerated basis (i.e., each tranche is being amortized over its respective service period), resulting in decreasing expenses in each subsequent vesting year on these awards; and (ii) an $8.2 million decrease in amounts related to Group P Units as a result of the related service period ending during 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in RSU amortization primarily due to acceleration of the compensation cost as a result of separation-related compensation for a departing executive. In addition, salaries and benefits decreased by $6.3 million, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022A $2.8 million increase in expense of consolidated entities due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of the consolidated entities from the prior year period.\nOther Loss Table 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27,460) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,548) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,912) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in tax receivable agreement liability </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,238) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,554) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,684) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses on retirement of debt </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,011) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net losses of consolidated entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other (Loss) Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55,840) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(51,338) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal other loss in 2021 was $55.8 million, increasing $51.3 million, which resulted from the following:\n\u2022Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are the result of an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase our Class A Shares that were issued in connection with the 2020 Credit Agreement. The change was primarily due to the increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends, and the change in risk-free rate from the issuance date of the warrants to December 31, 2021. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details on warrants valuation inputs.\n\u2022Changes in tax receivable agreement liability. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are both a result of changes in projected future tax rates impacting the anticipated liability under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Net losses on retirement of debt. The amount in 2021 was primarily related to the $224.4 million prepayment of amounts outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million repayment of a CLO Investment Loan, while the amount in 2020 was primarily related to the $200.0 million and $45.0 million full repayments of amounts outstanding under the Debt Securities and 2018 Term Loan, respectively. The related losses on retirement of debt were comprised of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs that were proportionately written-off in connection with these repayments.\n\u2022Net gains on investments. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 both represent investment income on our equity method investments. In 2021, risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations both generated income, compared to losses in the prior year. Investment income increased by $926 thousand, primarily due to higher gains from risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations, partially offset by lower gains on our equity method investments, primarily due to lower gains from our multi-strategy fund investments.\nIncome Taxes Table 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,272 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61,567) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased by $61.6 million.

During the Distribution Holiday, net income earned by any Sculptor Operating Partnership is allocated 100% to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc., while losses are allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. as described in Note 4.\nIn 2021, Sculptor Capital LP, which earns most of our management fees and incurs most of our operating expenses, generated a smaller loss than in the prior year period, as operating expenses were lower and management fees were higher in 2021 compared to 2020. Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP, along with Sculptor Capital Advisors LP, earn most of our incentive income. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors LP generated losses that were allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP generated net income, and therefore we allocated 100% of its income to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. Income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to entities we consolidated in 2021.\nChange in Redemption Value of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Preferred Units\nThe following table presents the change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units: Table 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,924) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,952) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,972) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2021 was a loss of $25.9 million, increasing by $19.0 million from prior year. The amount in 2021 represents the accretion to redemption value of the Class A Shares related to our consolidated SPAC, while the amount in 2020 relates to adjustments to the redemption value of the Preferred Units, which were redeemed in full in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nEconomic Income Analysis\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on an Economic Income\u201d basis. Economic Income excludes the adjustments described below that are required for presentation of our results on a GAAP basis, but that management does not consider when evaluating operating performance in any given period. Management uses Economic Income as the basis on which it evaluates our financial performance and makes resource allocation and other operating decisions. Management considers it important that investors review the same operating information that it uses.\nEconomic Income is a measure of pre-tax operating performance that excludes the following from our results on a GAAP basis:\n\u2022Income allocations to our executive managing directors on their direct interests in the Sculptor Operating Group. Management reviews operating performance at the Sculptor Operating Group level, where our operations are performed, prior to making any income allocations.\n\u2022Equity-based compensation expenses, net of cash settled RSUs, depreciation and amortization expenses, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, net losses on retirement of debt, gains and losses on fixed assets, and gains and losses on investments in funds as management does not consider these items to be reflective of operating performance. The fair value of RSUs that are settled in cash to employees or executive managing directors, where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is not certain at the time of the grant, is included as an expense at the time of settlement. Where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is certain on the grant date, the expense is recognized during the performance period to which the award relates. Further, impairment of right-of-use lease assets is excluded from Economic Income at the time the impairment is recognized for GAAP and the impact is then amortized over the lease term for Economic Income. Additionally, rent expense is offset by subrental income as management evaluates rent expenses on a net basis.\n\u2022Amounts related to non-cash interest expense accretion on debt. The 2020 Term Loan and the Debt Securities were each recognized at a significant discount, as proceeds from each borrowing were allocated to warrant liabilities and the 2019 Preferred Units, respectively, resulting in non-cash accretion to par over time through interest expense for GAAP. Management excludes these non-cash expenses from Economic Income, as it does not consider them to be reflective of our economic borrowing costs.\n\u2022Amounts related to the consolidated entities, including the related eliminations of management fees and incentive income, as management reviews the total amount of management fees and incentive income earned in relation to total AUM and fund performance.\nIn addition, expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\nAs a result of the adjustments described above, as well as an adjustment to present management fees net of recurring placement and related service fees (rather than considering these fees an expense), management fees, incentive income, other revenues, compensation and benefits, interest expense, general, administrative and other expenses and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests as presented on an Economic Income basis are also non-GAAP measures.\nFor reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the respective GAAP measures, please see -Economic Income Reconciliations\u201d at the end of this MD&A.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to our GAAP net income allocated to Class A Shareholders or cash flow from operations, or as indicative of liquidity or the cash available to fund operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP)\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(186,740) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Economic Income from the prior year.\nEconomic Income Revenues (Non-GAAP) Table 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income Basis </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>280,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>616,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(302,827) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,822) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Economic Income Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>876,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(275,209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Income revenues in 2021 were $601.0 million, decreasing $275.2 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $30.4 million increase in management fees, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $20.4 million increase due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.8 million increase due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022A $302.8 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $123.0 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $2.8 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\nEconomic Income Expenses (Non-GAAP) Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic Income Basis </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>389,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>349,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,918 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,601) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and other expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(125,776) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Economic Income Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>481,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>570,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(88,468) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic Income expenses in 2021 were $481.7 million, decreasing $88.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $125.8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories, including reduction in occupancy expense due to a sublease, as we offset rental expense with subrental income for Economic Income.\n\u2022A $39.9 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses primarily driven by a $46.2 million increase in bonus expense, primarily due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6In addition, we recognized a significant amount of incentive income over the first three quarters with limited impact to bonus expense. Bonus expense related to this incentive income was expensed in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, which shifted attributable earnings into these quarters.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement, and a $32.2 million charge related to the issuance of certain cash-settled equity awards granted as part of 2021 bonuses, in place of RSUs, which were largely one-time in nature. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nAs our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\nNote that expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\n\u25e6 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred cash compensation grants. The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in headcount is expected to be temporary.\n\u2022A $2.6 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to interest no longer accruing on the Debt Securities or 2018 Term Loan, as these were repaid in full in the fourth quarter of 2020 in connection with the closing of the 2020 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by interest accruals on the 2020 Term Loan.\nFor the discussion of results of Economic Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Economic Income Analysis\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThe working capital needs of our business have historically been met, and we anticipate will continue to be met, through cash generated from management fees and incentive income earned from our funds.\nWe ended the year with $170.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $205.4 million of longer-term U.S. government obligations (Treasury bills) and $193.6 million of management fees and incentive income receivable (the majority of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2022). We also have access to an additional $25.0 million through our undrawn 2020 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan, leaving a balance of $95.0 million. In September 2021, we subleased a portion of our New York City office space. As a result of the sublease, we expect to save $14.3 million of rent costs through the lease maturity in 2029. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares, please see -Liquidity of Consolidated SPAC\u201d included in this annual report for additional information regarding SPACs.\nBased on management's experience and our current level of AUM, we believe that our current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from management fees will be sufficient to meet our anticipated fixed operating expenses (as defined below) and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For our longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund our fixed operating expenses through management fees and to fund discretionary cash bonuses and the repayment of our financing arrangements through a combination of management fees and incentive income. We may also decide to meet these requirements by issuing additional debt, equity or other securities.\nOver the long term, we believe we will continue to grow our AUM, including longer-term fee generating capital, and sustain positive investment performance in our funds, which will reflect positively on our revenue streams strengthening the balance sheet and providing the firm with stability to cover our long-term liquidity requirements.\nTo maintain maximum flexibility to meet demands and opportunities both in the short and long term, and subject to existing contractual arrangements, we may want to use cash on hand, issue additional equity or borrow additional funds to:\n\u2022Support the future growth in our business.\n\u2022Create new or enhance existing products and investment platforms.\n\u2022Repay amounts due under our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\n\u2022Repurchase Class A Shares or Sculptor Operating Group Units.\n\u2022Pursue new investment opportunities.\n\u2022Develop new distribution channels.\n\u2022Pay dividends.\nRecent Developments - Share Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The repurchase program has no expiration date. We may purchase shares on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or through the use of other techniques such as accelerated share repurchases. The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to our discretion based upon market conditions and other opportunities that we may have for the use or investment of our cash balances. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nLiquidity Needs\nOver the next 12 months, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to:\n\u2022Pay our operating expenses.\n\u2022Pay interest and principal on our financing arrangements.\n\u2022Provide capital to facilitate the growth of our business, including making risk retention investments in CLOs managed by us that are subject to EU and UK risk retention rules and fund capital commitments to our funds.\n\u2022Pay income taxes, RSU tax withholding obligations and amounts due under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy.\nOperating Expenses\nWe generally rely on management fees to cover our fixed\u201d operating expenses, which we define as salaries, benefits, a minimum discretionary bonus and general, administrative and other expenses, including upcoming lease payments as presented in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, incurred in the ordinary course of business. No assurances can be given that our management fees will be sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses in future periods. To the extent our management fees do not cover our fixed operating expenses, as well as to fund any other liabilities, we would rely on cash on hand and incentive income to cover any shortfall. We cannot predict the amount of incentive income, if any, that we may earn in any given year. Total annual revenues, which are heavily influenced by the amount of incentive income we earn, historically have been sufficient to fund both our fixed operating expenses and all of our other working capital needs, including annual discretionary cash bonuses. These cash bonuses, which historically have comprised our largest cash operating expense, are variable such that in any year where total annual revenues are greater or less than the prior year, cash bonuses may be adjusted accordingly. Our ability to scale our largest cash operating expense to our total annual revenues helps us manage our cash flow and liquidity position from year to year.\nHistorically, we have determined the amount of discretionary cash bonuses during the fourth quarter of each year, based on our total annual revenues and fund performance. We have historically funded these amounts through fourth quarter management fees and incentive income crystallized on December 31, which represents the majority of the incentive income we typically earn each year. Related to performance on longer-term AUM, we accrue bonus expense on ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense in the current year period. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods. In addition, to the extent our funds generate incentive income in the fourth quarter, we may elect to increase the amount of cash bonuses paid to employees over the amount already accrued throughout the year, with any incremental amounts recognized as expense in the fourth quarter. Although we cannot predict the amount, if any, of incentive income we may earn, we are able to regularly monitor expected management fees and we believe that we will be able to adjust our expense infrastructure, including discretionary cash bonuses, as needed to meet the requirements of our business and in order to maintain positive operating cash flows. Nevertheless, if we generate insufficient cash flows from operations to meet our short-term liquidity needs, we may have to borrow funds or sell assets, subject to existing contractual arrangements.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe may use cash on hand to pay interest and principal due on our financing arrangements, including debt obligations and repurchase agreements, prior to their respective maturity or due dates, which would reduce amounts available to distribute to our Class A Shareholders. We may also refinance all or a portion of any borrowings outstanding on or prior to their respective maturity dates. For any amounts unpaid as of a maturity or due date, we will be required to repay the remaining balance by using cash on hand, refinancing the remaining balance by incurring new debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or by issuing equity or other securities, which would dilute existing shareholders. See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for details on our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\nCLO Risk Retention Investments\nIn order to meet risk retention requirements for certain of the CLOs we manage, we use a combination of cash on hand, as well as financing under the CLO Investments Loans and repurchase agreements to fund our 5% risk retention investments. We expect to continue relying on a combination of cash on hand and financing to fund future CLO risk retention investments. Payments of interest and principal on these borrowings are generally due at such time interest and principal payments are received\non our risk retention investments in the related CLOs; therefore, our CLO risk retention investments and related financings generally have a net positive impact on our liquidity at each CLO interest and principal payment date.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have made, and may in the future be required to make, payments under the tax receivable agreement that we entered into with our executive managing directors and Ziff Investors Partnership, L.P. II and certain of its affiliates and control persons (the Ziffs\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we generate sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization resulting from the increase in tax basis of certain Sculptor Operating Group assets, we expected to pay our executive managing directors and the Ziffs approximately $195.8 million. Future cash savings and related payments to our executive managing directors under the tax receivable agreement in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement are anticipated to increase the tax basis adjustment and, consequently, result in increasing annual amortization deductions in the taxable years of and after such increases to the original basis adjustments, and potentially will give rise to increasing tax savings with respect to such years and correspondingly increasing payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement is an obligation of Sculptor Corp, and any other corporate taxpaying entities that hold Group B Units, and not of the Sculptor Operating Group. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent the Sculptor Operating Group does not distribute cash to Sculptor Corp in an amount sufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets resulting from an exchange or from payments under the tax receivable agreement, as well as the amortization thereof and the timing and amount of payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary based upon a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022The amount and timing of our income will impact the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement. To the extent that we do not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the amortization deductions available as a result of the increased tax basis in the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets, payments required under the tax receivable agreement would be reduced.\n\u2022The price of our Class A Shares at the time of any exchange will determine the actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets resulting from such exchange; payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from future exchanges, if any, will be dependent in part upon such actual increase in tax basis.\n\u2022The composition of the Sculptor Operating Group assets at the time of any exchange will determine the extent to which we may benefit from amortizing the increased tax basis in such assets and thus will impact the amount of future payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from any future exchanges.\n\u2022The extent to which future exchanges are taxable will impact the extent to which we will receive an increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets as a result of such exchanges, and thus will impact the benefit derived by us and the resulting payments, if any, to be made under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022The tax rates in effect at the time any potential tax savings are realized, which would affect the amount of any future payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nDepending upon the outcome of these factors, payments that we may be obligated to make to our current and former executive managing directors and the Ziffs under the tax receivable agreement in respect of exchanges could be substantial. In light of the numerous factors affecting our obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are not reasonably ascertainable.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe table below presents the cash dividends paid on our Class A Shares in 2021 and 2020. We did not declare a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021 in respect of earnings for the fourth quarter. We did not declare a dividend in the first three quarters of 2020 in respect of earnings for the first three quarters. Dividends are generally declared and paid in the quarter following the quarter to which they relate. For example, the dividend paid on November 22, 2021 was in respect of earnings for the third quarter of 2021. We paid no related cash distributions to our executive managing directors on their Sculptor Operating Group Units in the respective periods as a result of the Distribution Holiday.

During the Distribution Holiday, dividends may continue to be paid on our Class A Shares. As of December 31, 2021, we have generated a total of $469.7 million of Distribution Holiday Economic Income, compared to the target of $600.0 million.\nDistribution Holiday Economic Income is the cumulative amount of Economic Income earned since October 1, 2018, less any dividends paid to Class A Shareholders or on the now-retired Preferred Units. Distribution Holiday Economic Income is a non-GAAP measure that is defined in the agreements of limited partnership of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships and is being presented to provide an update on the progress made toward the $600.0 million target required to exit the Distribution Holiday. Please see -Distribution Holiday Economic Income Reconciliation\u201d for a reconciliation of Distribution Holiday Economic Income to net income attributable to Class A Shareholders.\nDuring the Distribution Holiday, we expect to pay dividends on our Class A Shares annually in an aggregate amount equal to not less than 20% or greater than 30% of our annual Economic Income less an estimate of payments under the tax receivable agreement, and income taxes related to the earnings for the periods; provided, that, if the minimum amount of dividends eligible to be made hereunder would be $1.00 or less per Class A Share, then up to $1.00 per Class A Share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any equity dividend, equity split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Class A Shares). During the Distribution Holiday, (i) we will only make distributions with respect to Group B Units, (ii) the performance thresholds of Group P Units and PSUs shall be adjusted to take into account performance and distributions during such period, and (iii) RSUs will continue to receive dividend equivalents in respect of dividends or distributions paid on the Class A Shares. For certain executive managing directors, distributions on RSUs, as well as distributions counted in determining whether market performance conditions of Group P Units and PSUs are met, are limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.00 per Group P Unit, PSU or RSU, as applicable, cumulatively during the Distribution Holiday. Following the termination of the Distribution Holiday, Group A Units and Group E Units (whether vested or unvested) shall receive distributions even if such units have not been booked-up. See Note 13 for additional information\nThe declaration and payment of any distribution may be subject to legal, contractual or other restrictions. For example, as a Delaware corporation, the Registrant's Board may only declare and pay dividends either out of its surplus (as defined in Delaware General Corporation Law) or in case there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Our cash needs and payment obligations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and we may have material unexpected expenses in any period. This may cause amounts available for distribution to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter or may reduce or eliminate such amounts.\nAdditionally, RSUs outstanding accrue dividend equivalents equal to the dividend amounts paid on our Class A Shares. To date, these dividend equivalents have been awarded in the form of additional RSUs, which accrue additional dividend equivalents. The dividend equivalents will only be paid if the related RSUs vest and will be settled at the same time as the underlying RSUs. Our Board of Directors has the right to determine whether the RSUs and any related dividend equivalents will be settled in Class A Shares or in cash. We currently withhold shares to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to vested RSUs and dividend equivalents held by our employees, which results in the use of cash from operations or borrowings to satisfy these tax-withholding payments.\nHistorically, when we have paid dividends on our Class A Shares, we also made distributions to our executive managing directors on their interests in the Sculptor Operating Group, subject to the terms of the limited partnership agreements of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships; however, as part of the Recapitalization, the Sculptor Operating Partnerships initiated the Distribution Holiday. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding the Distribution Holiday.\nOur cash distribution policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to our liquidity. Although we expect to pay distributions according to our policy, we may not make distributions according to our policy, or at all, if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the distribution. Furthermore, by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our obligations, operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to execute our business and growth strategy to the extent intended.\nRisks to Our Liquidity\nNet capital outflows from our multi-strategy funds over the last several years caused our management fees to decline for a period of time. While outflows have stabilized over the last couple of quarters and we continuously make every effort to scale our operations so that management fees are sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses, our management fees may not always cover these expenses. Additionally, in the event that a future contingent liability were to arise that exceeded our liquidity resources, we would need to rely on new sources of liquidity such as issuing additional equity or borrowing additional funds.\nAny new borrowing arrangement that we may enter into may have covenants that impose additional limitations on us, including with respect to making distributions, entering into business transactions or other matters, and may result in increased interest expense. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations on terms that are favorable to us, our business may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that we will be able to issue new notes, enter into new credit facilities or issue equity or other securities in the future on attractive terms or at all.\nAdverse market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk that our management fees and incentive income may decline if net outflows increase or as a result of performance-related depreciation in our funds. Lower revenues and other factors may make it more difficult or costly to raise or borrow additional funds, and excessive borrowing costs or other significant market barriers may limit or prevent us from maximizing our growth potential and flexibility. We have also evaluated our financing arrangements in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure compliance with debt covenants. Through the date of this filing, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants and expect to continue to be in compliance in the near term. Our ability to access financial markets, should it be necessary, may be limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur CLO risk retention financing arrangements are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants, but are subject to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type and also include terms that require our continued involvement with the CLOs. In addition to customary events of default included in financing arrangements of this type, the CLO Investments Loans may be accelerated to the extent there is an event of default ( EOD\u201d) at the CLO level. Prior to the relevant CLO's maturity date, this would include certain material covenant breaches, regulatory and insolvency events for the relevant CLO issuer, as well as a payment default where the relevant CLO is unable to make interest payments on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes issued by the CLO. For the repurchase agreements, in addition to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type, there are margin requirements that may cause us to post additional cash collateral; however, this is only triggered in the event of an EOD at the CLO level. Currently, we do not view any of the customary or CLO level EODs for these types of financing arrangements as a material risk. In particular, an EOD related to an\ninterest payment default on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes of the type of cash flow CLOs that we manage has been unprecedented even during the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009.\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark immediately after December 31, 2021, for sterling, euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023, the remaining U.S. Dollar settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had direct exposure to U.S. Dollar LIBOR-linked interest rate settings through its 2020 Credit Agreement, and certain CLO Investments and associated CLO Investment Loans.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we formed an internal LIBOR Transition Working Group to help effectuate an orderly transition from LIBOR. To address LIBOR cessation, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides for an agreed upon methodology to establish a new floating rate reference plus new applicable spreads. Each of the Company's CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans that reference U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will also be transitioned to an alternative reference rate. This transition will either be carried out through hardwired replacement mechanisms and/or amendment procedures in the existing governing documents for such CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans or as a result of New York statutory process (the New York LIBOR Legislation\u201d) which was signed into law on April 6, 2021. Additionally, the firm is pursuing several technology initiatives to ensure that firm-wide accounting and master data systems are equipped to handle evolving market conventions associated with regulatory recommended reference rates. We expect to complete these technology initiatives in the first half of 2022 and will continue to monitor for any future changes in market standards. Our senior management has oversight of the Company's transition efforts, and periodic updates are provided to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For the face value of instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition that we hold on our books see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our credit arrangements and our collateralized loan obligation transactions\u201d in this annual report for additional information.\nOur Funds' Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur funds have access to liquidity from our prime brokers and other counterparties. Additionally, our funds may have committed facilities in addition to regular financing from our counterparties. These sources of liquidity provide our funds with additional financing resources, allowing them to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.\nOur funds' current liquidity position could be adversely impacted by any substantial, unanticipated investor redemptions from our funds that are made within a short time period. As discussed above in -AUM and Fund Performance,\u201d capital contributions from investors in our multi-strategy and open-end opportunistic credit funds generally are subject to initial lock-up periods of one to three years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days' prior written notice. These lock-ups and redemption notice periods help us to manage our liquidity position. Investors in our other funds are generally not allowed to redeem until the end of the life of the fund.\nWe also follow a rigorous risk management process and regularly monitor the liquidity of our funds' portfolios in relation to economic and market factors and the timing of potential investor redemptions. As a result of this process, we may determine to reduce exposure or increase the liquidity of our funds' portfolios at any time, whether in response to global economic and market conditions, redemption requests or otherwise. For these reasons, we believe we will be well prepared to address market conditions and redemption requests, as well as any other events, with limited impact on our funds' liquidity position. Nevertheless, significant redemptions made during a single quarter could adversely affect our funds' liquidity position, as we may meet redemptions by using our funds' available cash or selling assets (possibly at a loss). Such actions would result in lower AUM, which would reduce the amount of management fees and incentive income we may earn. Our funds could also meet redemption requests by increasing leverage, provided we are able to obtain financing on reasonable terms, if at all. We believe our funds have sufficient liquidity to meet any anticipated redemptions for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity of Consolidated SPAC\nThe restricted cash and cash equivalents of SPAC are held in a trust account and include money market funds consisting of U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities of 60 days or less when purchased, that were purchased with funds raised through\nthe initial public offering of the consolidated entity. The $234.6 million in funds as of December 31, 2021, are restricted for use and may only be used for purposes of completing an initial business combination or redemption of public shares as set forth in the SPAC trust agreement.\nCash Flows Analysis\nOperating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $476.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Our net cash flows from operating activities are generally comprised of current-year management fees, the collection of incentive income earned during the fourth quarter of the previous year, interest income collected on our investments in CLO's, less cash used for operating expenses, including interest paid on our debt obligations.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased from the prior year period due to higher year-end incentive income earned in 2020 than in 2019, a large portion of the 2020 incentive was collected in the beginning of 2021, as compared to year-end incentive income earned in 2019, a large portion of which was collected in the beginning of 2020. Additionally, in 2021 we collected more incentive income from our real estate funds compared to 2020. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by higher discretionary bonuses in 2020, which were paid in the first quarter of 2021, as compared to discretionary bonuses in 2019, which were paid in the first quarter of 2020.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(190.3) million, and $15.4 million, respectively. Investing cash outflows in 2021 and 2020 primarily related to purchases of U.S. government obligations and investments made in our funds, partially offset by maturities and sales of U.S. government obligations.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(59.8) million, and $(82.7) million, respectively. Net cash from financing activities is generally comprised of dividends paid to our Class A Shareholders, borrowings and repayments related to our debt obligations, and proceeds from repurchase agreements used to finance risk retention investments in our CLOs. Distributions to our executive managing directors on their Group A Units (prior to the Distribution Holiday), are also included in net cash from financing activities. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares. These financing-related cash flows are of the consolidated entity and do not directly impact the cash flows related to our Class A Shareholders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million CLO Investment Loan. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the Debt Securities and the 2018 Term Loan, redeemed in full the 2019 Preferred Units, and borrowed $320.0 million under the 2020 Credit Agreement. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into $45.9 million of repurchase agreements to finance or refinance risk retention investments in our European CLOs.\nWe paid dividends of $84.2 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to dividends of $11.6 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the only dividend paid was in respect of the fourth quarter of 2019, which was paid on March 3, 2020. No distributions were made to our executive managing directors in the years ended December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020, as a result of the Distribution Holiday.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that require us to make significant judgments, estimates or assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements or the notes thereto. We base our judgments, estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and prudent. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our accounting policies. Set forth below is a summary of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nFair Value of Investments\nThe valuation of investments held by our funds is the most critical estimate made by management impacting our results. Pursuant to specialized accounting for investment companies under GAAP, investments held by the funds are carried at their\nestimated fair values. The valuation of investments held by our funds has a significant impact on our results, as our management fees and incentive income are generally determined based on the fair value of these investments.\nGAAP prioritizes the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of assets and liabilities and the specific characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities with readily available, actively quoted prices (Level I) or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices (Level II) generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value than those measured using pricing inputs that are unobservable in the market (Level III). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 40% within Level I; approximately 41% within Level II; and approximately 19% within Level III. As of December 31, 2020, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 35% within Level I; approximately 48% within Level II; and approximately 17% within Level III. The percentage of our funds' assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy will fluctuate based on the investments made at any given time and such fluctuations could be significant. A portion of our funds' Level III assets relate to Special Investments or other investments on which we do not earn any incentive income until such investments are sold or otherwise realized. Upon the sale or realization event of these assets, any realized profits are included in the calculation of incentive income for such year. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of our funds' Level III assets may not have any relation to the amount of incentive income actually earned with respect to such assets.\nValuation of Investments. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The fair value of our funds' investments is based on observable market prices when available. We, as the investment manager of our funds, determine the fair value of investments that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The methods and procedures to value these investments may include the following: performing comparisons with prices of comparable or similar securities; obtaining valuation-related information from the issuers; calculating the present value of future cash flows; assessing other analytical data and information relating to the investment that is an indication of value; obtaining information provided by third parties; and evaluating financial information provided by the management of these investments.\nSignificant judgment and estimation go into the assumptions that drive our valuation methodologies and procedures for assets that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The valuation of investments can be more difficult when severe economic and market shocks occur. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of such a shock. The actual amounts ultimately realized could differ materially from the values estimated based on the use of these methodologies. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected could result in losses at the fund level and a decline in future management fees and incentive income. Such situations may also negatively impact fund investor perception of our valuation policies and procedures, which could result in redemptions and difficulties in raising additional capital.\nWe have established an internal control infrastructure over the valuation of financial instruments that includes ongoing oversight by our Valuation Controls Group and Valuation Committee, as well as periodic audits by our Internal Audit function. These management control functions are segregated from the trading and investing functions.\nThe Valuation Committee is responsible for establishing the valuation policy and monitors compliance with the policy, ensuring that all of the funds' investments reflect fair value, as well as providing oversight of the valuation process. The valuation policy includes, but is not limited to the following: determining the pricing sources used to value specific investment classes; the selection of independent pricing services; performing due diligence of independent pricing services; and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy. The Valuation Committee reviews a variety of reports on a monthly basis, which include the following: summaries of the sources used to determine the value of the funds' investments; summaries of the fair value hierarchy of the funds' investments; methodology changes and variance reports that compare the values of investments to\nindependent pricing services. The Valuation Committee is independent from the investment professionals and may obtain input from investment professionals for consideration in carrying out its responsibilities.\nThe Valuation Committee has assigned the responsibility of performing price verification and related quality controls in accordance with the valuation policy to the Valuation Controls Group. The Valuation Controls Group's other responsibilities include the following: overseeing the collection and evaluation of counterparty prices, broker-dealer quotations, exchange prices and pricing information provided by independent pricing services. Additionally, the Valuation Controls Group is responsible for performing back testing by comparing prices observed in executed transactions to valuations provided by independent pricing service providers on a monthly basis; performing stale pricing analysis on a monthly basis; performing due diligence reviews on independent pricing services on an annual basis; and recommending changes in valuation policies to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Controls Group also verifies that indicative broker quotations used to value certain investments are representative of fair value through procedures such as comparison to independent pricing services, back testing procedures, review of stale pricing reports and performance of other due diligence procedures as may be deemed necessary.\nInvestment professionals and members of the Valuation Controls Group review a daily profit and loss report, as well as other periodic reports that analyze the profit and loss and related asset class exposure of the funds' investments.\nThe Internal Audit function employs a risk-based program of audit coverage that is designed to provide an assessment of the design and effectiveness of controls over our operations, regulatory compliance, valuation of financial instruments and reporting. Additionally, the Internal Audit function meets periodically with management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to evaluate and provide guidance on the existing risk framework and control environment assessments.\nFor information regarding the impact that the fair value measurement of AUM has on our results, please see Part II-", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds.\nOverview\nGeneral\n2021 marked a new chapter at Sculptor as we continued to execute on our business plan. We began this chapter with a strong foundation after focusing over the last few years on building business stability. The following accomplishments were key to evolving the business to where it stands today, with sustained investment performance, improved investor flows and a stronger balance sheet.\nFirst, we continued to deliver sustained investment performance across our funds for our clients over most measurable time horizons. Sculptor Master Fund was up 5.0% net for full year 2021 and Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund and Customized Credit Focused Platform were up 17.0% and 17.2% net, respectively, for the full year 2021.\nSecond, our funds have stabilized their asset base and we have seen progress in our flows. This began by normalizing redemption levels and then building the pipeline for flows. Gross inflows in the multi-strategy funds were 11.3% of beginning AUM for 2021. This improvement, coupled with normalized redemption rates, led to the first year of positive net flows into the multi-strategy funds since 2014. Increases in our asset base from flows and fund performance have driven the rise in our management fee earnings. We have also been able to evolve our product mix from shorter-duration to longer-duration products. Our longer-term AUM has increased to 68% in 2021 from 26% in 2013. As a result, our asset base has increased longevity, creating consistency in our management fees.\nThird, we have strengthened our balance sheet. We refinanced our liabilities at the end of 2020 and have since paid down $224 million of term debt this year, the lowest level of debt since our IPO in 2007\nGiven the above, we believe the fundamentals driving our earnings are sound and growing. Our management fees are up $31 million year-over-year. Our earnings, excluding the benefit of incentive income and the associated variable bonus expense, which includes management fees less fixed expenses (salaries and benefits, minimum discretionary bonus, and general, administrative, and other expenses) has gone from negative to positive over the last two years. This is a function of growing management fees while cutting or maintaining fixed expenses noted above.\nWhile the business fundamentals are sound, the earnings for any given year can have volatility due to annual performance or incentive fee recognition timing. Over time, we created greater consistency in management fees as our longer-term AUM grew. With that also comes volatility in overall earnings due to the impact of longer-term AUM on incentive fee recognition and associated variable bonus expense timing. There is a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue our discretionary bonus expense, which is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the full calendar year. Incentive income for this longer-term AUM is typically recognized near the end of a multi-year period, which can create year-over-year volatility in incentive income.\nGiven the above, when we evaluate our business, we look to the underlying earnings drivers of the organization which will drive future returns to shareholders. These key indicators include strong fund performance and incremental net flows compounding our asset base, continuing to be cognizant of our cost framework, and growing and utilizing our balance sheet to invest in the growth of the business.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, we continued to focus on the health and well-being of our employees and the uninterrupted service to investors in our funds and our shareholders. Where appropriate or recommended under local\ngovernment guidelines, we successfully continued to execute our business continuity plan and continued operating a work from home model, with certain employees returning to the office with safety protocols in place consistent with government guidelines. We rely significantly on the effectiveness of our information technology infrastructure to continue our operations and to continue to maintain appropriate controls over operations, treasury function, accounting and financial reporting.\nDue to the uncertainty over the timing and extent of any possible global economic recovery, we cannot readily estimate or determine the effects that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on our future business and financial results, as well as on our liquidity and capital resources. Please see the COVID-19 commentary included throughout this MD&A, including -Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this annual report for additional information.\nOverview of Our Financial Results\nWe reported GAAP net loss of $8.6 million in 2021, compared to net income of $170.7 million in 2020. This decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the related discretionary bonus expense, resulting in lower incentive income and higher bonus expense in 2021 than in the prior year period, as discussed in the general overview section above. We recognized lower incentive income in 2021 than in the prior year period driven by more modest performance in our multi-strategy funds in the current year and an outsized crystallization of incentive income as a result of a multi-year crystallizations in our credit business in the prior year. The higher bonus expense in the current year was primarily driven by strong fund performance in our opportunistic credit funds and a new senior management compensation arrangement. Due to the timing that can impact our business, we recommend evaluating our results over a multi-year period and in connection with our ABURI disclosure.\n2021 benefited from improvement in our core earnings drivers compared to the prior year period. Management fees were higher as a result of higher AUM, and general, administrative and other expenses decreased as a result of legal provisions incurred in the prior year period. The net loss in 2021 was also offset by lower income tax expense, lower equity-based compensation and salaries and benefits expenses, and lower interest expense.\nThese improvements were offset by higher losses on early retirement of debt as we prepaid $224.4 million of our 2020 Term Loan in 2021, strengthening our balance sheet, and by higher loss from the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities, primarily due to an increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends paid during the year, and the change in risk-free rate.\nAdditionally impacting our net loss attributable to Class A Shareholders was an adjustment to the redemption value of the Class A Shares of Sculptor Acquisition Corporation I ( SAC I\u201d), our consolidated SPAC, that decreased net income attributable to our Class A Shareholders in 2021 by $25.9 million. In 2020, an adjustment of $7.0 million to the redemption value of the Preferred Units related to the accrual of distributions on the units decreased net income attributable to Class A Shareholders. Please see -Results of Operations\u201d for detailed discussion of the drivers of our results.\nEconomic Income was $119.4 million in 2021, compared to $306.1 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the timing difference between recognition of incentive income from funds and the related discretionary bonus expense discussed above, partially offset by lower general, administrative and other expenses due to legal provisions incurred in 2020, higher management fees, lower salaries and benefits expense, and lower interest expense.\nEconomic Income is a non-GAAP measure. For additional information regarding non-GAAP measures, as well as for a discussion of the drivers of the year-over-year change in Economic Income, please see -Economic Income Analysis.\u201d\nOverview of AUM and Fund Performance\nAUM totaled $38.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. Longer-term AUM were $25.8 billion, comprising 68% of our total AUM as of December 31, 2021.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds totaled $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year. This change was driven by performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. 2021 marked the first time our multi-strategy fund had positive net inflows since 2014.\nSculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities. Please see -AUM and Fund Performance-Multi-Strategy Funds\u201d for additional information regarding the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund.\nAUM in our dedicated credit products totaled $22.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $417.3 million, or 2%, year-over-year. AUM in our opportunistic credit funds totaled $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, remaining relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows primarily in our open-end opportunistic credit funds, and $38.5 million of distributions, primarily in our closed-end opportunistic credit funds.\nFor the full year 2021, Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. Our Customized Credit Focused Platform, which invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate, generated a gross return of 21.8% and a net return of 17.2% year-to-date through December 31, 2021. In 2021, the funds' returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nAUM in Institutional Credit Strategies totaled $16.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $354.6 million, or 2%, year-over-year. CLO issuance remained active during the year, with the increase in AUM driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our CLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year primarily due to $708.3 million of net inflows driven by the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions.\nSince inception through December 31, 2021, the gross internal rate of return ( IRR\u201d) was 28.0% and 18.6% net for Sculptor Real Estate Fund III (for which the investment period ended in September 2019). Since inception through December 31, 2021, the gross IRR was 18.6% and 13.5% net for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nManaging Business Performance\nOur financial results are primarily driven by the combination of our AUM and the investment performance of our funds. Both of these factors directly affect the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. Growth in AUM due to capital placed with us by investors in our funds and positive investment performance of our funds drive growth in our revenues and earnings. Conversely, poor investment performance slows our growth by decreasing our AUM and increasing the potential for redemptions from our funds, which would have a negative effect on our revenues and earnings.\nWe typically accept capital from new and existing investors in our multi-strategy and certain open-end opportunistic credit funds on a monthly basis on the first day of each month. Investors in these funds (other than with respect to capital invested in Special Investments) typically have the right to redeem their interests in a fund following an initial lock-up period of one to four years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days prior written notice. The lock-up requirements for our funds may generally be waived or modified at the sole discretion of each funds' general partner or board of directors, as applicable.\nWith respect to investors with quarterly redemption rights, requests for redemptions submitted during a quarter generally reduce AUM on the first day of the following quarter. Accordingly, quarterly redemptions generally will have no impact on management fees during the quarter in which they are submitted. Instead, these redemptions will reduce management fees in the following quarter. With respect to investors with annual redemption rights, redemptions paid prior to the end of a quarter impact AUM in the quarter in which they are paid, and therefore impact management fees for that quarter.\nInvestors in our closed-end credit funds, securitization vehicles, real estate and certain other funds are not able to redeem their investments. In those funds, investors generally make a commitment that is funded over an investment period (or at launch for our securitization vehicles). Upon the expiration of the investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nInformation with respect to our AUM throughout this report, including the tables set forth below, includes investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our AUM represented investments by us, our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties in our funds. As of that date, approximately 51% of these affiliated AUM are not charged management fees and are not subject to an incentive income calculation. Additionally, to the extent that a fund is an investor in another fund or vehicle, we waive or rebate a corresponding portion of the management fees charged to the fund.\nAs further discussed below in -Understanding Our Results-Revenues-Management Fees,\u201d we generally calculate management fees based on AUM as of the beginning of each quarter. The AUM in the tables below are presented net of management fees and incentive income as of the end of the period. Accordingly, the AUM presented in the tables below are not the amounts used to calculate management fees for the respective periods.\nAppreciation (depreciation) in the tables below reflects the aggregate net capital appreciation (depreciation) for the entire period and is presented on a total return basis, net of all fees and expenses (except incentive income on Special Investments), and includes the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Management fees and incentive income vary by product.\nSummary of Changes in AUM\nThe tables below present the changes to our AUM for the respective periods based on the type of funds or investment vehicles we manage.\n\n _______________\n(1)Includes the effects of changes in the par value of the underlying collateral of the CLOs, foreign currency translation changes in the measurement of AUM of our European CLOs and changes in the portfolio appraisal value for aircraft securitization vehicles.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, AUM increased by $1.3 billion, driven by performance-related appreciation of $1.4 billion, net inflows of $2.9 billion, distributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion, and a decrease of $468.6 million primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in par value of underlying collateral of the CLOs.\nThe net inflows were comprised of (i) $4.8 billion of gross inflows, driven by $2.9 billion in Institutional Credit Strategies, due to the launches of additional CLOs and an aircraft securitization vehicle, $1.2 billion in multi-strategy funds, primarily driven by inflows into the Sculptor Master Fund, which had the first positive net flows since 2014, and $708.3 million in real estate funds, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles and our real estate SPAC; and (ii) $1.9 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds.\nDistributions and other reductions of $2.6 billion were driven primarily by $2.1 billion of distributions from Institutional Credit Strategies as a result of the wind down and redemptions of certain of our CLOs, and $470.6 million of distributions from our real estate funds as a result of realizations. In 2021, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from high net worth and family offices, sovereign wealth and corporates, and pensions, while pensions, fund-of-funds, and sovereign wealth and corporates were the largest source of gross outflows.\nAs of February 1, 2022, estimated AUM decreased to $37.9 billion, driven by $330.5 million of performance-related depreciation, $59.4 million of distributions and other reductions as a result of paydowns in our CLOs, as well as a decrease of $38.0 million primarily driven by foreign currency translation adjustments in our European CLOs. These decreases were partially offset by $235.9 million of net inflows, primarily in our multi-strategy funds.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, our funds experienced performance-related appreciation of $1.9 billion and net inflows of $2.0 billion. The net inflows were comprised of (i) $3.4 billion of gross inflows, driven by over $1.0 billion of new assets into our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit hedge funds, the final close of Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV and the launch of a European CLO and an aircraft securitization vehicle, and (ii) $1.4 billion of gross outflows due to redemptions, primarily in our multi-strategy and opportunistic credit funds. Distributions and other reductions of $1.7 billion were driven primarily by Institutional Credit Strategies, as a result of a decrease in the number of aircraft serving as collateral in certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles for which we act as collateral manager, and by our real estate funds, which was primarily due to the expiration of the investment period for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. In 2020, excluding securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies, our largest sources of gross inflows were from corporate and other institutions, pensions, and private banks, while pensions and private banks were the largest source of gross outflows.\nWeighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\nThe table below presents our weighted-average AUM and average management fee rates. Weighted-average AUM exclude the impact of fourth quarter investment performance for the periods presented, as these amounts generally do not impact\nmanagement fees calculated for those periods. The average management fee rates presented below take into account the effect of non-fee paying AUM. Our average management fee may vary from period to period based on the mix of products that comprise our AUM. The average management fee rates below consider management fees on Economic Income basis. For reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the respective GAAP measures, please see -Economic Income Reconciliations\u201d at the end of this MD&A. \nFund Performance Information\nThe tables below present performance information for the funds we manage. The return information presented represents, where applicable, the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise each of the master funds presented. Gross return information is generally calculated using the total return of all feeder funds, net of all fees and expenses except management fees and incentive income of such feeder funds and master funds and the returns of each feeder fund include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Net return information is generally calculated as the gross returns less management fees and incentive income. Return information that includes Special Investments excludes incentive income on unrealized gains attributable to such investments, which could reduce returns at the time of realization. Special Investments and initial public offering investments are not allocated to all investors in the funds, and investors that were not allocated Special Investments and initial public offering investments may experience materially different returns.\nMulti-Strategy Funds\nSculptor's multi-strategy funds invest globally in high-conviction investment ideas across asset classes, regions and investment strategies with a primary focus is on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to direction of broader financial markets.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance for our multi-strategy funds. AUM are generally based on the net asset value of these funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees generally range from 1.00% to 2.00% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our multi-strategy funds had an average management fee rate of 1.24%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from the majority of our multi-strategy funds on an annual basis. Incentive income is generally equal to 20% of the realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor. A portion of the AUM in each of the Sculptor Master Fund and our other multi-strategy funds is subject to initial commitment periods of three years, and for certain of these assets, we only earn incentive income once profits attributable to an investor exceed a preferential return, or hurdle rate,\u201d which is generally equal to the 3-month T-bill rate for our multi-strategy funds. Once the investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate for these assets, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these assets. \n_______________\nn/m not meaningful\n(1)The returns for the Sculptor Master Fund exclude Special Investments. Special Investments in the Sculptor Master Fund are held by investors representing a small percentage of AUM in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 8.5% gross and 5.7% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 25.3% gross and 18.6% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 16.2% gross and 11.3% net.\n(2)The annualized returns since inception are those of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite, which represents the composite performance of all accounts that were managed in accordance with our broad multi-strategy mandate that were not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion since inception on April 1, 1994. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts, and the returns include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. The performance calculation for the Sculptor Master Fund excludes realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to currency hedging specific to certain investors investing in Sculptor Master Fund in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the Sculptor Master Fund on January 1, 1998. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion, has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future. As of December 31, 2021, the annualized returns since the Sculptor Master Fund's inception on January 1, 1998 were 13.4% gross and 9.0% net excluding Special Investments and 13.0% gross and 8.9% net inclusive of Special Investments.\nAUM in our multi-strategy funds increased $608.4 million, or 6%, year-over-year, primarily due to performance-related appreciation of $513.7 million and net inflows of $100.0 million. In 2021, the largest sources of gross inflows into our multi-strategy funds were from high net worth and family offices and sovereign wealth and corporates, while the largest sources of gross outflows were attributable to pensions and high net worth and family offices.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 7.8% and a net return of 5.0%. The fund profited predominately from positions within corporate credit, structured credit, and convertible and derivative arbitrage, partially offset by losses in equities.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Master Fund generated a gross return of 26.4% and a net return of 19.5%. Broad strength in risk assets rewarded our dynamic capital allocation and risk management framework. All of Sculptor Master Fund's risk-taking strategies generated positive performance in 2020.\nCredit \nOpportunistic Credit Funds\nOur opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally.\nCertain of our opportunistic credit funds are open-end and allow for contributions and redemptions (subject to initial lock-up and notice periods) on a periodic basis similar to our multi-strategy funds. Our remaining opportunistic credit funds are closed-end, whereby investors make a commitment that is funded over an investment period. Upon the expiration of an investment period, the investments are then sold or realized over a period of time, and distributions are made to the investors in the fund.\nAUM for our opportunistic credit funds are generally based on the net asset value of those funds plus any unfunded commitments, if applicable. Management fees for our opportunistic credit funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.75% annually of the net asset value of these funds. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our opportunistic credit funds had an average management fee rate of 0.83%.\nWe generally crystallize incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds at the end of a multi-year measurement period. This results in a timing difference between when we can recognize incentive income and when we accrue the associated discretionary bonus expense. Incentive income accrued at the fund level that cannot yet be recognized drives an increase in our ABURI balance. Compensation expense related to ABURI generated from our opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are recognized by us.\nThe table below presents AUM and investment performance information for certain of our opportunistic credit funds. Incentive income related to these funds (excluding the closed-end opportunistic fund, which is explained further below) is generally equal to 20% of realized and unrealized profits attributable to each investor, and a portion of these AUM is subject to hurdle rates, which are generally 5% to 8% for our open-end opportunistic credit funds. Once the cumulative investment performance has exceeded the hurdle rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these funds. The measurement periods for these AUM generally range from one to five years. \n_______________\n(1)The returns for the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund exclude Special Investments, which are held by investors representing a small percentage of AUM in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the returns of the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 22.3% gross and 17.3% net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 0.7% gross and -1.8% net, and annualized since inception through December 31, 2021 were 13.8% gross and 9.9% net.\nAUM in our opportunistic credit funds remained relatively flat year-over-year. This was driven primarily by $901.0 million of performance-related appreciation, partially offset by $799.7 million of net outflows.\nIn 2021, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 22.2% and a net return of 17.0%. In 2021 the fund saw positive contributions from both corporate credit and structured credit in both the U.S. and Europe, and the fund's returns represented their largest annual excess return over high yield, continuing our successful track record of delivering excess returns to high yield, particularly in the years following material spread widening periods.\nIn 2020, the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, generated a gross return of 1.1% and a net return of -1.5%. The gross return was primarily driven by broad-based positive performance in both spread-based investments where we added exposure during the crisis, in addition to a resurgence amongst our largest process-driven holdings. We deployed approximately $800.0 million of capital into credit in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic-related crisis, which helped drive a 23.1% net return for the fund from April 1, 2020 through year-end.\nOur Customized Credit Focused Platform invests in a flexible credit mandate across the credit spectrum to allow timely investments as market conditions change and dislocate. The table below presents investment performance for the fund.\n\n_______________\n(1)Performance presented is for the opportunistic credit strategies in the Customized Credit Focused Platform. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 94% of the invested capital in the Customized Credit Focused Platform is invested in the Platform's opportunistic credit strategies.\n(2)Weighted Average Returns reflect the total profit & loss divided by the weighted average capital base, which represents net asset value plus net contributions (distributions) for the period.\n(3)Gross IRR represents estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax returns based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for each investment. It is calculated in the same manner as Net IRR, however, it does not reflect adjustments to cash flows related to incentive income, management fees and the applicable fund expenses. Gross IRR represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized pre-tax return based on the actual and/or projected timing of cash inflows from, and outflows to, investors for each investment (irrespective of any funding from a credit facility or other third-party financing source used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform). In certain cases, funding from a credit facility or other third party financing source was initially used by the Customized Credit Focused Platform to acquire an investment or pay certain expenses, which may have the effect of increasing the Gross IRR above that which would have been presented, had drawdowns from limited partners been initially used to acquire the investment or pay such expenses. Gross IRR includes the effect of investment hedges as determined by the Company. There can be no assurance that an appropriate hedge will be identified for each investment or that an appropriate hedge will be available for all investments.\n(4)Net IRR is the Gross IRR adjusted to reflect actual management fees, incentive income and expenses incurred by the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n(5)Net invested capital multiple measures the current net asset value over the net invested capital, where net invested capital represents cumulative contributions less cumulative distributions. The Customized Credit Focused Platform has an active liquid investment program, a key element of which includes ramping up and ramping down depending on market conditions. Much of the capital has recently been deployed.\nThe table below presents AUM investment performance and other information for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds. Our closed-end opportunistic credit funds follow a European-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us only after a fund investor receives distributions in excess of their total contributed capital and a preferential return, which is generally 6% to 8%. Incentive income related to these funds is generally equal to 20% of the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund. Once the investment performance has exceeded the preferential return, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the net profits attributable to investors in these funds. These funds have concluded their investment periods, and therefore we expect AUM for these funds to decrease as investments are sold and the related proceeds are distributed to the investors in these funds.  _______________\nn/m not meaningful\n(1)Represents funded capital commitments net of recallable distributions to investors.\n(2)Gross IRR for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized return based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for the fund as of December 31, 2021, including the fair value of unrealized investments as of such date, together with any appreciation or\ndepreciation from related hedging activity. Gross IRR does not include the effects of management fees or incentive income, which would reduce the return, and includes the reinvestment of all fund income.\n(3)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (2), but is reduced by all management fees, as well as paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(4)Gross Multiple on Invested Capital ( MOIC\u201d) for our closed-end opportunistic credit funds is calculated by dividing the sum of the net asset value of the fund, accrued incentive income, life-to-date incentive income and management fees paid and any non-recallable distributions made from the fund by the invested capital.\nInstitutional Credit Strategies\nInstitutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs, aircraft securitization vehicles, CBOs, and other customized solutions for clients.\nAUM for Institutional Credit Strategies are generally based on the amount of equity outstanding for CLOs and CBOs (during the warehouse period), the par value of the collateral assets and cash held for CLOs and CBOs (after the warehouse period), and adjusted portfolio appraisal values for the aircraft collateral within the securitization vehicles. However, AUM are reduced for any investments in these CLOs and securitization vehicles held by our other funds. Management fees for Institutional Credit Strategies generally range from 0.25% to 0.50% annually of AUM. For the fourth quarter of 2021, Institutional Credit Strategies had an average management fee rate of 0.42% gross of rebates on cross-investments from other funds we manage (0.29% net of such rebates). These average rates exclude the net impact of deferred subordinated management fees which were deferred in 2020 and fully recouped in 2021.\nIncentive income from our CLOs and CBO is generally equal to 20% of the excess cash flows due to the holders of the subordinated notes issued by the CLOs and CBO and is generally subject to a 12% hurdle rate. Because of the hurdle rate and structure of our CLOs and CBO, we do not expect to earn a meaningful amount of incentive income from these entities, and therefore no return information is presented for these vehicles. We do not earn incentive income from our aircraft securitization vehicles. \nAUM in Institutional Credit Strategies totaled $16.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $354.6 million, or 2%, year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in AUM in Institutional Credit Strategies was driven primarily by the launches of six CLOs and a non-fee paying aircraft securitization vehicle, partially offset by the redemption and amortization of certain of our\nCLOs, as a result of natural life-cycle events, and decreases driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in underlying collateral value. Due to fee compression, our recent CLO launches have been at rates below our historical averages. Further in 2021, we priced twelve refinancing transactions in our existing CLOs extending the maturity of these transactions, but often at lower average net fees. Additionally, we refinanced our existing CBO in 2021. Refinancing CLOs and CBOs produces increased returns for subordinated note holders.\nReal Estate Funds\nOur real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets.\nAUM for our real estate funds are generally based on the amount of capital committed by our fund investors during the investment period and the amount of actual capital invested for periods following the investment period. AUM are reduced for unfunded commitments by our executive managing directors that will be funded through transfers from other funds. AUM for the special purpose acquisition company sponsored by us includes the proceeds raised in the initial public offering that are currently held in a trust for use in a business combination. Management fees for our real estate funds, exclusive of co-investment vehicles, generally range from 0.75% to 1.50% annually of AUM, however, management fees for Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I are based on invested capital both during and after the investment period. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our real estate funds, inclusive of co-investment vehicles, had an average management fee rate of 0.79%.\nThe tables below present AUM, investment performance and other information for our real estate funds. The amounts included within co-investment and other funds\u201d below mainly relate to co-investment vehicles. Our real estate funds generally follow an American-style waterfall, whereby incentive income may be paid to us after a fund investment is realized if a fund investor receives distributions in excess of the capital contributed for such investment, as well as a preferential return on such investment, which is generally 6% to 10%. Upon each subsequent realization, incentive income, which is generally 20% of realized profits, is recalculated based on the cumulative realized profits in excess of the preferential return attributable to each investor over the life of the fund. Once the investment performance has exceeded the preferential rate, we may receive a catch-up\u201d allocation, resulting in a potential recognition by us of a full 20% of the realized net profits attributable to investors in these funds.\nWe recognize incentive income on our real estate funds related to certain tax distributions on realizations at the fund level. Realizations at the fund level give rise to tax liabilities for our investors. Funds distribute capital back to investors to cover these tax liabilities and this in turn drives the recognition of tax distribution-related incentive income. In addition, incentive income is recognized as investments are sold and related distributions are made to investors. Due to the recalculation of cumulative realized profits upon each realization, the fund may clawback incentive income previously paid to us. As a result, we record incentive income paid to us by the real estate funds as unearned revenue in our consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for revenue recognition has been met.\nFor additional information on incentive income accrued at fund level for our real estate, as well as other funds, see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report.\nFor funds that have concluded their investment periods, we expect AUM to decrease as investments are sold and the related proceeds are distributed to the investors in these funds. \n\n\n_______________\nn/m not meaningful\n(1)An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received, including dividends, interest or other distributions of income and return of capital, represents at least 50% of invested capital.\n(2)Invested capital represents total aggregate contributions made for investments by the fund.\n(3)Total value represents the sum of realized distributions and the fair value of unrealized and partially realized investments as of December 31, 2021. Total value will be impacted (either positively or negatively) by future economic and other factors. Accordingly, the total value ultimately realized will likely be higher or lower than the amounts presented as of December 31, 2021.\n(4)Gross IRR for our real estate funds represents the estimated, unaudited, annualized return based on the timing of cash inflows and outflows for the aggregated investments as of December 31, 2021, including the fair value of unrealized and partially realized investments as of such date, together with any unrealized appreciation or depreciation from related hedging activity. Gross IRR is not adjusted for estimated management fees, incentive income or other fees or expenses to be paid by the fund, which would reduce the return.\n(5)Net IRR is calculated as described in footnote (4), but is reduced by management fees and other fund-level fees and expenses not adjusted for in the calculation of gross IRR. Net IRR is further reduced by paid incentive and accrued incentive income that will be payable upon the distribution of each fund's capital in accordance with the terms of the relevant fund. Accrued incentive income may be higher or lower at such time. The net IRR represents a composite rate of return for a fund and does not reflect the net IRR specific to any individual investor.\n(6)Gross MOIC for our real estate funds is calculated by dividing the value of a fund's investments by the invested capital, prior to adjustments for incentive income, management fees or other expenses to be paid by the fund.\n(7)This fund has invested less than half of its committed capital; therefore, IRR and MOIC information is not presented, as it is not meaningful.\nAUM in our real estate funds totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing $236.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year due to net inflows of $708.3 million, primarily due to the launches of several Sculptor Real Estate Fund IV co-investment vehicles, the launch of our SPAC, as well as additional capital called into Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I. The SPAC is non-fee paying AUM; our AUM will be reduced once and if the SPAC undergoes a business combination or in the event of its liquidation. This was partially offset by $470.6 million of distributions and other reductions, primarily related to Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I, as both of these funds are harvesting investments and making distributions. Our real estate funds continue to deploy capital and generate strong returns with an 18.6% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Fund III and 13.5% annualized net return in Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I.\nThe performance information presented in this Fund Performance Information\u201d section is not indicative of the performance of our Class A Shares and is not necessarily indicative of the future results of any particular fund, including the accrued unrecognized amounts of incentive income. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our existing or future funds will achieve similar results. The timing and amount of incentive income generated from our funds are inherently uncertain. Incentive income is a function of investment performance and realizations of investments, which vary period-to-period based on market conditions and other factors. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. Incentive income recognized for any particular period is not a reliable indicator of incentive income that may be earned in subsequent periods.\nLonger-Term AUM and Accrued But Unrecognized Incentive Income ( ABURI\u201d)\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 68% of our AUM were subject to initial commitment periods of three years or longer, excluding AUM that had initial commitment periods of three years or longer and subsequently moved to shorter commitment periods at the end of their initial commitment period. The table below presents the amount of these AUM. \nIncentive income on these assets, if any, is based on the cumulative investment performance generated over this commitment period. These amounts may ultimately not be recognized as revenue by us in the event of future losses in the respective funds. See -Understanding Our Results-Revenues-Incentive Income\u201d for additional information.\nThe table below presents the changes in the amount of incentive income accrued at the fund level but that has not yet been recognized in our revenues (ABURI) during the year ended December 31, 2021: \nIncentive income, if any, on our longer-term AUM is based on the cumulative investment performance generated over the respective commitment period. As of December 31, 2021, our ABURI was $226.9 million, up $98.6 million since the end of 2020. In 2021, $198.5 million of ABURI was generated driven by strong performance in our opportunistic credit funds primarily from certain open ended credit funds, which will largely not crystallize until after a multi-year period and last crystallized in 2020, and from Real Estate Fund III and IV, which are not expected to crystallize until closer to the end of their respective fund life. We recognized $99.8 million of incentive income from longer-term AUM in 2021, primarily from tax distributions from our Customized Credit Focused Platform and several of our real estate funds, which reduced our ABURI balance\nOur ABURI from longer-term AUM generally comprise the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. Multi-strategy ABURI is derived from clients in the three-year liquidity tranche, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year period.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. Opportunistic credit funds ABURI is derived from three sources:\n\u25e6Clients in the three-year and four-year liquidity tranches of an open-end opportunistic credit fund, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized at the end of each client's three-year or four-year period\n\u25e6Long dated closed-end opportunistic credit funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will be recognized during each fund's harvest period after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients\n\u25e6The Customized Credit Focused Platform, where incentive income other than tax distributions is recognized at the end of a multi-year term; previously crystallized on December 31, 2020\n\u2022Real estate funds. Real Estate ABURI is derived from long-dated real estate funds, where incentive income other than tax distributions will start to be recognized following the completion of each fund's investment period as investments are realized and after invested capital and a preferred return has been distributed to the clients.\nCertain ABURI amounts presented above will generally have compensation expense (on an Economic Income Basis) that will reduce the amount ultimately realized on a net basis. Compensation expense relating to ABURI from our real estate funds is generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized. Compensation expense relating to ABURI generated from our multi-strategy funds and opportunistic credit funds is generally recognized in the fourth quarter of the year the underlying fund performance is generated which may not occur at the same time that the related revenues are generated.\nUnderstanding Our Results\nRevenues\nOur operations historically have been financed primarily by cash flows generated by our business. Our principal sources of revenues are management fees and incentive income. For any given period, our revenues are influenced by the amount of our AUM, the investment performance of our funds and the timing of when we recognize incentive income for certain AUM as discussed below.\nThe ability of investors to contribute capital to and redeem capital from our funds causes our AUM to fluctuate from period to period. Fluctuations in AUM also result from our funds' investment performance. Both of these factors directly impact the revenues we earn from management fees and incentive income. For example, a $1.0 billion increase or decrease in AUM subject to a 1% management fee would generally increase or decrease annual management fees by $10.0 million. If profits, net of management fees, attributable to a fee-paying fund investor were $10.0 million in a given year, we generally would earn incentive income equal to $2.0 million, assuming a 20% incentive income rate, a one-year commitment period, no hurdle rate and no high-water marks from prior years.\nFor any given quarter, our revenues are influenced by the combination of AUM and the investment performance of our funds. For example, incentive income for the majority of our multi-strategy AUM is recognized in the fourth quarter each year, based on full year investment performance.\nManagement Fees. Management fees are generally calculated and paid to us on a quarterly basis in advance, based on the amount of AUM at the beginning of the quarter. Management fees are prorated for capital inflows and redemptions during the quarter. Accordingly, changes in our management fee revenues from quarter to quarter are driven by changes in the quarterly opening balances of AUM, the relative magnitude and timing of inflows and redemptions during the respective quarter, the impact of differing management fee rates charged on those inflows and redemptions, as well as the impact of the deferral of subordinated management fees from certain CLOs. See -Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d for information on our average management fee rate and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding management fees.\nIncentive Income. We earn incentive income based on the cumulative performance of our funds over a commitment period. We recognize incentive income when such amounts are probable of not significantly reversing. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information regarding incentive income.\nOther Revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of interest income on investments in CLOs, cash equivalents and long-term U.S. government obligations, as well as subrental income. Interest income is recognized on an effective yield basis. Subrental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIncome of Consolidated Entities. Revenues recorded as income of consolidated entities consist primarily of fee and other income.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits consist of salaries, employee benefits, payroll taxes, and discretionary and guaranteed cash bonus expenses. We generally recognize compensation and benefits expenses over the related service period. Due to multi-year crystallizations in our credit and real estate funds, we may recognize discretionary bonus expense as incentive is generated at the fund level but before the Company recognizes the related incentive income. For additional information on incentive income recognized at fund level but not yet recognized by us see -Longer-Term AUM and Accrued Unrecognized Incentive Income\u201d included in this annual report for additional information. We generally pay our bonuses in January of the year following the year in which bonuses were accrued.\nOn an annual basis, compensation and benefits comprise a significant portion of total expenses, with discretionary cash bonuses generally comprising a significant portion of total compensation and benefits. We accrue minimum annual discretionary cash bonuses on a straight-line basis during the year. The total amount of discretionary cash bonuses ultimately recognized for the full year, which is determined in the fourth quarter of each year, could differ materially from the minimum amount accrued, as the total discretionary cash bonus is dependent upon a variety of factors, including fund performance for the year.\nCompensation and benefits also include equity-based compensation expense, which is primarily in the form of RSUs granted to our independent board members, employees and executive managing directors, as well as RSAs, PSUs and Partner Equity Units granted to executive managing directors.\nWe also have profit-sharing arrangements whereby certain employees or executive managing directors are entitled to a share of incentive income that we earn primarily from our real estate funds. This incentive income is typically paid to us and then we pay a portion to the profit-sharing participant as investments held by these funds are realized. To the extent that the payments to the employees or executive managing directors are probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue these payments as compensation expense for GAAP purposes, which may occur prior to the recognition of the related incentive income.\nDeferred cash interests ( DCIs\u201d) are also granted to certain employees and executive managing directors as a form of compensation. DCIs reflect notional fund investments made by us on behalf of an employee or executive managing director. DCIs generally vest over a three-year period, subject to an employee's or executive managing director's continued service. Upon vesting, we pay the employee or executive managing director an amount in cash equal to the notional investment represented by the DCIs, as adjusted for notional fund performance. Except as otherwise provided in the relevant DCI plan or in an award agreement, in the event of a termination of the employee's or executive managing director's service, any portion of the DCIs that is unvested as of the date of termination will be forfeited.\nSculptor's compensation structure is designed to align the interests of our executive managing directors and employees with those of investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Our compensation structure focuses on both individual and firm-wide performance through bonus compensation in a combination of equity and deferred cash interests that vest over time.\nInterest Expense. Amounts included within interest expense relate primarily to indebtedness outstanding.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other. General, administrative and other expenses are comprised of professional services, occupancy and equipment, information processing and communications, recurring placement and related service fees, business\ndevelopment, insurance, impairment of right-of-use lease assets, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous expenses. Legal settlements and provisions are also included within general, administrative and other.\nExpenses of Consolidated Entities. Expenses recorded as expenses of consolidated entities consist of general, administrative and other miscellaneous expenses.\nOther (Loss) Income\nChanges in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities represent gains (losses) from changes in fair value of warrants.\nChanges in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability. Changes in tax receivable agreement liability consists of changes in our estimate of the future payments related to the tax receivable agreement that result from changes in future income tax savings due to changes in tax rates. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.\nNet Losses on Retirement of Debt. Net losses on retirement of debt consist of net losses realized upon the retirement of any indebtedness outstanding, and include the write-off of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, as well as other fees incurred in connection with the retirement of debt.\nNet Gains on Investments. Net gains on investments primarily consist of realized and unrealized net gains and losses on investments in U.S. government obligations and investments in our funds, including CLOs and other funds we manage.\nNet (Losses) Gains of Consolidated Entities. Net (losses) gains of consolidated entities primarily consist of changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities related to our consolidated SPAC.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes consist of our provision for federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and foreign income taxes, including provisions for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the tax and GAAP bases. The computation of the provision requires certain estimates and significant judgment, including, but not limited to, the expected taxable income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions, permanent differences between the tax and GAAP bases and the likelihood of being able to fully utilize deferred income tax assets existing as of the end of the period.\nThe Sculptor Operating Partnerships are partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Registrant was a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the Corporate Classification Change on April 1, 2019. Prior to the Corporate Classification Change, only a portion of the income we earned was subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Following the Corporate Classification Change, generally all of the income allocated to the Registrant from the Sculptor Operating Group will be subject to corporate-level income taxes in the U.S. See Note 14 for additional information regarding significant items impacting our income tax provision and effective tax rate.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by parties other than us and are primarily made up of Group A Units. Increases or decreases in net (loss) income attributable to the Group A Units are driven by the earnings of the Sculptor Operating Group. See Note 4 for additional information regarding our ownership interest in the Sculptor Operating Group.\nIn 2021, we consolidated our SPAC, wherein investors are able to redeem Class A shares issued by the SPAC. Allocations of earnings to these shares are reflected within net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the net income (loss) attributable to SPAC investors' interests in the SPAC is driven primarily by interest income generated on cash and cash equivalents, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of the SPAC and various expenses related to legal costs, business development and insurance. Additionally, the accretion\nof the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value is recorded within change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders \nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Class A Shareholders from the prior year.\nRevenues \nTotal revenues in 2021 were $626.1 million, decreasing $271.0 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $31.2 million increase in management fees, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $24.0 million increase in multi-strategy funds due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase in opportunistic credit funds due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.4 million increase in Institutional Credit Strategies due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022Real Estate Funds. A $2.8 million decrease in real estate funds due to lower management fees from both Real Estate Fund III and Real Estate Fund II, and related co-investment vehicles, due to lower average AUM as realizations decreased overall fund size.\nSee -AUM and Fund Performance-Weighted-Average AUM and Average Management Fee Rates\u201d above for information regarding our average management fee rates.\n\u2022A $304.5 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $124.7 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $1.9 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\n\u2022A $4.3 million increase in income of consolidated entities due to increase in other fee income of our consolidated entities compared to the prior year period.\nExpenses \nTotal expenses in 2021 were $551.1 million, decreasing $111.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $111.0 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories.\n\u2022A $5.5 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balance as we repaid $224.4 million under the 2020 Term Loan and $19.9 million under a CLO Investment Loan in 2021.\n\u2022A $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses driven by various offsetting items, including a $25.9 million increase in bonus expense due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nNote that as our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\n\u25e6 The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $17.4 million decrease in equity-based compensation expense primarily due to: (i) a $13.4 million decrease in amounts related to Group E Units, as the remaining units are being amortized on an accelerated basis (i.e., each tranche is being amortized over its respective service period), resulting in decreasing expenses in each subsequent vesting year on these awards; and (ii) an $8.2 million decrease in amounts related to Group P Units as a result of the related service period ending during 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in RSU amortization primarily due to acceleration of the compensation cost as a result of separation-related compensation for a departing executive. In addition, salaries and benefits decreased by $6.3 million, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022A $2.8 million increase in expense of consolidated entities due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of the consolidated entities from the prior year period.\nOther Loss \nTotal other loss in 2021 was $55.8 million, increasing $51.3 million, which resulted from the following:\n\u2022Changes in fair value of warrant liabilities. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are the result of an increase in the fair value of warrants to purchase our Class A Shares that were issued in connection with the 2020 Credit Agreement. The change was primarily due to the increase in our Class A Share price, an adjustment to the exercise price due to dividends, and the change in risk-free rate from the issuance date of the warrants to December 31, 2021. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details on warrants valuation inputs.\n\u2022Changes in tax receivable agreement liability. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are both a result of changes in projected future tax rates impacting the anticipated liability under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Net losses on retirement of debt. The amount in 2021 was primarily related to the $224.4 million prepayment of amounts outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million repayment of a CLO Investment Loan, while the amount in 2020 was primarily related to the $200.0 million and $45.0 million full repayments of amounts outstanding under the Debt Securities and 2018 Term Loan, respectively. The related losses on retirement of debt were comprised of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs that were proportionately written-off in connection with these repayments.\n\u2022Net gains on investments. The amounts in 2021 and 2020 both represent investment income on our equity method investments. In 2021, risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations both generated income, compared to losses in the prior year. Investment income increased by $926 thousand, primarily due to higher gains from risk retention investments in CLOs and U.S. government obligations, partially offset by lower gains on our equity method investments, primarily due to lower gains from our multi-strategy fund investments.\nIncome Taxes \nIncome tax expense decreased by $61.6 million. Income tax expense was lower primarily due the decrease in profitability in the current year and benefits recognized from state rate changes on deferred taxes.\nNet Loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nThe following table presents the components of the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests: \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021 was $11.3 million, decreasing by $11.6 million. During the Distribution Holiday, net income earned by any Sculptor Operating Partnership is allocated 100% to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc., while losses are allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. as described in Note 4.\nIn 2021, Sculptor Capital LP, which earns most of our management fees and incurs most of our operating expenses, generated a smaller loss than in the prior year period, as operating expenses were lower and management fees were higher in 2021 compared to 2020. Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP, along with Sculptor Capital Advisors LP, earn most of our incentive income. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors LP generated losses that were allocated on a pro rata basis among the Group A Units (noncontrolling interests) and Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. In 2021, Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP generated net income, and therefore we allocated 100% of its income to Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. Income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to entities we consolidated in 2021.\nChange in Redemption Value of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Preferred Units\nThe following table presents the change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests and Preferred Units: \nThe change in redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2021 was a loss of $25.9 million, increasing by $19.0 million from prior year. The amount in 2021 represents the accretion to redemption value of the Class A Shares related to our consolidated SPAC, while the amount in 2020 relates to adjustments to the redemption value of the Preferred Units, which were redeemed in full in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the discussion of results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nEconomic Income Analysis\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also reviews our results on an Economic Income\u201d basis. Economic Income excludes the adjustments described below that are required for presentation of our results on a GAAP basis, but that management does not consider when evaluating operating performance in any given period. Management uses Economic Income as the basis on which it evaluates our financial performance and makes resource allocation and other operating decisions. Management considers it important that investors review the same operating information that it uses.\nEconomic Income is a measure of pre-tax operating performance that excludes the following from our results on a GAAP basis:\n\u2022Income allocations to our executive managing directors on their direct interests in the Sculptor Operating Group. Management reviews operating performance at the Sculptor Operating Group level, where our operations are performed, prior to making any income allocations.\n\u2022Equity-based compensation expenses, net of cash settled RSUs, depreciation and amortization expenses, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, net losses on retirement of debt, gains and losses on fixed assets, and gains and losses on investments in funds as management does not consider these items to be reflective of operating performance. The fair value of RSUs that are settled in cash to employees or executive managing directors, where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is not certain at the time of the grant, is included as an expense at the time of settlement. Where the number of RSUs to be settled in cash is certain on the grant date, the expense is recognized during the performance period to which the award relates. Further, impairment of right-of-use lease assets is excluded from Economic Income at the time the impairment is recognized for GAAP and the impact is then amortized over the lease term for Economic Income. Additionally, rent expense is offset by subrental income as management evaluates rent expenses on a net basis.\n\u2022Amounts related to non-cash interest expense accretion on debt. The 2020 Term Loan and the Debt Securities were each recognized at a significant discount, as proceeds from each borrowing were allocated to warrant liabilities and the 2019 Preferred Units, respectively, resulting in non-cash accretion to par over time through interest expense for GAAP. Management excludes these non-cash expenses from Economic Income, as it does not consider them to be reflective of our economic borrowing costs.\n\u2022Amounts related to the consolidated entities, including the related eliminations of management fees and incentive income, as management reviews the total amount of management fees and incentive income earned in relation to total AUM and fund performance.\nIn addition, expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\nAs a result of the adjustments described above, as well as an adjustment to present management fees net of recurring placement and related service fees (rather than considering these fees an expense), management fees, incentive income, other revenues, compensation and benefits, interest expense, general, administrative and other expenses and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests as presented on an Economic Income basis are also non-GAAP measures.\nFor reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the respective GAAP measures, please see -Economic Income Reconciliations\u201d at the end of this MD&A.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to our GAAP net income allocated to Class A Shareholders or cash flow from operations, or as indicative of liquidity or the cash available to fund operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nEconomic Income (Non-GAAP)\n\nRefer below for the discussion of the contributing factors to changes in Economic Income from the prior year.\nEconomic Income Revenues (Non-GAAP) \nEconomic Income revenues in 2021 were $601.0 million, decreasing $275.2 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $30.4 million increase in management fees, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $20.4 million increase due to higher average AUM.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $5.6 million increase due to higher average AUM in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, as well as higher average fee-paying AUM in the Customized Credit Focused Platform.\n\u2022Institutional Credit Strategies. A $4.8 million increase due to the full recovery of $5.6 million of previously deferred subordinated management fees in 2021, as well as the launches of additional CLOs in 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases driven by: (i) the redemptions of certain of our CLOs during 2021 and new issuances at lower rates; (ii) a reduction in AUM in certain of our CLOs due to distributions; and (iii) a decrease in the portfolio appraisal value for certain of our aircraft securitization vehicles.\n\u2022A $302.8 million decrease in incentive income, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Multi-strategy funds. A $199.6 million decrease in incentive income from our multi-strategy funds, which was driven by Sculptor Master Fund which generated a gross return of 7.8% in the current year, as compared to strong performance by the fund in the prior year, with a 26.4% gross return.\n\u2022Opportunistic credit funds. A $123.0 million decrease in incentive income from our opportunistic credit funds, despite strong fund performance in the current year, primarily due to crystallizations in the prior year from certain open ended credit funds as their incentive crystallizes on a multi-year basis. This outsized crystallization event in 2020 drove a $147.2 million decrease in incentive year-over-year. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase in incentive from Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund which generated a gross return of 22.2% in 2021, as compared to a gross return of 1.1% in 2020.\n\u2022Real estate funds. A $20.6 million increase in incentive income from our real estate funds due to a $19.0 million increase in tax distributions taken to cover tax liabilities on accrued unrecognized incentive income, which represents incentive income at fund level not recognized by us yet, primarily from Real Estate Fund IV, Real Estate Fund III, and Sculptor Real Estate Credit Fund I and a $1.7 million increase in realizations, primarily from Sculptor Real Estate Fund II, as the fund is realizing investments during its wind-down.\n\u2022A $2.8 million decrease in other revenues driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates.\nEconomic Income Expenses (Non-GAAP) \nEconomic Income expenses in 2021 were $481.7 million, decreasing $88.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022A $125.8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses primarily driven by: (i) $119.4 million of legal provision accruals in the prior year; (ii) a $5.1 million decrease in professional services expenses, driven by lower legal and accounting fees, in part due to higher legal fees incurred in 2020 as a result of legal settlements; and (iii) reductions across various other operating expense categories, including reduction in occupancy expense due to a sublease, as we offset rental expense with subrental income for Economic Income.\n\u2022A $39.9 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses primarily driven by a $46.2 million increase in bonus expense, primarily due to factors outlined below:\n\u25e6Strong 2021 fund performance in opportunistic credit resulted in higher bonus expense. This performance resulted in an increase in ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods.\n\u25e6In addition, we recognized a significant amount of incentive income over the first three quarters with limited impact to bonus expense. Bonus expense related to this incentive income was expensed in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, which shifted attributable earnings into these quarters.\n\u25e6Further, our 2021 bonus increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a new senior management compensation arrangement, and a $32.2 million charge related to the issuance of certain cash-settled equity awards granted as part of 2021 bonuses, in place of RSUs, which were largely one-time in nature. The increase was partially offset by decreases in certain other performance related bonuses.\nAs our discretionary cash bonuses are generally determined based on fund performance in a given year, there may be differences in the timing of when bonuses are accrued and when the corresponding incentive income is recognized, particularly for performance generated on our longer-term AUM and AUM that have annual incentive income crystallization dates other than at year-end. In the fourth quarter we recognize discretionary bonuses, which are largely based on current year fund performance regardless of the year in which incentive income is recognized. It is best to look at our compensation ratio on incentive income over a multi-year period given the difference in timing of these line items.\nNote that expenses related to incentive income profit-sharing arrangements are generally recognized at the same time the related incentive income revenue is recognized, as management reviews the total compensation expense related to these arrangements in relation to any incentive income earned by the relevant fund. Further, deferred cash compensation is expensed in in the performance period for Economic Income, rather than over the service period for GAAP.\n\u25e6 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred cash compensation grants. The increase in bonus expense was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits, as our worldwide headcount decreased to 337 as of December 31, 2021, from 351 as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in headcount is expected to be temporary.\n\u2022A $2.6 million decrease in interest expense primarily due to interest no longer accruing on the Debt Securities or 2018 Term Loan, as these were repaid in full in the fourth quarter of 2020 in connection with the closing of the 2020 Term Loan. These decreases were partially offset by interest accruals on the 2020 Term Loan.\nFor the discussion of results of Economic Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019, please see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Economic Income Analysis\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, dated February 23, 2021 and filed with the SEC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThe working capital needs of our business have historically been met, and we anticipate will continue to be met, through cash generated from management fees and incentive income earned from our funds.\nWe ended the year with $170.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $205.4 million of longer-term U.S. government obligations (Treasury bills) and $193.6 million of management fees and incentive income receivable (the majority of which will be collected in the first quarter of 2022). We also have access to an additional $25.0 million through our undrawn 2020 Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan, leaving a balance of $95.0 million. In September 2021, we subleased a portion of our New York City office space. As a result of the sublease, we expect to save $14.3 million of rent costs through the lease maturity in 2029. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares, please see -Liquidity of Consolidated SPAC\u201d included in this annual report for additional information regarding SPACs.\nBased on management's experience and our current level of AUM, we believe that our current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from management fees will be sufficient to meet our anticipated fixed operating expenses (as defined below) and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For our longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund our fixed operating expenses through management fees and to fund discretionary cash bonuses and the repayment of our financing arrangements through a combination of management fees and incentive income. We may also decide to meet these requirements by issuing additional debt, equity or other securities.\nOver the long term, we believe we will continue to grow our AUM, including longer-term fee generating capital, and sustain positive investment performance in our funds, which will reflect positively on our revenue streams strengthening the balance sheet and providing the firm with stability to cover our long-term liquidity requirements.\nTo maintain maximum flexibility to meet demands and opportunities both in the short and long term, and subject to existing contractual arrangements, we may want to use cash on hand, issue additional equity or borrow additional funds to:\n\u2022Support the future growth in our business.\n\u2022Create new or enhance existing products and investment platforms.\n\u2022Repay amounts due under our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\n\u2022Repurchase Class A Shares or Sculptor Operating Group Units.\n\u2022Pursue new investment opportunities.\n\u2022Develop new distribution channels.\n\u2022Pay dividends.\nRecent Developments - Share Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The repurchase program has no expiration date. We may purchase shares on a discretionary basis from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or through the use of other techniques such as accelerated share repurchases. The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to our discretion based upon market conditions and other opportunities that we may have for the use or investment of our cash balances. The repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nLiquidity Needs\nOver the next 12 months, we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to:\n\u2022Pay our operating expenses.\n\u2022Pay interest and principal on our financing arrangements.\n\u2022Provide capital to facilitate the growth of our business, including making risk retention investments in CLOs managed by us that are subject to EU and UK risk retention rules and fund capital commitments to our funds.\n\u2022Pay income taxes, RSU tax withholding obligations and amounts due under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022Make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy.\nOperating Expenses\nWe generally rely on management fees to cover our fixed\u201d operating expenses, which we define as salaries, benefits, a minimum discretionary bonus and general, administrative and other expenses, including upcoming lease payments as presented in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, incurred in the ordinary course of business. No assurances can be given that our management fees will be sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses in future periods. To the extent our management fees do not cover our fixed operating expenses, as well as to fund any other liabilities, we would rely on cash on hand and incentive income to cover any shortfall. We cannot predict the amount of incentive income, if any, that we may earn in any given year. Total annual revenues, which are heavily influenced by the amount of incentive income we earn, historically have been sufficient to fund both our fixed operating expenses and all of our other working capital needs, including annual discretionary cash bonuses. These cash bonuses, which historically have comprised our largest cash operating expense, are variable such that in any year where total annual revenues are greater or less than the prior year, cash bonuses may be adjusted accordingly. Our ability to scale our largest cash operating expense to our total annual revenues helps us manage our cash flow and liquidity position from year to year.\nHistorically, we have determined the amount of discretionary cash bonuses during the fourth quarter of each year, based on our total annual revenues and fund performance. We have historically funded these amounts through fourth quarter management fees and incentive income crystallized on December 31, which represents the majority of the incentive income we typically earn each year. Related to performance on longer-term AUM, we accrue bonus expense on ABURI which will not be recognized as incentive income in the current year, but will have associated bonus expense in the current year period. This ABURI could crystallize into incentive income in future periods without the associated bonus expense, which would shift attributable earnings into future periods. In addition, to the extent our funds generate incentive income in the fourth quarter, we may elect to increase the amount of cash bonuses paid to employees over the amount already accrued throughout the year, with any incremental amounts recognized as expense in the fourth quarter. Although we cannot predict the amount, if any, of incentive income we may earn, we are able to regularly monitor expected management fees and we believe that we will be able to adjust our expense infrastructure, including discretionary cash bonuses, as needed to meet the requirements of our business and in order to maintain positive operating cash flows. Nevertheless, if we generate insufficient cash flows from operations to meet our short-term liquidity needs, we may have to borrow funds or sell assets, subject to existing contractual arrangements.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe may use cash on hand to pay interest and principal due on our financing arrangements, including debt obligations and repurchase agreements, prior to their respective maturity or due dates, which would reduce amounts available to distribute to our Class A Shareholders. We may also refinance all or a portion of any borrowings outstanding on or prior to their respective maturity dates. For any amounts unpaid as of a maturity or due date, we will be required to repay the remaining balance by using cash on hand, refinancing the remaining balance by incurring new debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or by issuing equity or other securities, which would dilute existing shareholders. See Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for details on our debt obligations and repurchase agreements.\nCLO Risk Retention Investments\nIn order to meet risk retention requirements for certain of the CLOs we manage, we use a combination of cash on hand, as well as financing under the CLO Investments Loans and repurchase agreements to fund our 5% risk retention investments. We expect to continue relying on a combination of cash on hand and financing to fund future CLO risk retention investments. Payments of interest and principal on these borrowings are generally due at such time interest and principal payments are received\non our risk retention investments in the related CLOs; therefore, our CLO risk retention investments and related financings generally have a net positive impact on our liquidity at each CLO interest and principal payment date.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe have made, and may in the future be required to make, payments under the tax receivable agreement that we entered into with our executive managing directors and Ziff Investors Partnership, L.P. II and certain of its affiliates and control persons (the Ziffs\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we generate sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization resulting from the increase in tax basis of certain Sculptor Operating Group assets, we expected to pay our executive managing directors and the Ziffs approximately $195.8 million. Future cash savings and related payments to our executive managing directors under the tax receivable agreement in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement are anticipated to increase the tax basis adjustment and, consequently, result in increasing annual amortization deductions in the taxable years of and after such increases to the original basis adjustments, and potentially will give rise to increasing tax savings with respect to such years and correspondingly increasing payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement is an obligation of Sculptor Corp, and any other corporate taxpaying entities that hold Group B Units, and not of the Sculptor Operating Group. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent the Sculptor Operating Group does not distribute cash to Sculptor Corp in an amount sufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.\nThe actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets resulting from an exchange or from payments under the tax receivable agreement, as well as the amortization thereof and the timing and amount of payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary based upon a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022The amount and timing of our income will impact the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreement. To the extent that we do not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the amortization deductions available as a result of the increased tax basis in the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets, payments required under the tax receivable agreement would be reduced.\n\u2022The price of our Class A Shares at the time of any exchange will determine the actual increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships' assets resulting from such exchange; payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from future exchanges, if any, will be dependent in part upon such actual increase in tax basis.\n\u2022The composition of the Sculptor Operating Group assets at the time of any exchange will determine the extent to which we may benefit from amortizing the increased tax basis in such assets and thus will impact the amount of future payments under the tax receivable agreement resulting from any future exchanges.\n\u2022The extent to which future exchanges are taxable will impact the extent to which we will receive an increase in tax basis of the Sculptor Operating Group assets as a result of such exchanges, and thus will impact the benefit derived by us and the resulting payments, if any, to be made under the tax receivable agreement.\n\u2022The tax rates in effect at the time any potential tax savings are realized, which would affect the amount of any future payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nDepending upon the outcome of these factors, payments that we may be obligated to make to our current and former executive managing directors and the Ziffs under the tax receivable agreement in respect of exchanges could be substantial. In light of the numerous factors affecting our obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are not reasonably ascertainable.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe table below presents the cash dividends paid on our Class A Shares in 2021 and 2020. We did not declare a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021 in respect of earnings for the fourth quarter. We did not declare a dividend in the first three quarters of 2020 in respect of earnings for the first three quarters. Dividends are generally declared and paid in the quarter following the quarter to which they relate. For example, the dividend paid on November 22, 2021 was in respect of earnings for the third quarter of 2021. We paid no related cash distributions to our executive managing directors on their Sculptor Operating Group Units in the respective periods as a result of the Distribution Holiday. \nAs discussed in Note 3, in connection with the Recapitalization, we and our executive managing directors agreed to a Distribution Holiday\u201d on the Group A Units, Group E Units, Group P Units and certain RSUs that will terminate on the earlier of (x) 45 days after the last day of the first calendar quarter as of which the achievement of $600.0 million of Distribution Holiday Economic Income is realized and (y) April 1, 2026. During the Distribution Holiday, dividends may continue to be paid on our Class A Shares. As of December 31, 2021, we have generated a total of $469.7 million of Distribution Holiday Economic Income, compared to the target of $600.0 million.\nDistribution Holiday Economic Income is the cumulative amount of Economic Income earned since October 1, 2018, less any dividends paid to Class A Shareholders or on the now-retired Preferred Units. Distribution Holiday Economic Income is a non-GAAP measure that is defined in the agreements of limited partnership of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships and is being presented to provide an update on the progress made toward the $600.0 million target required to exit the Distribution Holiday. Please see -Distribution Holiday Economic Income Reconciliation\u201d for a reconciliation of Distribution Holiday Economic Income to net income attributable to Class A Shareholders.\nDuring the Distribution Holiday, we expect to pay dividends on our Class A Shares annually in an aggregate amount equal to not less than 20% or greater than 30% of our annual Economic Income less an estimate of payments under the tax receivable agreement, and income taxes related to the earnings for the periods; provided, that, if the minimum amount of dividends eligible to be made hereunder would be $1.00 or less per Class A Share, then up to $1.00 per Class A Share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any equity dividend, equity split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Class A Shares). During the Distribution Holiday, (i) we will only make distributions with respect to Group B Units, (ii) the performance thresholds of Group P Units and PSUs shall be adjusted to take into account performance and distributions during such period, and (iii) RSUs will continue to receive dividend equivalents in respect of dividends or distributions paid on the Class A Shares. For certain executive managing directors, distributions on RSUs, as well as distributions counted in determining whether market performance conditions of Group P Units and PSUs are met, are limited to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.00 per Group P Unit, PSU or RSU, as applicable, cumulatively during the Distribution Holiday. Following the termination of the Distribution Holiday, Group A Units and Group E Units (whether vested or unvested) shall receive distributions even if such units have not been booked-up. See Note 13 for additional information\nThe declaration and payment of any distribution may be subject to legal, contractual or other restrictions. For example, as a Delaware corporation, the Registrant's Board may only declare and pay dividends either out of its surplus (as defined in Delaware General Corporation Law) or in case there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Our cash needs and payment obligations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and we may have material unexpected expenses in any period. This may cause amounts available for distribution to significantly fluctuate from quarter to quarter or may reduce or eliminate such amounts.\nAdditionally, RSUs outstanding accrue dividend equivalents equal to the dividend amounts paid on our Class A Shares. To date, these dividend equivalents have been awarded in the form of additional RSUs, which accrue additional dividend equivalents. The dividend equivalents will only be paid if the related RSUs vest and will be settled at the same time as the underlying RSUs. Our Board of Directors has the right to determine whether the RSUs and any related dividend equivalents will be settled in Class A Shares or in cash. We currently withhold shares to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to vested RSUs and dividend equivalents held by our employees, which results in the use of cash from operations or borrowings to satisfy these tax-withholding payments.\nHistorically, when we have paid dividends on our Class A Shares, we also made distributions to our executive managing directors on their interests in the Sculptor Operating Group, subject to the terms of the limited partnership agreements of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships; however, as part of the Recapitalization, the Sculptor Operating Partnerships initiated the Distribution Holiday. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding the Distribution Holiday.\nOur cash distribution policy has certain risks and limitations, particularly with respect to our liquidity. Although we expect to pay distributions according to our policy, we may not make distributions according to our policy, or at all, if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the distribution. Furthermore, by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses, we might risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our obligations, operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise. In such event, we may not be able to execute our business and growth strategy to the extent intended.\nRisks to Our Liquidity\nNet capital outflows from our multi-strategy funds over the last several years caused our management fees to decline for a period of time. While outflows have stabilized over the last couple of quarters and we continuously make every effort to scale our operations so that management fees are sufficient to cover our fixed operating expenses, our management fees may not always cover these expenses. Additionally, in the event that a future contingent liability were to arise that exceeded our liquidity resources, we would need to rely on new sources of liquidity such as issuing additional equity or borrowing additional funds.\nAny new borrowing arrangement that we may enter into may have covenants that impose additional limitations on us, including with respect to making distributions, entering into business transactions or other matters, and may result in increased interest expense. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations on terms that are favorable to us, our business may be adversely impacted. No assurance can be given that we will be able to issue new notes, enter into new credit facilities or issue equity or other securities in the future on attractive terms or at all.\nAdverse market conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk that our management fees and incentive income may decline if net outflows increase or as a result of performance-related depreciation in our funds. Lower revenues and other factors may make it more difficult or costly to raise or borrow additional funds, and excessive borrowing costs or other significant market barriers may limit or prevent us from maximizing our growth potential and flexibility. We have also evaluated our financing arrangements in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure compliance with debt covenants. Through the date of this filing, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants and expect to continue to be in compliance in the near term. Our ability to access financial markets, should it be necessary, may be limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur CLO risk retention financing arrangements are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants, but are subject to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type and also include terms that require our continued involvement with the CLOs. In addition to customary events of default included in financing arrangements of this type, the CLO Investments Loans may be accelerated to the extent there is an event of default ( EOD\u201d) at the CLO level. Prior to the relevant CLO's maturity date, this would include certain material covenant breaches, regulatory and insolvency events for the relevant CLO issuer, as well as a payment default where the relevant CLO is unable to make interest payments on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes issued by the CLO. For the repurchase agreements, in addition to customary events of default and covenants included in financing arrangements of this type, there are margin requirements that may cause us to post additional cash collateral; however, this is only triggered in the event of an EOD at the CLO level. Currently, we do not view any of the customary or CLO level EODs for these types of financing arrangements as a material risk. In particular, an EOD related to an\ninterest payment default on the senior, non-deferrable interest notes of the type of cash flow CLOs that we manage has been unprecedented even during the credit crisis in 2008 and 2009.\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark immediately after December 31, 2021, for sterling, euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023, the remaining U.S. Dollar settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had direct exposure to U.S. Dollar LIBOR-linked interest rate settings through its 2020 Credit Agreement, and certain CLO Investments and associated CLO Investment Loans.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we formed an internal LIBOR Transition Working Group to help effectuate an orderly transition from LIBOR. To address LIBOR cessation, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides for an agreed upon methodology to establish a new floating rate reference plus new applicable spreads. Each of the Company's CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans that reference U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will also be transitioned to an alternative reference rate. This transition will either be carried out through hardwired replacement mechanisms and/or amendment procedures in the existing governing documents for such CLO Investments and CLO Investments Loans or as a result of New York statutory process (the New York LIBOR Legislation\u201d) which was signed into law on April 6, 2021. Additionally, the firm is pursuing several technology initiatives to ensure that firm-wide accounting and master data systems are equipped to handle evolving market conventions associated with regulatory recommended reference rates. We expect to complete these technology initiatives in the first half of 2022 and will continue to monitor for any future changes in market standards. Our senior management has oversight of the Company's transition efforts, and periodic updates are provided to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For the face value of instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition that we hold on our books see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our credit arrangements and our collateralized loan obligation transactions\u201d in this annual report for additional information.\nOur Funds' Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur funds have access to liquidity from our prime brokers and other counterparties. Additionally, our funds may have committed facilities in addition to regular financing from our counterparties. These sources of liquidity provide our funds with additional financing resources, allowing them to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.\nOur funds' current liquidity position could be adversely impacted by any substantial, unanticipated investor redemptions from our funds that are made within a short time period. As discussed above in -AUM and Fund Performance,\u201d capital contributions from investors in our multi-strategy and open-end opportunistic credit funds generally are subject to initial lock-up periods of one to three years. Following the expiration of these lock-up periods, subject to certain limitations, investors may redeem capital generally on a quarterly or annual basis upon giving 30 to 90 days' prior written notice. These lock-ups and redemption notice periods help us to manage our liquidity position. Investors in our other funds are generally not allowed to redeem until the end of the life of the fund.\nWe also follow a rigorous risk management process and regularly monitor the liquidity of our funds' portfolios in relation to economic and market factors and the timing of potential investor redemptions. As a result of this process, we may determine to reduce exposure or increase the liquidity of our funds' portfolios at any time, whether in response to global economic and market conditions, redemption requests or otherwise. For these reasons, we believe we will be well prepared to address market conditions and redemption requests, as well as any other events, with limited impact on our funds' liquidity position. Nevertheless, significant redemptions made during a single quarter could adversely affect our funds' liquidity position, as we may meet redemptions by using our funds' available cash or selling assets (possibly at a loss). Such actions would result in lower AUM, which would reduce the amount of management fees and incentive income we may earn. Our funds could also meet redemption requests by increasing leverage, provided we are able to obtain financing on reasonable terms, if at all. We believe our funds have sufficient liquidity to meet any anticipated redemptions for the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity of Consolidated SPAC\nThe restricted cash and cash equivalents of SPAC are held in a trust account and include money market funds consisting of U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities of 60 days or less when purchased, that were purchased with funds raised through\nthe initial public offering of the consolidated entity. The $234.6 million in funds as of December 31, 2021, are restricted for use and may only be used for purposes of completing an initial business combination or redemption of public shares as set forth in the SPAC trust agreement.\nCash Flows Analysis\nOperating Activities. Net cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $476.7 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Our net cash flows from operating activities are generally comprised of current-year management fees, the collection of incentive income earned during the fourth quarter of the previous year, interest income collected on our investments in CLO's, less cash used for operating expenses, including interest paid on our debt obligations.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased from the prior year period due to higher year-end incentive income earned in 2020 than in 2019, a large portion of the 2020 incentive was collected in the beginning of 2021, as compared to year-end incentive income earned in 2019, a large portion of which was collected in the beginning of 2020. Additionally, in 2021 we collected more incentive income from our real estate funds compared to 2020. These increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by higher discretionary bonuses in 2020, which were paid in the first quarter of 2021, as compared to discretionary bonuses in 2019, which were paid in the first quarter of 2020.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(190.3) million, and $15.4 million, respectively. Investing cash outflows in 2021 and 2020 primarily related to purchases of U.S. government obligations and investments made in our funds, partially offset by maturities and sales of U.S. government obligations.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $(59.8) million, and $(82.7) million, respectively. Net cash from financing activities is generally comprised of dividends paid to our Class A Shareholders, borrowings and repayments related to our debt obligations, and proceeds from repurchase agreements used to finance risk retention investments in our CLOs. Distributions to our executive managing directors on their Group A Units (prior to the Distribution Holiday), are also included in net cash from financing activities. In 2021, our consolidated SPAC generated net proceeds of $234.6 million from issuance of its Class A Shares. These financing-related cash flows are of the consolidated entity and do not directly impact the cash flows related to our Class A Shareholders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $224.4 million of the 2020 Term Loan and a $19.9 million CLO Investment Loan. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the Debt Securities and the 2018 Term Loan, redeemed in full the 2019 Preferred Units, and borrowed $320.0 million under the 2020 Credit Agreement. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into $45.9 million of repurchase agreements to finance or refinance risk retention investments in our European CLOs.\nWe paid dividends of $84.2 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to dividends of $11.6 million to our Class A Shareholders in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the only dividend paid was in respect of the fourth quarter of 2019, which was paid on March 3, 2020. No distributions were made to our executive managing directors in the years ended December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020, as a result of the Distribution Holiday.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that require us to make significant judgments, estimates or assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements or the notes thereto. We base our judgments, estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and prudent. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our accounting policies. Set forth below is a summary of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates.\nFair Value of Investments\nThe valuation of investments held by our funds is the most critical estimate made by management impacting our results. Pursuant to specialized accounting for investment companies under GAAP, investments held by the funds are carried at their\nestimated fair values. The valuation of investments held by our funds has a significant impact on our results, as our management fees and incentive income are generally determined based on the fair value of these investments.\nGAAP prioritizes the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of assets and liabilities and the specific characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities with readily available, actively quoted prices (Level I) or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices (Level II) generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value than those measured using pricing inputs that are unobservable in the market (Level III). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 40% within Level I; approximately 41% within Level II; and approximately 19% within Level III. As of December 31, 2020, the absolute values of our funds' invested assets and liabilities (excluding the notes and loans payable of our securitization vehicles) were classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: approximately 35% within Level I; approximately 48% within Level II; and approximately 17% within Level III. The percentage of our funds' assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy will fluctuate based on the investments made at any given time and such fluctuations could be significant. A portion of our funds' Level III assets relate to Special Investments or other investments on which we do not earn any incentive income until such investments are sold or otherwise realized. Upon the sale or realization event of these assets, any realized profits are included in the calculation of incentive income for such year. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of our funds' Level III assets may not have any relation to the amount of incentive income actually earned with respect to such assets.\nValuation of Investments. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The fair value of our funds' investments is based on observable market prices when available. We, as the investment manager of our funds, determine the fair value of investments that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The methods and procedures to value these investments may include the following: performing comparisons with prices of comparable or similar securities; obtaining valuation-related information from the issuers; calculating the present value of future cash flows; assessing other analytical data and information relating to the investment that is an indication of value; obtaining information provided by third parties; and evaluating financial information provided by the management of these investments.\nSignificant judgment and estimation go into the assumptions that drive our valuation methodologies and procedures for assets that are not actively traded on a recognized securities exchange or otherwise lack a readily ascertainable market value. The valuation of investments can be more difficult when severe economic and market shocks occur. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of such a shock. The actual amounts ultimately realized could differ materially from the values estimated based on the use of these methodologies. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected could result in losses at the fund level and a decline in future management fees and incentive income. Such situations may also negatively impact fund investor perception of our valuation policies and procedures, which could result in redemptions and difficulties in raising additional capital.\nWe have established an internal control infrastructure over the valuation of financial instruments that includes ongoing oversight by our Valuation Controls Group and Valuation Committee, as well as periodic audits by our Internal Audit function. These management control functions are segregated from the trading and investing functions.\nThe Valuation Committee is responsible for establishing the valuation policy and monitors compliance with the policy, ensuring that all of the funds' investments reflect fair value, as well as providing oversight of the valuation process. The valuation policy includes, but is not limited to the following: determining the pricing sources used to value specific investment classes; the selection of independent pricing services; performing due diligence of independent pricing services; and the classification of investments within the fair value hierarchy. The Valuation Committee reviews a variety of reports on a monthly basis, which include the following: summaries of the sources used to determine the value of the funds' investments; summaries of the fair value hierarchy of the funds' investments; methodology changes and variance reports that compare the values of investments to\nindependent pricing services. The Valuation Committee is independent from the investment professionals and may obtain input from investment professionals for consideration in carrying out its responsibilities.\nThe Valuation Committee has assigned the responsibility of performing price verification and related quality controls in accordance with the valuation policy to the Valuation Controls Group. The Valuation Controls Group's other responsibilities include the following: overseeing the collection and evaluation of counterparty prices, broker-dealer quotations, exchange prices and pricing information provided by independent pricing services. Additionally, the Valuation Controls Group is responsible for performing back testing by comparing prices observed in executed transactions to valuations provided by independent pricing service providers on a monthly basis; performing stale pricing analysis on a monthly basis; performing due diligence reviews on independent pricing services on an annual basis; and recommending changes in valuation policies to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Controls Group also verifies that indicative broker quotations used to value certain investments are representative of fair value through procedures such as comparison to independent pricing services, back testing procedures, review of stale pricing reports and performance of other due diligence procedures as may be deemed necessary.\nInvestment professionals and members of the Valuation Controls Group review a daily profit and loss report, as well as other periodic reports that analyze the profit and loss and related asset class exposure of the funds' investments.\nThe Internal Audit function employs a risk-based program of audit coverage that is designed to provide an assessment of the design and effectiveness of controls over our operations, regulatory compliance, valuation of financial instruments and reporting. Additionally, the Internal Audit function meets periodically with management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to evaluate and provide guidance on the existing risk framework and control environment assessments.\nFor information regarding the impact that the fair value measurement of AUM has on our results, please see Part II-", "item_7_tables": "Table 22: <table><tr><td>

ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nKey points:\n\n- Sculptor reported a GAAP net loss of $8.6 million in 2021, compared to net income of $170.7 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive income and higher bonus expenses resulting from timing differences in recognition. \n\n- Revenues decreased by $271 million, primarily due to a $304.5 million decrease in incentive income, partially offset by a $31.2 million increase in management fees.\n\n- Expenses decreased by $111.5 million, primarily due to a $111 million decrease in general and administrative expenses from legal provisions in the prior year, and a $5.5 million decrease in interest expense. \n\n- As of December 31, 2021, assets under management (AUM) totaled $38.1 billion, up 6% from 2020, driven by performance-related appreciation and net inflows into multi-strategy funds.\n\n- Economic Income was $119.4 million in 2021, down from $306.1 million in 2020, primarily due to lower incentive income and higher compensation expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.\n\n- The Distribution Holiday continued in 2021, resulting in no distributions to executive managing directors. $84.2 million in dividends were paid to Class A Shareholders.\n\nIn summary, Sculptor's revenues and earnings decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower incentive income, while AUM increased driven by appreciation and inflows into multi-strategy funds. Management is focused on growing AUM and management fees to increase future revenues."}
