Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company completed its Merger with Cash America, whereby Cash America merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The accompanying audited results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the results of operations for Cash America while the comparable prior-year period includes the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016, affecting comparability of fiscal 2017 and 2016 amounts. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Merger.\nThe Company is a leading operator of retail-based pawn stores with over 2,100 store locations in the U.S. and Latin America. The Company's pawn stores generate significant retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers. The stores also offer pawn loans to help customers meet small short-term cash needs. Personal property, such as consumer electronics, jewelry, power tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments is pledged as collateral for the pawn loans and held by the Company over the term of the loan plus a stated grace\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperiod. In addition, some of the Company's pawn stores offer consumer loans or credit services products. The Company's strategy is to focus on growing its retail-based pawn operations in the U.S. and Latin America through new store openings and strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. Pawn operations accounted for approximately 96% of the Company's consolidated revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company organizes its operations into two reportable segments. The U.S. operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in the U.S. and the Latin America operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in Latin America, which currently includes operations in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nThe Company recognizes pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawn loans of which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical redemption statistics. If a pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the property is forfeited to the Company and transferred to inventory at a value equal to the principal amount of the loan, exclusive of accrued pawn fee revenue. The Company records merchandise sales revenue at the time of the sale and presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as income during the period in which final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nThe Company operates a small number of stand-alone consumer finance stores in the U.S. and Mexico. These stores provide consumer financial services products including credit services, consumer loans and check cashing. In addition, 362 of the Company's pawn stores also offer credit services and/or consumer loans as an ancillary product, which products have been deemphasized by the Company in recent years due to regulatory constraints and increased internet based competition for such products. Beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company no longer offers fee-based check cashing services in its non-franchised stores. Consumer loan and credit services revenue accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company recognizes service fee income on consumer loan transactions on a constant-yield basis over the life of the loan and recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. Changes in the valuation reserve on consumer loans and credit services transactions are charged or credited to the consumer loan credit loss provision. The credit loss provision associated with the Company's CSO Programs and consumer loans is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends, delinquency rates, economic conditions and management's expectations of future credit losses.\nStores included in the same-store calculations presented in this annual report are those stores that were opened or acquired prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period and remained open through the end of the reporting period. Also included are stores that were relocated during the year within a specified distance serving the same market where there is not a significant change in store size and where there is not a significant overlap or gap in timing between the opening of the new store and the closing of the existing store. Unless otherwise noted, same-store calculations exclude the results of the merged Cash America stores. Legacy Cash America same-store calculations refer to Cash America stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period (although not then owned by the Company) and remained open through the end of the reporting period.\nOperating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the Company's stores, including salaries and related payroll costs, rent, utilities, facilities maintenance, advertising, property taxes, licenses, supplies and security. Administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate offices, including the compensation and benefit costs of corporate management, area supervisors and other operations management personnel, collection operations and personnel, accounting and administrative costs, information technology costs, liability and casualty insurance, outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder-related expenses. Merger and other acquisition expenses primarily include incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details income statement items as a percent of total revenue and other operating metrics:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail merchandise sales\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pawn loan fees\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale scrap jewelry sales\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loan and credit services fees\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of retail merchandise sold\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of wholesale scrap jewelry sold\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loan and credit services loss provision\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses and other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Store operating expenses\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and other acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of common stock of Enova\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment -

Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates. The significant accounting policies that the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following:\nCustomer loans and revenue recognition - Receivables on the balance sheet consist of pawn loans and consumer loans. Pawn loans are collateralized by pledged tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan plus a stated grace period. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics. The typical pawn loan term is generally 30 days plus an additional grace period of 14 to 90 days depending on geographical markets and local regulations. Pawn loans may be either paid in full with accrued pawn loan fees and service charges or, where permitted by law, may be renewed\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nor extended by the customer's payment of accrued pawn loan fees and service charges. If the pawn is not repaid upon expiration of the grace period, the principal amount loaned becomes the carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value.\nThe Company's pawn merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company acquires pawn merchandise inventory through forfeited pawn loans and through purchases of used goods directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as retail merchandise sales revenue when the final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the precious metals to the buyer.\nThe Company accrues consumer loan service fees on a constant-yield basis over the term of the consumer loan. Consumer loans have terms that typically range from 7 to 365 days. The Company recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. The extensions of credit made by the Independent Lenders to credit services customers typically have terms of 7 to 365 days.\nCredit loss provisions - The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on consumer loans on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses in the collection of its consumer loans. The allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics (e.g., average amount financed and term), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nThe Company fully reserves or charges off consumer loans once the loan has been classified as delinquent for 60 days. Short-term loans are considered delinquent when payment of an amount due is not made as of the due date. Installment loans are considered delinquent when a customer misses two payments. If a loan is estimated to be uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance, including the sale of delinquent loans to unaffiliated third parties, are credited to the allowance when collected or when sold to a third party. The Company generally does not accrue interest on delinquent consumer loans. In addition, delinquent consumer loans generally may not be renewed, and if, during its attempt to collect on a delinquent consumer loan, the Company allows additional time for payment through a payment plan or a promise to pay, it is still considered delinquent. Generally, all payments received are first applied against accrued but unpaid interest and fees and then against the principal balance of the loan.\nUnder the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit. The Company is required to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. According to the guarantee, if the borrower defaults on the extension of credit, the Company will pay the Independent Lenders the principal, accrued interest, insufficient funds and late fee, if applicable, all of which the Company records as a component of its credit loss provision. The Company is entitled to seek recovery, directly from its customers, of the amounts it pays the Independent Lenders in performing under the guarantees. The Company records the estimated fair value of the liability in accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of the liability is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nInventories - Inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawns and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Inventories from forfeited pawns are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, inventory valuation allowances are established, if necessary, when inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. operations and Latin America operations. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the two-step impairment testing methodology. As described in -Results of Operations-Goodwill Impairment-U.S. Consumer Loan Operations\u201d below, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.9 million during 2015.\nThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, pawn licenses and franchise agreements related to a check-cashing operation. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nForeign currency transactions - The Company has significant operations in Latin America, where in Mexico and Guatemala the functional currency is the Mexican peso and Guatemalan quetzal, respectively. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date, and the resulting adjustments are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates occurring during the respective fiscal period. Prior to translation, U.S. dollar-denominated transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into their functional currency using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from remeasurement of dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities in Mexico and Guatemala are included in store operating expenses. Deferred taxes are not currently provided on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments as the Company indefinitely reinvests earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes certain operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The scrap jewelry generated in Latin America is sold and settled in U.S. dollars and is therefore not affected by foreign currency translation. A small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America are also billed and paid in U.S. dollars which are not affected by foreign currency translation.\nBusiness operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to fiscal 2016 only including the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 ( Cash America 2016 Partial Period\u201d), as the Merger was completed on September 1, 2016. Same-store retail sales decreased 1% in legacy First Cash stores and decreased 4% in legacy Cash America stores during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 35% during fiscal 2017 compared to a margin of 38% during fiscal 2016, reflecting the impact of historically lower margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory items in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories decreased 23% from $282.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $216.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of focused liquidation of aged inventories though promotional discounts and jewelry scrapping. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 6% overall and 7% and 5% in the legacy Cash America stores and legacy First Cash U.S. stores, respectively.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 94% totaling $380.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $195.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees increased 4%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn loan fees decreased 9% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017 decreased 6% compared to December 31, 2016 and decreased 7% on a same-store basis. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 6%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn receivables decreased 10% as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decline in legacy Cash America same-store pawn\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nreceivables and pawn loan fees was primarily due to the expected impact of reducing the holding period on delinquent pawn loans, optimizing loan-to-value ratios and to a lesser extent, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on pawn receivables in coastal Texas markets.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 150% to $119.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period and an increase in volume due to the clearing of aged inventory in the Cash America stores. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 6% compared to the prior-year margin of 13%, primarily as a result of the typically higher cost basis in scrap jewelry sold by the Cash America stores. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 compared to 2% in fiscal 2016.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 79% to $75.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $41.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 31% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Revenues from consumer lending operations comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 97% to $423.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses increased 2% and decreased 3% in the legacy First Cash and Cash America stores, respectively, compared with the prior-year period.\nU.S. store depreciation and amortization increased 77% to $24.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $13.6 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $244.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 19% compared to $148.7 million and 22% in the prior year, respectively. The decline in the segment pre-tax operating margin was primarily due to historically lower operating margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory levels in Cash America stores, resulting in lower gross profit margins on retail merchandise sales.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of

constant currency basis) to $333.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $283.1 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an 11% increase (12% on a constant currency basis) in same-store retail sales driven by strong retail demand trends, a 47% increase (50% on a constant currency basis) in retail sales in the 166 Maxi Prenda stores located in Mexico (acquired on January 6, 2016 and therefore not included in the same-store figure above) driven by operating synergies as a result of the utilization of the Company's proprietary IT platform and best practice retailing strategies, and the maturation of existing stores. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nInventories in Latin America increased 26% (20% on a constant currency basis) from $47.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $60.0 million at December 31, 2017. Increased inventory levels in the Maxi Prenda stores, which historically carried lower inventory balances than the typical First Cash store, accounted for 22% of the increase with growth from new store openings and the maturation of existing stores accounting for the remainder of the increase.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 11% (13% on a constant currency basis) totaling $130.3 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $116.9 million for fiscal 2016 as a result of the 19% (14% on a constant currency basis) increase in pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in pawn receivables reflects a same-store pawn receivable increase of 17% (12% on a constant currency basis) and new store additions. The increase in same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to strong demand for pawn loans and the maturation of existing stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 45% to $21.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to a reduced volume of scrapping activities in the Maxi Prenda stores during fiscal 2016 as those stores were being converted to the Company's proprietary point of sale and loan management system. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 6% (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 22%. The 22% scrap gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 was unusually high due to the 18% decline in the average value of the Mexican peso that year, which effectively lowered the cost of the scrap jewelry (scrap is sold in U.S. dollars but sourced in Mexican pesos). Scrap jewelry profits accounted for approximately 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 14% (15% on a constant currency basis) to $128.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 and same-store operating expenses increased 6% (increased 7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period. The increase in both total and same-store operating expenses was due in large part to increased compensation expense related to incentive pay and wage inflation.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $116.5 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 24% compared to $104.0 million and 25% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td>

Merger and a 36% increase in the weighted-average store count resulting in additional management and supervisory compensation and other support expenses required for such growth. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses decreased from 9% during fiscal 2016 to 7% during fiscal 2017, primarily due to synergies realized from the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $20.8 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger, which were depreciated and amortized during all of fiscal 2017 as compared to the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 during fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense increased to $24.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $20.3 million for fiscal 2016. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and other acquisition expenses decreased to $9.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $36.7 million during fiscal 2016, reflecting the timing of transaction and integration costs related to the Merger. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional details of Merger related expenses.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased through a tender offer, or otherwise redeemed, its outstanding $200 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.1 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 16.5%, primarily a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d) in fiscal 2017, as the Company recorded a provisional net one-time tax benefit of $27.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the tax benefit realized as a result of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 32.3% compared to 35.7% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in the adjusted fiscal 2017 effective tax rate as compared to the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in certain foreign permanent tax benefits and certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes during fiscal 2016, which increased the 2016 effective tax rate. The Company expects its effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be between 26.5% and 27.5% as a result of the Tax Act.

The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 96% of the increase in retail merchandise sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 38% compared to a margin of 41% during fiscal 2015, reflecting an increased mix of general merchandise inventories compared to jewelry inventories in legacy First Cash stores and the impact of lower margins in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories increased 405% from $56.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $282.9 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to the inclusion of $232.6 million of Cash America inventories partially offset by a 10% decline in legacy First Cash store inventories. Included in the Cash America inventory balance as of December 31, 2016 was $13.5 million of scrap inventories in transit or held in processing locations. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores carrying greater quantities of jewelry merchandise compared to legacy First Cash stores. The increase in inventory aged greater than one year was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America stores, which have historically carried higher aged balances than legacy First Cash stores, partially offset by a decrease in aged inventory at legacy First Cash stores.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 107% totaling $195.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $94.8 million for fiscal 2015. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2016 increased 330% compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn loan receivables was due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 101% of the pawn fee increase and 100% of the pawn receivable increase. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees declined 4% in fiscal\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to fiscal 2015, as a result of a 6% decline in the beginning of year same-store pawn loans. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores, which have historically carried a higher percentage of jewelry loans than legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 146% to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $19.4 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 92% of the increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 13% compared to the prior-year margin of 10%, due primarily to an 8% increase in the average spot price of gold in 2016. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 2% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016 compared to 1% in fiscal 2015.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 63% to $41.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $25.7 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 29% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Consumer/payday loan-related products comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to 8% during fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 100% to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $107.9 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses in the First Cash legacy stores were consistent with the prior-year period.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $148.7 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $81.5 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

(31% on a constant currency basis) to $283.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $252.3 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the retail revenue contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, which accounted for 53% of the constant currency increase, and a 10% increase in same-store constant currency retail sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% compared to a margin of 36% on retail merchandise sales during fiscal 2015.\nInventories in Latin America increased 28% (52% on a constant currency basis) from $37.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $47.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was consistent with the growth in store counts from acquisitions and store openings in Latin America and the maturation of existing stores. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry inventories and a lower percentage of general merchandise inventories compared to legacy First Cash stores.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 16% (35% on a constant currency basis) totaling $116.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $100.7 million for fiscal 2015. Latin America pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2016 increased 16% (37% on a constant currency basis) compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn receivables was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores, which accounted for 71% of the constant currency increase in pawn loan fees and 63% of the constant currency increase in pawn receivables. While Latin America same-store pawn receivables decreased 8% on a U.S. dollar basis compared to the prior year period, constant currency same-store pawn receivables increased 11%, primarily accounting for the remainder of the constant currency increase in Latin America pawn loan fees and pawn receivables. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry loans compared to legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 18% to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $12.7 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 22% (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 20%. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016, which equaled fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 13% (30% on a constant currency basis) to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $99.7 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Maxi Prenda acquisition, partially offset by an 18% year-over-year unfavorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso. Same-store operating expenses decreased 9% (increased 6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $104.0 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 25% compared to $87.2 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles pre-tax operating income of the Company's U.S. operations segment and Latin America operations segment discussed above to consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results of Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment pre-tax operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. operations segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America operations segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses and other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and other acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of common stock of Enova\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment -

As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses increased from 7% during fiscal 2015 to 9% during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $3.0 million during fiscal 2015, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased to $20.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $16.9 million for fiscal 2015 primarily related to increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility primarily used to pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger.

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes and, to a lesser extent, the increase in taxable U.S. sourced income due to the Merger, which is subject to a higher tax rate than taxable income sourced in Latin America.\nNet Income, Adjusted Net Income, Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nThe following table sets forth revenue, net revenue, net income, net income per share, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average diluted shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile as-reported GAAP net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2016 declined 1% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year primarily due to Merger and other acquisition expenses, adjusted net income and earnings per share increased 25% and 1%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The smaller increase in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was a result of an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding from the Merger. Adjusted net income removes certain items from GAAP net income that the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance, such as Merger and other acquisition expenses, but does not adjust for the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was $79.8 million, which is primarily held in Mexican pesos. The Company had working capital of $721.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and total equity exceeded liabilities by a ratio of 2.5 to 1.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Company completed an offering of $300.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due on June 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 1, 2017. The Notes were sold to the placement agents as initial purchasers for resale only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the proceeds from the offering to repurchase, or otherwise redeem, its outstanding $200.0 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d), to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and repaying borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The Company capitalized $5.1 million in issuance costs, which consisted primarily of placement agent fees and legal and other professional expenses. The issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the Notes as a component of interest expense and are carried as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its primary revolving bank credit facility. The Notes will permit the Company to make share repurchases of up to $100.0 million with the net proceeds of the Notes and other available funds and to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio ( Net Debt Ratio\u201d) is less than 2.25 to 1. The Net Debt Ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d) as the ratio of (1) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (2) the Company's consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of December 31, 2017, the Net Debt Ratio was 1.1 to 1, see the table below for additional information on the calculation of the Net Debt Ratio.\nThe Company may redeem the Notes at any time on or after June 1, 2020, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, prior to June 1, 2020, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a make-whole\u201d premium set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the Notes prior to June 1, 2020, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 105.375% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon a change of control, noteholders have the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase or redemption of the 2021 Notes which includes the tender or redemption premiums paid over the outstanding $200.0 million principal amount of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company maintained a line of credit with a group of U.S. based commercial lenders (the 2016 Credit Facility\u201d) in the amount of $400.0 million. In May 2017, the term of the 2016 Credit Facility was extended through September 2, 2022. The calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was also amended to remove share repurchases from the calculation to provide greater flexibility for making future share repurchases and paying cash dividends.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $107.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $5.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Facility, leaving $287.9 million available for future borrowings. The 2016 Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (with interest periods of 1 week or 1, 2, 3 or 6 months at the Company's option) plus a fixed spread of 2.5% or (ii) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of 1.5%. The agreement has a LIBOR floor of 0%. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.50% on the average daily unused portion of the 2016 Credit Facility commitment. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facility at December 31, 2017 was 4.00% based on 1 week LIBOR. Under the terms of the 2016 Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The 2016 Credit Facility also contains customary restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consummate acquisitions and similar negative covenants with customary carve-outs and baskets. The Company was\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nin compliance with the covenants of the 2016 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, and believes it has the capacity to borrow a substantial portion of the amount available under the 2016 Credit Facility under the most restrictive covenant. During fiscal 2017, the Company made net payments of $153.0 million pursuant to the 2016 Credit Facility.\nIn general, revenue growth is dependent upon the Company's ability to fund the addition of store locations (both de novo openings and acquisitions) and growth in customer loan balances and inventories. In addition to these factors, changes in loan balances, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to the Merger, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new store expansions and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Management believes cash on hand, the borrowings available under its credit facility, anticipated cash generated from operations (including the normal seasonal increases in operating cash flows occurring in the first and fourth quarters) and other current working capital will be sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated capital requirements for its business for at least the next twelve months. Where appropriate or desirable, in connection with the Company's efficient management of its liquidity position, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including the sale of assets, reductions in capital spending, the issuance of debt or equity securities and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory and adjust outflows of cash in its lending practices, gives the Company flexibility to quickly modify its business strategy to increase cash flow from its business, if necessary. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See -Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs such as general corporate purposes, growth initiatives and its stock repurchase program.\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(197,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance at December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>721,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio\n</td> <td>7.0:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities to equity\n</td> <td>0.4:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt Ratio (1)\n</td> <td>1.1:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Pursuant to the covenants of the Notes, the Company may make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's Net Debt Ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.

Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund pawn store acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. In addition, net cash flows related to fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans are included in investing activities. The Company paid $2.2 million in cash related to acquisitions during fiscal 2017 compared to $29.9 million in fiscal 2016. In addition, the portion of the aggregate Merger consideration paid in cash upon closing of the Merger, net of cash acquired, was $8.3 million during fiscal 2016. The Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn and consumer loans of $40.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to funding a net increase in loans of $16.1 million during fiscal 2016, and received proceeds of $62.1 million from the sale of approximately six million shares of common stock of Enova International, Inc. during fiscal 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $138.8 million from $58.7 million during fiscal 2016 to $197.5 million during fiscal 2017. Net payments on the Company's credit facility were $153.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to net borrowings of $202.0 million during fiscal 2016, which was primarily used to pay Merger related expenses and pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger. During fiscal 2017, the Company received $300.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of the Notes and paid $5.3 million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Notes and the extension of the 2016 Credit Facility. Using part of the proceeds from the Notes, the Company repurchased, or otherwise redeemed, the $200.0 million 2021 Notes and paid tender or redemption premiums over the face value of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million during fiscal 2017. The Company paid $2.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Credit Facility during fiscal 2016. In addition, the Company repaid $6.5 million in peso-denominated debt assumed from the Maxi Prenda acquisition and $232.0 million in debt assumed in conjunction with the Merger during fiscal 2016. The Company repurchased $91.7 million worth of shares of its common stock, realized proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million and paid dividends of $36.8 million during fiscal 2017, compared to dividends paid of $19.8 million during fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company opened 45 new pawn stores in Latin America, acquired five pawn stores in Latin America, opened two pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired one pawn store in the U.S. The cumulative all-cash purchase price of the 2017 acquisitions was $1.2 million, net of cash acquired and certain post-closing adjustments. During fiscal 2017, the Company also paid $1.0 million of deferred purchase price amounts payable related to prior-year acquisitions. The Company funded $37.1 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2017, of which $11.2 million related to the purchase of real estate primarily at existing stores with the remainder related primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and new store additions. Acquisition purchase prices, real estate purchase prices, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and start-up losses related to new store openings have been primarily funded through cash balances, operating cash flows and the Company's credit facility. The Company's cash flow and liquidity available to fund expansion in 2017 included net cash flow from operating activities of $220.4 million for fiscal 2017.\nThe Company intends to continue expansion primarily through acquisitions and new store openings. For fiscal 2018, the Company expects to add approximately 85 stores, primarily in Latin America, including plans for its first stores in Colombia. Additionally, the Company intends to continue purchasing the real estate from landlords at its existing stores as opportunities arise at attractive prices. Excluding these real estate purchases, the Company expects total capital expenditures for 2018, including expenditures for new and remodeled stores and other corporate assets, to total approximately $27.5 million to $32.5 million. Management believes cash on hand, the amounts available to be drawn under the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the Company's current operations and store expansion plans for 2018.\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential acquisition opportunities. The Company currently has no other contractual commitments for materially significant future acquisitions, business combinations or capital commitments. The Company will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. If the Company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future, the Company may seek additional financing, the terms of which will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 228,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.0 million and an average cost per share of $43.94. In May 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. The new share repurchase program replaced the Company's prior share repurchase plan, which was terminated in May 2017. Under the May 2017 stock repurchase program, the Company has repurchased 1,388,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $83.0 million and an average cost per share of $59.80 and $17.0 million remained available for repurchases as of December 31, 2017. On January 31, 2018, the Company completed the May 2017 stock repurchase program after repurchasing approximately 239,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2016 as it suspended its share repurchase program in 2016 due to the Merger.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, which became effective on January 31, 2018 upon completion of the May 2017 stock repurchase program. The Company intends to continue repurchases under its repurchase program in 2018 through open market transactions under trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, the dividend policy and the availability of alternative investment opportunities.\nTotal cash dividends paid in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $36.8 million and $19.8 million, respectively. In January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the annual dividend to $0.88 per share, or $0.22 per share quarterly, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The declared $0.22 first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $10.3 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts, will be paid on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 14, 2018. On an annualized basis, this represents aggregate dividends of $41.2 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts as compared to aggregate dividends of $36.8 million in fiscal 2017. The declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements and debt covenant restrictions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results (as defined or explained below) as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined in SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's operating performance and because management believes they provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude, among other expenses and benefits, Merger related expenses because it generally would not incur such costs and expenses as part of its continuing operations. The Merger related expenses are predominantly incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance and retention payments, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share ( Adjusted Income Measures\u201d) provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Income Measures, which are

The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and net fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities, and adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for Merger related expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP measurement of financial performance. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide investors with valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America operations segment tables in -Results of Operations\u201d above for an additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nContractual Commitments\nA tabular disclosure of contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving unsecured credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>107,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>104,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts\n</td> <td>14,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>893,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes interest obligations under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility.

The Company's stand-alone consumer loan stores and select pawn stores in the states of Texas and Ohio offer the CSO Programs. The Company's CSO Programs comply with the respective jurisdiction's credit services organization act, credit access business law or a similar statute. Under the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from the Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor extension of credit products originated by the Independent Lenders, the Independent Lenders are responsible for evaluating each of its customers' applications, determining whether to approve an extension of credit based on an application and determining the amount of the extension of credit. The Company is not involved in the Independent Lenders' extension of credit approval processes or in determining the Independent Lenders' approval procedures or criteria. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of active extensions of credit originated and held by the Independent Lenders was $9.7 million.\nSince the Company may not be successful in collection of delinquent accounts under the CSO Programs, the Company's consumer loan loss provision includes amounts estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit in the aggregate consumer loan portfolio, including those expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations. Estimated losses of $0.4 million on portfolios owned by the Independent Lenders are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes this amount is adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations.\nInflation\nThe Company does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the volume of customer loans originated, merchandise sales, or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the heavy repayment period of pawn and consumer loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping, and to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company completed its Merger with Cash America, whereby Cash America merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The accompanying audited results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the results of operations for Cash America while the comparable prior-year period includes the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016, affecting comparability of fiscal 2017 and 2016 amounts. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Merger.\nThe Company is a leading operator of retail-based pawn stores with over 2,100 store locations in the U.S. and Latin America. The Company's pawn stores generate significant retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers. The stores also offer pawn loans to help customers meet small short-term cash needs. Personal property, such as consumer electronics, jewelry, power tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments is pledged as collateral for the pawn loans and held by the Company over the term of the loan plus a stated grace\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nperiod. In addition, some of the Company's pawn stores offer consumer loans or credit services products. The Company's strategy is to focus on growing its retail-based pawn operations in the U.S. and Latin America through new store openings and strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. Pawn operations accounted for approximately 96% of the Company's consolidated revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company organizes its operations into two reportable segments. The U.S. operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in the U.S. and the Latin America operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in Latin America, which currently includes operations in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nThe Company recognizes pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawn loans of which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical redemption statistics. If a pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the property is forfeited to the Company and transferred to inventory at a value equal to the principal amount of the loan, exclusive of accrued pawn fee revenue. The Company records merchandise sales revenue at the time of the sale and presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as income during the period in which final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nThe Company operates a small number of stand-alone consumer finance stores in the U.S. and Mexico. These stores provide consumer financial services products including credit services, consumer loans and check cashing. In addition, 362 of the Company's pawn stores also offer credit services and/or consumer loans as an ancillary product, which products have been deemphasized by the Company in recent years due to regulatory constraints and increased internet based competition for such products. Beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company no longer offers fee-based check cashing services in its non-franchised stores. Consumer loan and credit services revenue accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company recognizes service fee income on consumer loan transactions on a constant-yield basis over the life of the loan and recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. Changes in the valuation reserve on consumer loans and credit services transactions are charged or credited to the consumer loan credit loss provision. The credit loss provision associated with the Company's CSO Programs and consumer loans is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends, delinquency rates, economic conditions and management's expectations of future credit losses.\nStores included in the same-store calculations presented in this annual report are those stores that were opened or acquired prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period and remained open through the end of the reporting period. Also included are stores that were relocated during the year within a specified distance serving the same market where there is not a significant change in store size and where there is not a significant overlap or gap in timing between the opening of the new store and the closing of the existing store. Unless otherwise noted, same-store calculations exclude the results of the merged Cash America stores. Legacy Cash America same-store calculations refer to Cash America stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period (although not then owned by the Company) and remained open through the end of the reporting period.\nOperating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the Company's stores, including salaries and related payroll costs, rent, utilities, facilities maintenance, advertising, property taxes, licenses, supplies and security. Administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate offices, including the compensation and benefit costs of corporate management, area supervisors and other operations management personnel, collection operations and personnel, accounting and administrative costs, information technology costs, liability and casualty insurance, outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder-related expenses. Merger and other acquisition expenses primarily include incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table details income statement items as a percent of total revenue and other operating metrics:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail merchandise sales\n</td> <td>59.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pawn loan fees\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale scrap jewelry sales\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loan and credit services fees\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of retail merchandise sold\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of wholesale scrap jewelry sold\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loan and credit services loss provision\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>53.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses and other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Store operating expenses\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expenses\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and other acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of common stock of Enova\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment -

Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates. The significant accounting policies that the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following:\nCustomer loans and revenue recognition - Receivables on the balance sheet consist of pawn loans and consumer loans. Pawn loans are collateralized by pledged tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan plus a stated grace period. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics. The typical pawn loan term is generally 30 days plus an additional grace period of 14 to 90 days depending on geographical markets and local regulations. Pawn loans may be either paid in full with accrued pawn loan fees and service charges or, where permitted by law, may be renewed\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nor extended by the customer's payment of accrued pawn loan fees and service charges. If the pawn is not repaid upon expiration of the grace period, the principal amount loaned becomes the carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value.\nThe Company's pawn merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company acquires pawn merchandise inventory through forfeited pawn loans and through purchases of used goods directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as retail merchandise sales revenue when the final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the precious metals to the buyer.\nThe Company accrues consumer loan service fees on a constant-yield basis over the term of the consumer loan. Consumer loans have terms that typically range from 7 to 365 days. The Company recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. The extensions of credit made by the Independent Lenders to credit services customers typically have terms of 7 to 365 days.\nCredit loss provisions - The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on consumer loans on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses in the collection of its consumer loans. The allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics (e.g., average amount financed and term), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nThe Company fully reserves or charges off consumer loans once the loan has been classified as delinquent for 60 days. Short-term loans are considered delinquent when payment of an amount due is not made as of the due date. Installment loans are considered delinquent when a customer misses two payments. If a loan is estimated to be uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance, including the sale of delinquent loans to unaffiliated third parties, are credited to the allowance when collected or when sold to a third party. The Company generally does not accrue interest on delinquent consumer loans. In addition, delinquent consumer loans generally may not be renewed, and if, during its attempt to collect on a delinquent consumer loan, the Company allows additional time for payment through a payment plan or a promise to pay, it is still considered delinquent. Generally, all payments received are first applied against accrued but unpaid interest and fees and then against the principal balance of the loan.\nUnder the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit. The Company is required to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. According to the guarantee, if the borrower defaults on the extension of credit, the Company will pay the Independent Lenders the principal, accrued interest, insufficient funds and late fee, if applicable, all of which the Company records as a component of its credit loss provision. The Company is entitled to seek recovery, directly from its customers, of the amounts it pays the Independent Lenders in performing under the guarantees. The Company records the estimated fair value of the liability in accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of the liability is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nInventories - Inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawns and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Inventories from forfeited pawns are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, inventory valuation allowances are established, if necessary, when inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. operations and Latin America operations. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the two-step impairment testing methodology. As described in -Results of Operations-Goodwill Impairment-U.S. Consumer Loan Operations\u201d below, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.9 million during 2015.\nThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, pawn licenses and franchise agreements related to a check-cashing operation. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nForeign currency transactions - The Company has significant operations in Latin America, where in Mexico and Guatemala the functional currency is the Mexican peso and Guatemalan quetzal, respectively. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date, and the resulting adjustments are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates occurring during the respective fiscal period. Prior to translation, U.S. dollar-denominated transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into their functional currency using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from remeasurement of dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities in Mexico and Guatemala are included in store operating expenses. Deferred taxes are not currently provided on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments as the Company indefinitely reinvests earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes certain operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The scrap jewelry generated in Latin America is sold and settled in U.S. dollars and is therefore not affected by foreign currency translation. A small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America are also billed and paid in U.S. dollars which are not affected by foreign currency translation.\nBusiness operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to fiscal 2016 only including the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 ( Cash America 2016 Partial Period\u201d), as the Merger was completed on September 1, 2016. Same-store retail sales decreased 1% in legacy First Cash stores and decreased 4% in legacy Cash America stores during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 35% during fiscal 2017 compared to a margin of 38% during fiscal 2016, reflecting the impact of historically lower margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory items in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories decreased 23% from $282.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $216.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of focused liquidation of aged inventories though promotional discounts and jewelry scrapping. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 6% overall and 7% and 5% in the legacy Cash America stores and legacy First Cash U.S. stores, respectively.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 94% totaling $380.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $195.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees increased 4%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn loan fees decreased 9% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017 decreased 6% compared to December 31, 2016 and decreased 7% on a same-store basis. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 6%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn receivables decreased 10% as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decline in legacy Cash America same-store pawn\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nreceivables and pawn loan fees was primarily due to the expected impact of reducing the holding period on delinquent pawn loans, optimizing loan-to-value ratios and to a lesser extent, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on pawn receivables in coastal Texas markets.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 150% to $119.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period and an increase in volume due to the clearing of aged inventory in the Cash America stores. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 6% compared to the prior-year margin of 13%, primarily as a result of the typically higher cost basis in scrap jewelry sold by the Cash America stores. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 compared to 2% in fiscal 2016.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 79% to $75.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $41.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 31% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Revenues from consumer lending operations comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 97% to $423.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses increased 2% and decreased 3% in the legacy First Cash and Cash America stores, respectively, compared with the prior-year period.\nU.S. store depreciation and amortization increased 77% to $24.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $13.6 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $244.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 19% compared to $148.7 million and 22% in the prior year, respectively. The decline in the segment pre-tax operating margin was primarily due to historically lower operating margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory levels in Cash America stores, resulting in lower gross profit margins on retail merchandise sales.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of

constant currency basis) to $333.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $283.1 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an 11% increase (12% on a constant currency basis) in same-store retail sales driven by strong retail demand trends, a 47% increase (50% on a constant currency basis) in retail sales in the 166 Maxi Prenda stores located in Mexico (acquired on January 6, 2016 and therefore not included in the same-store figure above) driven by operating synergies as a result of the utilization of the Company's proprietary IT platform and best practice retailing strategies, and the maturation of existing stores. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nInventories in Latin America increased 26% (20% on a constant currency basis) from $47.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $60.0 million at December 31, 2017. Increased inventory levels in the Maxi Prenda stores, which historically carried lower inventory balances than the typical First Cash store, accounted for 22% of the increase with growth from new store openings and the maturation of existing stores accounting for the remainder of the increase.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 11% (13% on a constant currency basis) totaling $130.3 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $116.9 million for fiscal 2016 as a result of the 19% (14% on a constant currency basis) increase in pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in pawn receivables reflects a same-store pawn receivable increase of 17% (12% on a constant currency basis) and new store additions. The increase in same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to strong demand for pawn loans and the maturation of existing stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 45% to $21.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to a reduced volume of scrapping activities in the Maxi Prenda stores during fiscal 2016 as those stores were being converted to the Company's proprietary point of sale and loan management system. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 6% (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 22%. The 22% scrap gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 was unusually high due to the 18% decline in the average value of the Mexican peso that year, which effectively lowered the cost of the scrap jewelry (scrap is sold in U.S. dollars but sourced in Mexican pesos). Scrap jewelry profits accounted for approximately 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 14% (15% on a constant currency basis) to $128.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 and same-store operating expenses increased 6% (increased 7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period. The increase in both total and same-store operating expenses was due in large part to increased compensation expense related to incentive pay and wage inflation.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $116.5 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 24% compared to $104.0 million and 25% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td>

Merger and a 36% increase in the weighted-average store count resulting in additional management and supervisory compensation and other support expenses required for such growth. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses decreased from 9% during fiscal 2016 to 7% during fiscal 2017, primarily due to synergies realized from the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $20.8 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger, which were depreciated and amortized during all of fiscal 2017 as compared to the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 during fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense increased to $24.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $20.3 million for fiscal 2016. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and other acquisition expenses decreased to $9.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $36.7 million during fiscal 2016, reflecting the timing of transaction and integration costs related to the Merger. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional details of Merger related expenses.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased through a tender offer, or otherwise redeemed, its outstanding $200 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.1 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 16.5%, primarily a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d) in fiscal 2017, as the Company recorded a provisional net one-time tax benefit of $27.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the tax benefit realized as a result of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 32.3% compared to 35.7% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in the adjusted fiscal 2017 effective tax rate as compared to the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in certain foreign permanent tax benefits and certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes during fiscal 2016, which increased the 2016 effective tax rate. The Company expects its effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be between 26.5% and 27.5% as a result of the Tax Act.

The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 96% of the increase in retail merchandise sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 38% compared to a margin of 41% during fiscal 2015, reflecting an increased mix of general merchandise inventories compared to jewelry inventories in legacy First Cash stores and the impact of lower margins in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories increased 405% from $56.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $282.9 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to the inclusion of $232.6 million of Cash America inventories partially offset by a 10% decline in legacy First Cash store inventories. Included in the Cash America inventory balance as of December 31, 2016 was $13.5 million of scrap inventories in transit or held in processing locations. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores carrying greater quantities of jewelry merchandise compared to legacy First Cash stores. The increase in inventory aged greater than one year was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America stores, which have historically carried higher aged balances than legacy First Cash stores, partially offset by a decrease in aged inventory at legacy First Cash stores.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 107% totaling $195.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $94.8 million for fiscal 2015. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2016 increased 330% compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn loan receivables was due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 101% of the pawn fee increase and 100% of the pawn receivable increase. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees declined 4% in fiscal\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 compared to fiscal 2015, as a result of a 6% decline in the beginning of year same-store pawn loans. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores, which have historically carried a higher percentage of jewelry loans than legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 146% to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $19.4 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 92% of the increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 13% compared to the prior-year margin of 10%, due primarily to an 8% increase in the average spot price of gold in 2016. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 2% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016 compared to 1% in fiscal 2015.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 63% to $41.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $25.7 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 29% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Consumer/payday loan-related products comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to 8% during fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 100% to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $107.9 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses in the First Cash legacy stores were consistent with the prior-year period.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $148.7 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $81.5 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

(31% on a constant currency basis) to $283.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $252.3 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the retail revenue contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, which accounted for 53% of the constant currency increase, and a 10% increase in same-store constant currency retail sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% compared to a margin of 36% on retail merchandise sales during fiscal 2015.\nInventories in Latin America increased 28% (52% on a constant currency basis) from $37.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $47.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was consistent with the growth in store counts from acquisitions and store openings in Latin America and the maturation of existing stores. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry inventories and a lower percentage of general merchandise inventories compared to legacy First Cash stores.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 16% (35% on a constant currency basis) totaling $116.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $100.7 million for fiscal 2015. Latin America pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2016 increased 16% (37% on a constant currency basis) compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn receivables was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores, which accounted for 71% of the constant currency increase in pawn loan fees and 63% of the constant currency increase in pawn receivables. While Latin America same-store pawn receivables decreased 8% on a U.S. dollar basis compared to the prior year period, constant currency same-store pawn receivables increased 11%, primarily accounting for the remainder of the constant currency increase in Latin America pawn loan fees and pawn receivables. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry loans compared to legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 18% to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $12.7 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 22% (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 20%. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016, which equaled fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 13% (30% on a constant currency basis) to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $99.7 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Maxi Prenda acquisition, partially offset by an 18% year-over-year unfavorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso. Same-store operating expenses decreased 9% (increased 6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $104.0 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 25% compared to $87.2 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles pre-tax operating income of the Company's U.S. operations segment and Latin America operations segment discussed above to consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results of Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment pre-tax operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. operations segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America operations segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated segment pre-tax operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses and other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and other acquisition expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on sale of common stock of Enova\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment -

As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses increased from 7% during fiscal 2015 to 9% during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $3.0 million during fiscal 2015, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased to $20.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $16.9 million for fiscal 2015 primarily related to increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility primarily used to pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger.

The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes and, to a lesser extent, the increase in taxable U.S. sourced income due to the Merger, which is subject to a higher tax rate than taxable income sourced in Latin America.\nNet Income, Adjusted Net Income, Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nThe following table sets forth revenue, net revenue, net income, net income per share, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Non-GAAP)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,088,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>704,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average diluted shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile as-reported GAAP net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2016 declined 1% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year primarily due to Merger and other acquisition expenses, adjusted net income and earnings per share increased 25% and 1%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The smaller increase in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was a result of an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding from the Merger. Adjusted net income removes certain items from GAAP net income that the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance, such as Merger and other acquisition expenses, but does not adjust for the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was $79.8 million, which is primarily held in Mexican pesos. The Company had working capital of $721.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and total equity exceeded liabilities by a ratio of 2.5 to 1.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Company completed an offering of $300.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due on June 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 1, 2017. The Notes were sold to the placement agents as initial purchasers for resale only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the proceeds from the offering to repurchase, or otherwise redeem, its outstanding $200.0 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d), to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and repaying borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The Company capitalized $5.1 million in issuance costs, which consisted primarily of placement agent fees and legal and other professional expenses. The issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the Notes as a component of interest expense and are carried as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its primary revolving bank credit facility. The Notes will permit the Company to make share repurchases of up to $100.0 million with the net proceeds of the Notes and other available funds and to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio ( Net Debt Ratio\u201d) is less than 2.25 to 1. The Net Debt Ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d) as the ratio of (1) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (2) the Company's consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of December 31, 2017, the Net Debt Ratio was 1.1 to 1, see the table below for additional information on the calculation of the Net Debt Ratio.\nThe Company may redeem the Notes at any time on or after June 1, 2020, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, prior to June 1, 2020, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a make-whole\u201d premium set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the Notes prior to June 1, 2020, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 105.375% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon a change of control, noteholders have the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase or redemption of the 2021 Notes which includes the tender or redemption premiums paid over the outstanding $200.0 million principal amount of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company maintained a line of credit with a group of U.S. based commercial lenders (the 2016 Credit Facility\u201d) in the amount of $400.0 million. In May 2017, the term of the 2016 Credit Facility was extended through September 2, 2022. The calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was also amended to remove share repurchases from the calculation to provide greater flexibility for making future share repurchases and paying cash dividends.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $107.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $5.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Facility, leaving $287.9 million available for future borrowings. The 2016 Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (with interest periods of 1 week or 1, 2, 3 or 6 months at the Company's option) plus a fixed spread of 2.5% or (ii) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of 1.5%. The agreement has a LIBOR floor of 0%. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.50% on the average daily unused portion of the 2016 Credit Facility commitment. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facility at December 31, 2017 was 4.00% based on 1 week LIBOR. Under the terms of the 2016 Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The 2016 Credit Facility also contains customary restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consummate acquisitions and similar negative covenants with customary carve-outs and baskets. The Company was\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nin compliance with the covenants of the 2016 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, and believes it has the capacity to borrow a substantial portion of the amount available under the 2016 Credit Facility under the most restrictive covenant. During fiscal 2017, the Company made net payments of $153.0 million pursuant to the 2016 Credit Facility.\nIn general, revenue growth is dependent upon the Company's ability to fund the addition of store locations (both de novo openings and acquisitions) and growth in customer loan balances and inventories. In addition to these factors, changes in loan balances, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to the Merger, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new store expansions and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Management believes cash on hand, the borrowings available under its credit facility, anticipated cash generated from operations (including the normal seasonal increases in operating cash flows occurring in the first and fourth quarters) and other current working capital will be sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated capital requirements for its business for at least the next twelve months. Where appropriate or desirable, in connection with the Company's efficient management of its liquidity position, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including the sale of assets, reductions in capital spending, the issuance of debt or equity securities and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory and adjust outflows of cash in its lending practices, gives the Company flexibility to quickly modify its business strategy to increase cash flow from its business, if necessary. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See -Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs such as general corporate purposes, growth initiatives and its stock repurchase program.\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,967\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,676\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(197,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58,713\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Balance at December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>721,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>748,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio\n</td> <td>7.0:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities to equity\n</td> <td>0.4:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt Ratio (1)\n</td> <td>1.1:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3:1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Pursuant to the covenants of the Notes, the Company may make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's Net Debt Ratio is less than 2.25 to 1. Adjusted EBITDA, a component of the Net Debt Ratio, is a non-GAAP measure. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a calculation of the Net Debt Ratio. \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $123.5 million, or 128%, from $96.9 million for fiscal 2016 to $220.4 million for fiscal 2017, due primarily to an increase in net income of $83.8 million and net changes in certain adjustments and operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the statements of cash flows).\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $27.4 million, or 105%, from net cash used in investing activities of $26.0 million during fiscal 2016 to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.4 million during fiscal 2017. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund pawn store acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. In addition, net cash flows related to fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans are included in investing activities. The Company paid $2.2 million in cash related to acquisitions during fiscal 2017 compared to $29.9 million in fiscal 2016. In addition, the portion of the aggregate Merger consideration paid in cash upon closing of the Merger, net of cash acquired, was $8.3 million during fiscal 2016. The Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn and consumer loans of $40.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to funding a net increase in loans of $16.1 million during fiscal 2016, and received proceeds of $62.1 million from the sale of approximately six million shares of common stock of Enova International, Inc. during fiscal 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $138.8 million from $58.7 million during fiscal 2016 to $197.5 million during fiscal 2017. Net payments on the Company's credit facility were $153.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to net borrowings of $202.0 million during fiscal 2016, which was primarily used to pay Merger related expenses and pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger. During fiscal 2017, the Company received $300.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of the Notes and paid $5.3 million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Notes and the extension of the 2016 Credit Facility. Using part of the proceeds from the Notes, the Company repurchased, or otherwise redeemed, the $200.0 million 2021 Notes and paid tender or redemption premiums over the face value of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million during fiscal 2017. The Company paid $2.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Credit Facility during fiscal 2016. In addition, the Company repaid $6.5 million in peso-denominated debt assumed from the Maxi Prenda acquisition and $232.0 million in debt assumed in conjunction with the Merger during fiscal 2016. The Company repurchased $91.7 million worth of shares of its common stock, realized proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million and paid dividends of $36.8 million during fiscal 2017, compared to dividends paid of $19.8 million during fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company opened 45 new pawn stores in Latin America, acquired five pawn stores in Latin America, opened two pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired one pawn store in the U.S. The cumulative all-cash purchase price of the 2017 acquisitions was $1.2 million, net of cash acquired and certain post-closing adjustments. During fiscal 2017, the Company also paid $1.0 million of deferred purchase price amounts payable related to prior-year acquisitions. The Company funded $37.1 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2017, of which $11.2 million related to the purchase of real estate primarily at existing stores with the remainder related primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and new store additions. Acquisition purchase prices, real estate purchase prices, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and start-up losses related to new store openings have been primarily funded through cash balances, operating cash flows and the Company's credit facility. The Company's cash flow and liquidity available to fund expansion in 2017 included net cash flow from operating activities of $220.4 million for fiscal 2017.\nThe Company intends to continue expansion primarily through acquisitions and new store openings. For fiscal 2018, the Company expects to add approximately 85 stores, primarily in Latin America, including plans for its first stores in Colombia. Additionally, the Company intends to continue purchasing the real estate from landlords at its existing stores as opportunities arise at attractive prices. Excluding these real estate purchases, the Company expects total capital expenditures for 2018, including expenditures for new and remodeled stores and other corporate assets, to total approximately $27.5 million to $32.5 million. Management believes cash on hand, the amounts available to be drawn under the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the Company's current operations and store expansion plans for 2018.\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential acquisition opportunities. The Company currently has no other contractual commitments for materially significant future acquisitions, business combinations or capital commitments. The Company will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. If the Company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future, the Company may seek additional financing, the terms of which will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 228,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.0 million and an average cost per share of $43.94. In May 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. The new share repurchase program replaced the Company's prior share repurchase plan, which was terminated in May 2017. Under the May 2017 stock repurchase program, the Company has repurchased 1,388,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $83.0 million and an average cost per share of $59.80 and $17.0 million remained available for repurchases as of December 31, 2017. On January 31, 2018, the Company completed the May 2017 stock repurchase program after repurchasing approximately 239,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2016 as it suspended its share repurchase program in 2016 due to the Merger.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, which became effective on January 31, 2018 upon completion of the May 2017 stock repurchase program. The Company intends to continue repurchases under its repurchase program in 2018 through open market transactions under trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, the dividend policy and the availability of alternative investment opportunities.\nTotal cash dividends paid in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $36.8 million and $19.8 million, respectively. In January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the annual dividend to $0.88 per share, or $0.22 per share quarterly, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The declared $0.22 first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $10.3 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts, will be paid on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 14, 2018. On an annualized basis, this represents aggregate dividends of $41.2 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts as compared to aggregate dividends of $36.8 million in fiscal 2017. The declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements and debt covenant restrictions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results (as defined or explained below) as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined in SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's operating performance and because management believes they provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude, among other expenses and benefits, Merger related expenses because it generally would not incur such costs and expenses as part of its continuing operations. The Merger related expenses are predominantly incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance and retention payments, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share ( Adjusted Income Measures\u201d) provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Income Measures, which are

The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and net fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities, and adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for Merger related expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles net cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands):\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from investing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan receivables, net of cash repayments\n</td> <td>40,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property and equipment (1)\n</td> <td>(37,135\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>223,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger related expenses paid, net of tax benefit\n</td> <td>6,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes $11.2 million, $13.4 million and $3.6 million of real estate expenditures primarily at existing stores for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP measurement of financial performance. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide investors with valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America operations segment tables in -Results of Operations\u201d above for an additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nContractual Commitments\nA tabular disclosure of contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving unsecured credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>107,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td>104,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment contracts\n</td> <td>14,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>893,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>363,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Excludes interest obligations under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company offers a fee-based credit services organization program to assist consumers in obtaining extensions of credit. The Company's stand-alone consumer loan stores and select pawn stores in the states of Texas and Ohio offer the CSO Programs. The Company's CSO Programs comply with the respective jurisdiction's credit services organization act, credit access business law or a similar statute. Under the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from the Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor extension of credit products originated by the Independent Lenders, the Independent Lenders are responsible for evaluating each of its customers' applications, determining whether to approve an extension of credit based on an application and determining the amount of the extension of credit. The Company is not involved in the Independent Lenders' extension of credit approval processes or in determining the Independent Lenders' approval procedures or criteria. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of active extensions of credit originated and held by the Independent Lenders was $9.7 million.\nSince the Company may not be successful in collection of delinquent accounts under the CSO Programs, the Company's consumer loan loss provision includes amounts estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit in the aggregate consumer loan portfolio, including those expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations. Estimated losses of $0.4 million on portfolios owned by the Independent Lenders are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes this amount is adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations.\nInflation\nThe Company does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the volume of customer loans originated, merchandise sales, or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the heavy repayment period of pawn and consumer loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping, and to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company completed its Merger with Cash America, whereby Cash America merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The accompanying audited results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the results of operations for Cash America while the comparable prior-year period includes the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016, affecting comparability of fiscal 2017 and 2016 amounts. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Merger.\nThe Company is a leading operator of retail-based pawn stores with over 2,100 store locations in the U.S. and Latin America. The Company's pawn stores generate significant retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers. The stores also offer pawn loans to help customers meet small short-term cash needs. Personal property, such as consumer electronics, jewelry, power tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments is pledged as collateral for the pawn loans and held by the Company over the term of the loan plus a stated grace\n\nperiod. In addition, some of the Company's pawn stores offer consumer loans or credit services products. The Company's strategy is to focus on growing its retail-based pawn operations in the U.S. and Latin America through new store openings and strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. Pawn operations accounted for approximately 96% of the Company's consolidated revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company organizes its operations into two reportable segments. The U.S. operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in the U.S. and the Latin America operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in Latin America, which currently includes operations in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nThe Company recognizes pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawn loans of which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical redemption statistics. If a pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the property is forfeited to the Company and transferred to inventory at a value equal to the principal amount of the loan, exclusive of accrued pawn fee revenue. The Company records merchandise sales revenue at the time of the sale and presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as income during the period in which final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nThe Company operates a small number of stand-alone consumer finance stores in the U.S. and Mexico. These stores provide consumer financial services products including credit services, consumer loans and check cashing. In addition, 362 of the Company's pawn stores also offer credit services and/or consumer loans as an ancillary product, which products have been deemphasized by the Company in recent years due to regulatory constraints and increased internet based competition for such products. Beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company no longer offers fee-based check cashing services in its non-franchised stores. Consumer loan and credit services revenue accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company recognizes service fee income on consumer loan transactions on a constant-yield basis over the life of the loan and recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. Changes in the valuation reserve on consumer loans and credit services transactions are charged or credited to the consumer loan credit loss provision. The credit loss provision associated with the Company's CSO Programs and consumer loans is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends, delinquency rates, economic conditions and management's expectations of future credit losses.\nStores included in the same-store calculations presented in this annual report are those stores that were opened or acquired prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period and remained open through the end of the reporting period. Also included are stores that were relocated during the year within a specified distance serving the same market where there is not a significant change in store size and where there is not a significant overlap or gap in timing between the opening of the new store and the closing of the existing store. Unless otherwise noted, same-store calculations exclude the results of the merged Cash America stores. Legacy Cash America same-store calculations refer to Cash America stores that were opened prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative fiscal period (although not then owned by the Company) and remained open through the end of the reporting period.\nOperating expenses consist of all items directly related to the operation of the Company's stores, including salaries and related payroll costs, rent, utilities, facilities maintenance, advertising, property taxes, licenses, supplies and security. Administrative expenses consist of items relating to the operation of the corporate offices, including the compensation and benefit costs of corporate management, area supervisors and other operations management personnel, collection operations and personnel, accounting and administrative costs, information technology costs, liability and casualty insurance, outside legal and accounting fees and stockholder-related expenses. Merger and other acquisition expenses primarily include incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\n\nThe following table details income statement items as a percent of total revenue and other operating metrics:\n\n(1) Pre-tax operating profit is an amount equal to net revenues less store operating expenses less store depreciation expense.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenue and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates. The significant accounting policies that the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following:\nCustomer loans and revenue recognition - Receivables on the balance sheet consist of pawn loans and consumer loans. Pawn loans are collateralized by pledged tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan plus a stated grace period. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics. The typical pawn loan term is generally 30 days plus an additional grace period of 14 to 90 days depending on geographical markets and local regulations. Pawn loans may be either paid in full with accrued pawn loan fees and service charges or, where permitted by law, may be renewed\n\nor extended by the customer's payment of accrued pawn loan fees and service charges. If the pawn is not repaid upon expiration of the grace period, the principal amount loaned becomes the carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value.\nThe Company's pawn merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company acquires pawn merchandise inventory through forfeited pawn loans and through purchases of used goods directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free layaway plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as retail merchandise sales revenue when the final payment is received or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Some jewelry is processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the precious metals to the buyer.\nThe Company accrues consumer loan service fees on a constant-yield basis over the term of the consumer loan. Consumer loans have terms that typically range from 7 to 365 days. The Company recognizes credit services fees ratably over the life of the extension of credit made by the Independent Lenders. The extensions of credit made by the Independent Lenders to credit services customers typically have terms of 7 to 365 days.\nCredit loss provisions - The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on consumer loans on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient to cover estimated losses in the collection of its consumer loans. The allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience, with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics (e.g., average amount financed and term), delinquency levels, collateral values, economic conditions and underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for credit losses is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nThe Company fully reserves or charges off consumer loans once the loan has been classified as delinquent for 60 days. Short-term loans are considered delinquent when payment of an amount due is not made as of the due date. Installment loans are considered delinquent when a customer misses two payments. If a loan is estimated to be uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Recoveries on loans previously charged to the allowance, including the sale of delinquent loans to unaffiliated third parties, are credited to the allowance when collected or when sold to a third party. The Company generally does not accrue interest on delinquent consumer loans. In addition, delinquent consumer loans generally may not be renewed, and if, during its attempt to collect on a delinquent consumer loan, the Company allows additional time for payment through a payment plan or a promise to pay, it is still considered delinquent. Generally, all payments received are first applied against accrued but unpaid interest and fees and then against the principal balance of the loan.\nUnder the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit. The Company is required to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. According to the guarantee, if the borrower defaults on the extension of credit, the Company will pay the Independent Lenders the principal, accrued interest, insufficient funds and late fee, if applicable, all of which the Company records as a component of its credit loss provision. The Company is entitled to seek recovery, directly from its customers, of the amounts it pays the Independent Lenders in performing under the guarantees. The Company records the estimated fair value of the liability in accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of the liability is periodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nInventories - Inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawns and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Inventories from forfeited pawns are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, inventory valuation allowances are established, if necessary, when inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. operations and Latin America operations. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the two-step impairment testing methodology. As described in -Results of Operations-Goodwill Impairment-U.S. Consumer Loan Operations\u201d below, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.9 million during 2015.\nThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names, pawn licenses and franchise agreements related to a check-cashing operation. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nForeign currency transactions - The Company has significant operations in Latin America, where in Mexico and Guatemala the functional currency is the Mexican peso and Guatemalan quetzal, respectively. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date, and the resulting adjustments are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates occurring during the respective fiscal period. Prior to translation, U.S. dollar-denominated transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into their functional currency using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from remeasurement of dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities in Mexico and Guatemala are included in store operating expenses. Deferred taxes are not currently provided on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments as the Company indefinitely reinvests earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.\n\nResults of Operations\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes certain operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. The scrap jewelry generated in Latin America is sold and settled in U.S. dollars and is therefore not affected by foreign currency translation. A small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America are also billed and paid in U.S. dollars which are not affected by foreign currency translation.\nBusiness operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The following table provides exchange rates for the Mexican peso and Guatemalan quetzal for the current and prior year periods:\n\nAmounts presented on a constant currency basis are denoted as such. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional discussion of constant currency operating results.\n\nOperating Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\nU.S. Operations Segment\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans, consumer loans, net and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the U.S. operations segment as of December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n (1) Does not include the off-balance sheet principal portion of active CSO extensions of credit made by independent third-party lenders. These amounts, net of the Company's estimated fair value of its liability for guaranteeing the extensions of credit, totaled $9.3 million and $12.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income of the U.S. operations segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands). Store operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the stores.\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nU.S. retail merchandise sales increased 86% to $717.5 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $386.0 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to fiscal 2016 only including the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 ( Cash America 2016 Partial Period\u201d), as the Merger was completed on September 1, 2016. Same-store retail sales decreased 1% in legacy First Cash stores and decreased 4% in legacy Cash America stores during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 35% during fiscal 2017 compared to a margin of 38% during fiscal 2016, reflecting the impact of historically lower margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory items in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories decreased 23% from $282.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $216.7 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of focused liquidation of aged inventories though promotional discounts and jewelry scrapping. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 6% overall and 7% and 5% in the legacy Cash America stores and legacy First Cash U.S. stores, respectively.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 94% totaling $380.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $195.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees increased 4%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn loan fees decreased 9% during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017 decreased 6% compared to December 31, 2016 and decreased 7% on a same-store basis. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 6%, while legacy Cash America same-store pawn receivables decreased 10% as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The decline in legacy Cash America same-store pawn\n\nreceivables and pawn loan fees was primarily due to the expected impact of reducing the holding period on delinquent pawn loans, optimizing loan-to-value ratios and to a lesser extent, the impact of Hurricane Harvey on pawn receivables in coastal Texas markets.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 150% to $119.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period and an increase in volume due to the clearing of aged inventory in the Cash America stores. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 6% compared to the prior-year margin of 13%, primarily as a result of the typically higher cost basis in scrap jewelry sold by the Cash America stores. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 compared to 2% in fiscal 2016.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 79% to $75.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $41.9 million for fiscal 2016. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 31% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Revenues from consumer lending operations comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 97% to $423.2 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses increased 2% and decreased 3% in the legacy First Cash and Cash America stores, respectively, compared with the prior-year period.\nU.S. store depreciation and amortization increased 77% to $24.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $13.6 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $244.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 19% compared to $148.7 million and 22% in the prior year, respectively. The decline in the segment pre-tax operating margin was primarily due to historically lower operating margins in the Cash America stores and a focus during 2017 on liquidating aged inventory levels in Cash America stores, resulting in lower gross profit margins on retail merchandise sales.\n\nLatin America Operations Segment\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans, consumer loans, net and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the Latin America operations segment as of December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income of the Latin America operations segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands). Store operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the stores.\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nLatin America retail merchandise sales increased 18% (19% on a constant currency basis) to $333.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $283.1 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an 11% increase (12% on a constant currency basis) in same-store retail sales driven by strong retail demand trends, a 47% increase (50% on a constant currency basis) in retail sales in the 166 Maxi Prenda stores located in Mexico (acquired on January 6, 2016 and therefore not included in the same-store figure above) driven by operating synergies as a result of the utilization of the Company's proprietary IT platform and best practice retailing strategies, and the maturation of existing stores. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nInventories in Latin America increased 26% (20% on a constant currency basis) from $47.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $60.0 million at December 31, 2017. Increased inventory levels in the Maxi Prenda stores, which historically carried lower inventory balances than the typical First Cash store, accounted for 22% of the increase with growth from new store openings and the maturation of existing stores accounting for the remainder of the increase.\n\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 11% (13% on a constant currency basis) totaling $130.3 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $116.9 million for fiscal 2016 as a result of the 19% (14% on a constant currency basis) increase in pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in pawn receivables reflects a same-store pawn receivable increase of 17% (12% on a constant currency basis) and new store additions. The increase in same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to strong demand for pawn loans and the maturation of existing stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 45% to $21.6 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to a reduced volume of scrapping activities in the Maxi Prenda stores during fiscal 2016 as those stores were being converted to the Company's proprietary point of sale and loan management system. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 6% (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 22%. The 22% scrap gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 was unusually high due to the 18% decline in the average value of the Mexican peso that year, which effectively lowered the cost of the scrap jewelry (scrap is sold in U.S. dollars but sourced in Mexican pesos). Scrap jewelry profits accounted for approximately 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 14% (15% on a constant currency basis) to $128.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 and same-store operating expenses increased 6% (increased 7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period. The increase in both total and same-store operating expenses was due in large part to increased compensation expense related to incentive pay and wage inflation.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2017 was $116.5 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 24% compared to $104.0 million and 25% in the prior year, respectively.\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles pre-tax operating income of the Company's U.S. operations segment and Latin America operations segment discussed above to consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nCorporate Expenses and Taxes\nAdministrative expenses increased 27% to $122.5 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $96.5 million during fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the Merger and a 36% increase in the weighted-average store count resulting in additional management and supervisory compensation and other support expenses required for such growth. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses decreased from 9% during fiscal 2016 to 7% during fiscal 2017, primarily due to synergies realized from the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $20.8 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger, which were depreciated and amortized during all of fiscal 2017 as compared to the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016 during fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense increased to $24.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $20.3 million for fiscal 2016. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and other acquisition expenses decreased to $9.1 million during fiscal 2017 compared to $36.7 million during fiscal 2016, reflecting the timing of transaction and integration costs related to the Merger. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional details of Merger related expenses.\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased through a tender offer, or otherwise redeemed, its outstanding $200 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $14.1 million. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 16.5%, primarily a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d) in fiscal 2017, as the Company recorded a provisional net one-time tax benefit of $27.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the tax benefit realized as a result of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 32.3% compared to 35.7% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in the adjusted fiscal 2017 effective tax rate as compared to the 2016 effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in certain foreign permanent tax benefits and certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes during fiscal 2016, which increased the 2016 effective tax rate. The Company expects its effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be between 26.5% and 27.5% as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet Income, Adjusted Net Income, Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nThe following table sets forth revenue, net revenue, net income, net income per share, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nGAAP and adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by $0.02 per share due to the year-over-year 1% unfavorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso. Adjusted net income removes certain items from GAAP net income that the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance, such as the non-recurring 2017 net tax benefit from the Tax Act, debt extinguishment costs and Merger and other acquisition expenses, but does not adjust for the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\u201d below.\n\nOperating Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\nU.S. Operations Segment\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans, consumer loans, net and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the U.S. operations segment as of December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n (1) Does not include the off-balance sheet principal portion of active CSO extensions of credit made by independent third-party lenders. These amounts, net of the Company's estimated fair value of its liability for guaranteeing the extensions of credit, totaled $12.1 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income of the U.S. operations segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands). Store operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the stores.\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nU.S. retail merchandise sales increased 96% to $386.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $197.0 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 96% of the increase in retail merchandise sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 38% compared to a margin of 41% during fiscal 2015, reflecting an increased mix of general merchandise inventories compared to jewelry inventories in legacy First Cash stores and the impact of lower margins in the Cash America stores.\nU.S. inventories increased 405% from $56.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $282.9 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to the inclusion of $232.6 million of Cash America inventories partially offset by a 10% decline in legacy First Cash store inventories. Included in the Cash America inventory balance as of December 31, 2016 was $13.5 million of scrap inventories in transit or held in processing locations. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores carrying greater quantities of jewelry merchandise compared to legacy First Cash stores. The increase in inventory aged greater than one year was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America stores, which have historically carried higher aged balances than legacy First Cash stores, partially offset by a decrease in aged inventory at legacy First Cash stores.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan fees increased 107% totaling $195.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $94.8 million for fiscal 2015. Pawn loan receivables in the U.S. as of December 31, 2016 increased 330% compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn loan receivables was due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 101% of the pawn fee increase and 100% of the pawn receivable increase. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn receivables increased 1% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Legacy First Cash same-store pawn loan fees declined 4% in fiscal\n\n2016 compared to fiscal 2015, as a result of a 6% decline in the beginning of year same-store pawn loans. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Cash America stores, which have historically carried a higher percentage of jewelry loans than legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nU.S. wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 146% to $47.7 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $19.4 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, which accounted for 92% of the increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue. The scrap gross profit margin in the U.S. was 13% compared to the prior-year margin of 10%, due primarily to an 8% increase in the average spot price of gold in 2016. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 2% of U.S. net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016 compared to 1% in fiscal 2015.\nConsumer Lending Operations\nService fees from U.S. consumer loans and credit services transactions (collectively, consumer lending operations) increased 63% to $41.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $25.7 million for fiscal 2015. The increase in fees was due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period. Excluding the increase due to the Cash America 2016 Partial Period, consumer loan and credit services fees decreased 29% as the Company continues to de-emphasize consumer lending operations in light of increasing internet-based competition and regulatory constraints. Consumer/payday loan-related products comprised 6% of total U.S. revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to 8% during fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses increased 100% to $215.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $107.9 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger. Same-store operating expenses in the First Cash legacy stores were consistent with the prior-year period.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $148.7 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $81.5 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\n\nLatin America Operations Segment\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans, consumer loans, net and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the Latin America operations segment as of December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income of the Latin America operations segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands). Store operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the stores.\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nLatin America retail merchandise sales increased 12% (31% on a constant currency basis) to $283.1 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $252.3 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the retail revenue contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, which accounted for 53% of the constant currency increase, and a 10% increase in same-store constant currency retail sales. During fiscal 2016, the gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% compared to a margin of 36% on retail merchandise sales during fiscal 2015.\nInventories in Latin America increased 28% (52% on a constant currency basis) from $37.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $47.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was consistent with the growth in store counts from acquisitions and store openings in Latin America and the maturation of existing stores. The shift in the composition of pawn inventory from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry inventories and a lower percentage of general merchandise inventories compared to legacy First Cash stores.\n\nPawn Lending Operations\nPawn loan fees in Latin America increased 16% (35% on a constant currency basis) totaling $116.9 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $100.7 million for fiscal 2015. Latin America pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2016 increased 16% (37% on a constant currency basis) compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in pawn loan fees and pawn receivables was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores, which accounted for 71% of the constant currency increase in pawn loan fees and 63% of the constant currency increase in pawn receivables. While Latin America same-store pawn receivables decreased 8% on a U.S. dollar basis compared to the prior year period, constant currency same-store pawn receivables increased 11%, primarily accounting for the remainder of the constant currency increase in Latin America pawn loan fees and pawn receivables. The shift in the composition of pawn receivables from general merchandise to jewelry was primarily due to the Maxi Prenda stores carrying a higher percentage of jewelry loans compared to legacy First Cash stores.\nWholesale Scrap Jewelry Operations\nLatin America wholesale scrap jewelry revenue, consisting primarily of gold sales, increased 18% to $15.0 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $12.7 million during fiscal 2015. The increase in wholesale scrap jewelry revenue was primarily due to the contribution from the Maxi Prenda stores. The scrap gross profit margin in Latin America was 22% (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year margin of 20%. Scrap jewelry profits accounted for 1% of Latin America net revenue (gross profit) for fiscal 2016, which equaled fiscal 2015.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 13% (30% on a constant currency basis) to $112.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $99.7 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Maxi Prenda acquisition, partially offset by an 18% year-over-year unfavorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso. Same-store operating expenses decreased 9% (increased 6% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for fiscal 2016 was $104.0 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 25% compared to $87.2 million and 24% in the prior year, respectively.\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles pre-tax operating income of the Company's U.S. operations segment and Latin America operations segment discussed above to consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nGoodwill Impairment - U.S. Consumer Loan Operations\nAs a result of the Company's fiscal 2015 goodwill impairment analysis, a $7.9 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded associated with its former U.S. consumer loan operations reporting unit, which is no longer a goodwill reporting unit of the Company.\nCorporate Expenses, Other Income and Taxes\nAdministrative expenses increased to $96.5 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $51.9 million during fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of the Merger and a 49% increase in the weighted-average store count resulting in additional management and supervisory compensation and other support expenses required for such growth, partially offset by an 18% unfavorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso, which reduced comparative administrative expenses in Mexico. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses increased from 7% during fiscal 2015 to 9% during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the Merger and the Maxi Prenda acquisition.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization increased to $7.8 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $3.0 million during fiscal 2015, primarily due to the assumption of $118.2 million in property and equipment and $23.4 million in intangible assets subject to amortization as a result of the Merger.\n\nInterest expense increased to $20.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $16.9 million for fiscal 2015 primarily related to increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility primarily used to pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and other acquisition expenses increased to $36.7 million during fiscal 2016 compared to $2.9 million during fiscal 2015, reflecting transaction and integration costs primarily related to the Merger. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional details of Merger related expenses.\nIn conjunction with the Merger, the Company assumed Cash America's investment in the common stock of Enova International, Inc., a publicly traded company focused on providing online consumer lending products. Subsequent to the Merger, all of the Enova shares were sold in open market transactions which resulted in a net gain on sale of $1.3 million.\nFor fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company's effective federal income tax rates were 35.7% and 30.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain significant Merger related expenses being non-deductible for income tax purposes and, to a lesser extent, the increase in taxable U.S. sourced income due to the Merger, which is subject to a higher tax rate than taxable income sourced in Latin America.\nNet Income, Adjusted Net Income, Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nThe following table sets forth revenue, net revenue, net income, net income per share, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nWhile as-reported GAAP net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2016 declined 1% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year primarily due to Merger and other acquisition expenses, adjusted net income and earnings per share increased 25% and 1%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The smaller increase in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was a result of an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding from the Merger. Adjusted net income removes certain items from GAAP net income that the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance, such as Merger and other acquisition expenses, but does not adjust for the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\u201d below.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were $114.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $287.9 million of available and unused funds under the Company's long-term line of credit with its commercial lenders, $411.0 million in customer loans and fees and service charges receivable and $276.8 million in inventories. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was $79.8 million, which is primarily held in Mexican pesos. The Company had working capital of $721.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and total equity exceeded liabilities by a ratio of 2.5 to 1.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Company completed an offering of $300.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due on June 1, 2024 (the Notes\u201d). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 1, 2017. The Notes were sold to the placement agents as initial purchasers for resale only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the proceeds from the offering to repurchase, or otherwise redeem, its outstanding $200.0 million, 6.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes\u201d), to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and repaying borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The Company capitalized $5.1 million in issuance costs, which consisted primarily of placement agent fees and legal and other professional expenses. The issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the Notes as a component of interest expense and are carried as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its primary revolving bank credit facility. The Notes will permit the Company to make share repurchases of up to $100.0 million with the net proceeds of the Notes and other available funds and to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio ( Net Debt Ratio\u201d) is less than 2.25 to 1. The Net Debt Ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the Notes (the Indenture\u201d) as the ratio of (1) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (2) the Company's consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of December 31, 2017, the Net Debt Ratio was 1.1 to 1, see the table below for additional information on the calculation of the Net Debt Ratio.\nThe Company may redeem the Notes at any time on or after June 1, 2020, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, prior to June 1, 2020, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a make-whole\u201d premium set forth in the Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the Notes prior to June 1, 2020, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 105.375% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon a change of control, noteholders have the right to require the Company to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase or redemption of the 2021 Notes which includes the tender or redemption premiums paid over the outstanding $200.0 million principal amount of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company maintained a line of credit with a group of U.S. based commercial lenders (the 2016 Credit Facility\u201d) in the amount of $400.0 million. In May 2017, the term of the 2016 Credit Facility was extended through September 2, 2022. The calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was also amended to remove share repurchases from the calculation to provide greater flexibility for making future share repurchases and paying cash dividends.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $107.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $5.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Credit Facility, leaving $287.9 million available for future borrowings. The 2016 Credit Facility bears interest, at the Company's option, at either (i) the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (with interest periods of 1 week or 1, 2, 3 or 6 months at the Company's option) plus a fixed spread of 2.5% or (ii) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of 1.5%. The agreement has a LIBOR floor of 0%. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.50% on the average daily unused portion of the 2016 Credit Facility commitment. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facility at December 31, 2017 was 4.00% based on 1 week LIBOR. Under the terms of the 2016 Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The 2016 Credit Facility also contains customary restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consummate acquisitions and similar negative covenants with customary carve-outs and baskets. The Company was\n\nin compliance with the covenants of the 2016 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017, and believes it has the capacity to borrow a substantial portion of the amount available under the 2016 Credit Facility under the most restrictive covenant. During fiscal 2017, the Company made net payments of $153.0 million pursuant to the 2016 Credit Facility.\nIn general, revenue growth is dependent upon the Company's ability to fund the addition of store locations (both de novo openings and acquisitions) and growth in customer loan balances and inventories. In addition to these factors, changes in loan balances, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to the Merger, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new store expansions and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Management believes cash on hand, the borrowings available under its credit facility, anticipated cash generated from operations (including the normal seasonal increases in operating cash flows occurring in the first and fourth quarters) and other current working capital will be sufficient to meet the Company's anticipated capital requirements for its business for at least the next twelve months. Where appropriate or desirable, in connection with the Company's efficient management of its liquidity position, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including the sale of assets, reductions in capital spending, the issuance of debt or equity securities and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory and adjust outflows of cash in its lending practices, gives the Company flexibility to quickly modify its business strategy to increase cash flow from its business, if necessary. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See -Item 1 - Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs such as general corporate purposes, growth initiatives and its stock repurchase program.\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Pursuant to the covenants of the Notes, the Company may make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's Net Debt Ratio is less than 2.25 to 1. Adjusted EBITDA, a component of the Net Debt Ratio, is a non-GAAP measure. See -Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for a calculation of the Net Debt Ratio. \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $123.5 million, or 128%, from $96.9 million for fiscal 2016 to $220.4 million for fiscal 2017, due primarily to an increase in net income of $83.8 million and net changes in certain adjustments and operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the statements of cash flows).\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $27.4 million, or 105%, from net cash used in investing activities of $26.0 million during fiscal 2016 to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.4 million during fiscal 2017. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund pawn store acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. In addition, net cash flows related to fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans are included in investing activities. The Company paid $2.2 million in cash related to acquisitions during fiscal 2017 compared to $29.9 million in fiscal 2016. In addition, the portion of the aggregate Merger consideration paid in cash upon closing of the Merger, net of cash acquired, was $8.3 million during fiscal 2016. The Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn and consumer loans of $40.7 million during fiscal 2017 compared to funding a net increase in loans of $16.1 million during fiscal 2016, and received proceeds of $62.1 million from the sale of approximately six million shares of common stock of Enova International, Inc. during fiscal 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $138.8 million from $58.7 million during fiscal 2016 to $197.5 million during fiscal 2017. Net payments on the Company's credit facility were $153.0 million during fiscal 2017 compared to net borrowings of $202.0 million during fiscal 2016, which was primarily used to pay Merger related expenses and pay off assumed debt in conjunction with the Merger. During fiscal 2017, the Company received $300.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of the Notes and paid $5.3 million in debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the Notes and the extension of the 2016 Credit Facility. Using part of the proceeds from the Notes, the Company repurchased, or otherwise redeemed, the $200.0 million 2021 Notes and paid tender or redemption premiums over the face value of the 2021 Notes and other reacquisition costs of $10.9 million during fiscal 2017. The Company paid $2.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2016 Credit Facility during fiscal 2016. In addition, the Company repaid $6.5 million in peso-denominated debt assumed from the Maxi Prenda acquisition and $232.0 million in debt assumed in conjunction with the Merger during fiscal 2016. The Company repurchased $91.7 million worth of shares of its common stock, realized proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million and paid dividends of $36.8 million during fiscal 2017, compared to dividends paid of $19.8 million during fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Company opened 45 new pawn stores in Latin America, acquired five pawn stores in Latin America, opened two pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired one pawn store in the U.S. The cumulative all-cash purchase price of the 2017 acquisitions was $1.2 million, net of cash acquired and certain post-closing adjustments. During fiscal 2017, the Company also paid $1.0 million of deferred purchase price amounts payable related to prior-year acquisitions. The Company funded $37.1 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2017, of which $11.2 million related to the purchase of real estate primarily at existing stores with the remainder related primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and new store additions. Acquisition purchase prices, real estate purchase prices, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and start-up losses related to new store openings have been primarily funded through cash balances, operating cash flows and the Company's credit facility. The Company's cash flow and liquidity available to fund expansion in 2017 included net cash flow from operating activities of $220.4 million for fiscal 2017.\nThe Company intends to continue expansion primarily through acquisitions and new store openings. For fiscal 2018, the Company expects to add approximately 85 stores, primarily in Latin America, including plans for its first stores in Colombia. Additionally, the Company intends to continue purchasing the real estate from landlords at its existing stores as opportunities arise at attractive prices. Excluding these real estate purchases, the Company expects total capital expenditures for 2018, including expenditures for new and remodeled stores and other corporate assets, to total approximately $27.5 million to $32.5 million. Management believes cash on hand, the amounts available to be drawn under the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the Company's current operations and store expansion plans for 2018.\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential acquisition opportunities. The Company currently has no other contractual commitments for materially significant future acquisitions, business combinations or capital commitments. The Company will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. If the Company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future, the Company may seek additional financing, the terms of which will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\nIn January 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 228,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $10.0 million and an average cost per share of $43.94. In May 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. The new share repurchase program replaced the Company's prior share repurchase plan, which was terminated in May 2017. Under the May 2017 stock repurchase program, the Company has repurchased 1,388,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $83.0 million and an average cost per share of $59.80 and $17.0 million remained available for repurchases as of December 31, 2017. On January 31, 2018, the Company completed the May 2017 stock repurchase program after repurchasing approximately 239,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in 2016 as it suspended its share repurchase program in 2016 due to the Merger.\n\nIn October 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional common stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, which became effective on January 31, 2018 upon completion of the May 2017 stock repurchase program. The Company intends to continue repurchases under its repurchase program in 2018 through open market transactions under trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, the dividend policy and the availability of alternative investment opportunities.\nTotal cash dividends paid in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $36.8 million and $19.8 million, respectively. In January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the annual dividend to $0.88 per share, or $0.22 per share quarterly, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The declared $0.22 first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $10.3 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts, will be paid on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 14, 2018. On an annualized basis, this represents aggregate dividends of $41.2 million based on December 31, 2017 share counts as compared to aggregate dividends of $36.8 million in fiscal 2017. The declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements and debt covenant restrictions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results (as defined or explained below) as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined in SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's operating performance and because management believes they provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and constant currency results, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude, among other expenses and benefits, Merger related expenses because it generally would not incur such costs and expenses as part of its continuing operations. The Merger related expenses are predominantly incremental costs directly associated with the Merger and integration of Cash America, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance and retention payments, accelerated vesting of certain equity compensation awards, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share ( Adjusted Income Measures\u201d) provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Income Measures, which are shown net of tax (unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the gross amounts, the impact of income taxes and the net amounts for each of the adjustments included in the table above (unaudited, in thousands):\n\n (1) Resulting tax benefit for fiscal 2016 is less than the statutory rate as a portion of the transaction costs were not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and interest income and adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items as listed below that management considers to be non-operating in nature and not representative of its actual operating performance. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by investors to assess a company's financial performance and adjusted EBITDA is used in the calculation of the Net Debt Ratio as defined in the Company's senior notes covenants. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) For fiscal 2015, excludes $0.5 million of depreciation and amortization, which is included in the restructuring expenses related to U.S. consumer loan operations. \nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nFor purposes of its internal liquidity assessments, the Company considers free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and net fundings/repayments of pawn and consumer loans, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities, and adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for Merger related expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles net cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Includes $11.2 million, $13.4 million and $3.6 million of real estate expenditures primarily at existing stores for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP measurement of financial performance. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide investors with valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico and Guatemala are transacted in Mexican pesos and Guatemalan quetzales, respectively. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America operations segment tables in -Results of Operations\u201d above for an additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nContractual Commitments\nA tabular disclosure of contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Excludes interest obligations under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facility. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company offers a fee-based credit services organization program to assist consumers in obtaining extensions of credit. The Company's stand-alone consumer loan stores and select pawn stores in the states of Texas and Ohio offer the CSO Programs. The Company's CSO Programs comply with the respective jurisdiction's credit services organization act, credit access business law or a similar statute. Under the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from the Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit.\n\nFor extension of credit products originated by the Independent Lenders, the Independent Lenders are responsible for evaluating each of its customers' applications, determining whether to approve an extension of credit based on an application and determining the amount of the extension of credit. The Company is not involved in the Independent Lenders' extension of credit approval processes or in determining the Independent Lenders' approval procedures or criteria. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding amount of active extensions of credit originated and held by the Independent Lenders was $9.7 million.\nSince the Company may not be successful in collection of delinquent accounts under the CSO Programs, the Company's consumer loan loss provision includes amounts estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit in the aggregate consumer loan portfolio, including those expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations. Estimated losses of $0.4 million on portfolios owned by the Independent Lenders are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes this amount is adequate to absorb credit losses from extensions of credit expected to be assigned to the Company or acquired by the Company as a result of its guaranty obligations.\nInflation\nThe Company does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the volume of customer loans originated, merchandise sales, or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the heavy repayment period of pawn and consumer loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping, and to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_tables":

2015. \n\n- FirstCash operates pawn stores and consumer lending locations in the U.S. and Latin America. The company completed a merger with Cash America in September 2016, significantly expanding its U.S. operations.\n\n- In 2017, total revenue increased 63% to $1.78 billion, primarily due to a full year of Cash America operations. Net income increased 139% to $143.9 million.\n\n- The U.S. operations segment accounted for 73% of total revenue in 2017. Retail sales, pawn fees, and scrap jewelry sales all had strong growth compared to 2016 due to the Cash America merger.\n\n- The Latin America operations segment had revenue growth of 17%, driven by same-store sales growth and maturation of stores. Pawn loans and inventories increased significantly.\n\n- FirstCash focused on integrating the Cash America operations, including liquidating aged inventories which impacted retail margins. The company also reduced its consumer lending operations.\n\n- In 2017, FirstCash issued $300 million in senior notes and repaid/redeemed $200 million in existing senior notes. The company repurchased $91.7 million in common stock.\n\n- FirstCash generated $220.4 million in operating cash flow in 2017, up 128% versus 2016.
