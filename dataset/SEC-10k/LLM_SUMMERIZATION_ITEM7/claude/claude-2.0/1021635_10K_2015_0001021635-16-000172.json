Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and has the ability to exercise significant influence.\nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nThe natural gas midstream operations segment currently represents the Company's investment in Enable through its wholly owned subsidiary OGE Holdings. Enable is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Bakken shale formation, principally located in the Williston basin of North Dakota. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois. For periods prior to the formation of Enable, the natural gas midstream operations segment reflected the consolidated results of Enogex Holdings.\nEnable was formed effective May 1, 2013 by the Company, the ArcLight group and CenterPoint to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. In the formation transaction, the Company and the ArcLight group contributed Enogex LLC to Enable and the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired an equity interest in Enable. The Company's contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable met the requirements of being in substance real estate and was recorded at historical cost. The general partner of Enable is equally controlled by CenterPoint and OGE Energy, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, effective May 1, 2013, the Company began accounting for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting.\nIn April 2014, Enable completed an initial public offering of 25,000,000 common units resulting in Enable becoming a publicly traded Master Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 111.0 million limited partner units, or 26.3 percent, of which 68.2 million limited partner units were subordinated.\nOn January 22, 2016, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.3180 per unit on its outstanding common and subordinated units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. Based on current commodity prices, Enable has seen changes in producer activity that have negatively impacted Enable's operations and financial position and could see additional changes in producer activity that may negatively impact Enable's operations and affect its future distribution rates. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. OGE Holdings is entitled to 60 percent of those incentive distributions.\u201d\nOG&E began participating in the SPP Integrated Marketplace effective March 1, 2014. The SPP Integrated Marketplace replaced the SPP Energy Imbalance Services market. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP assumed balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations, and determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nOverview\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nOG&E is focused on:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve.

The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of three to five percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. The Company also relies on cash distributions from its investment in Enable to fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nSummary of Operating Results\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income attributable to OGE Energy was $271.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to $395.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to OGE Energy of $124.5 million, or 31.5 percent, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $92.9 million, or 90.8 percent, or $0.46 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to the goodwill impairment adjustment at Enable in September 2015 and lower revenues driven by lower average natural gas and NGLs prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in net income at OGE Energy of $8.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to charges associated with pre-construction expenditures for new office space to consolidate Oklahoma City personnel; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in net income at OG&E of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues.

OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOGE Enogex Holdings LLC\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable Midstream to be approximately $56 million to $66 million or $0.28 to $0.33 per average diluted share.\nConsolidated OGE\nThe Company's 2016 earnings guidance is between approximately $344 million and $366 million of net income, or $1.72 to $1.83 per average diluted share and is based on the following assumptions:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>approximately 200 million average diluted shares outstanding; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOngoing Earnings and Ongoing Earnings per Average Diluted Share are defined by the Company as GAAP Earnings and GAAP Earnings per Average Diluted Share adjusted to exclude non-cash charges. These financial measures excluded non-cash charges of approximately $108.4 million or $0.33 per average diluted share associated with the Company's share of Enable's goodwill impairment as well as a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $5.8 million or $0.02 per average diluted share. The Company's management believes that ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results and are more representative of the Company's fundamental core earnings power. The Company's management uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Gross Margin to Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in Millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n(A)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the Company's consolidated financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

As a result, when Enable performed the first step of its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2015, it determined that the carrying value of the gathering and processing and transportation and storage segments exceeded fair value. Enable completed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis comparing the implied fair value for those reporting units to the carrying amount of that goodwill and determined that goodwill for those units was completely impaired in the amount of $1,086.4 million as of September 30, 2015.

Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49.0 percent coal, 44.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61.0 percent coal, 32.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.

Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations)\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (A)\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to OGE Holdings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>In September 2015, the Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis difference.

Prior to May 1, 2013, the Company reported the results of Enogex Holdings in the natural gas midstream operations segment.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes OGE Energy's share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of OGE Energy's original investment in Enogex LLC and its underlying equity in net assets of Enable. The basis difference is the result of the initial contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable in May 2013, and subsequent issuances of equity by Enable, including the initial public offering in April 2014 and the issuance of common units for the acquisition of CenterPoint's 24.95 percent interest in SESH. The basis difference is being amortized over approximately 30 years, the average life of the assets to which the basis difference is attributed. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is also adjusted for the elimination of the Enogex Holdings fair value adjustments.\nThe difference between OGE Energy's investment in Enable and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable was $783.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nReconciliation of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table reconciles OGE Energy's equity in earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE's share of Enable Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of basis difference\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of Enogex Holdings fair value and other adjustments\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table represents summarized financial information of Enable for 2014 and 2015:\nEnable Results of Operations\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe table set forth below illustrates the impact of the operating results of Enable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (A)\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to OGE Holdings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>The Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge during the third quarter of 2015 for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis differences.

In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's gathering and processing business segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily from a decrease in gross margin, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in taxes other than income taxes. Gathering and processing gross margin decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices partially offset by increased volumes in the Anadarko and Williston basins. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's transportation and storage segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily due to lower margin on unrealized natural gas derivatives, a decrease in sales of NGLs due to lower prices, lower firm transportation revenues, a decrease in storage demand fees as well as lower rates on transportation services for local distribution companies and increased depreciation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins related to realized gains on system optimization activities and increased margins from higher rates on off-system transportation services.\nOver the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Should lower commodity prices persist, or should commodity prices decline further, Enable's future operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax benefit was $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to an expense of $69.1 million in 2014, a decrease in expense of $70.1 million primarily due to lower pre-tax operating income, a benefit recognized associated with a remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Company's investment in Enable and the impact of the goodwill impairment on Enable.\nOperating Data\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathered volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>4.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas processed volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGLs sold - million gallons/d (A)(B)\n</td> <td>75.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Excludes condensate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>NGLS sold includes volumes of NGLS withdrawn from inventory or purchased for system balancing purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDue to deconsolidation of Enogex LLC on May 1, 2013, the Company recorded no operating income for this segment for the eight-month period from May 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 or the year ended December 31, 2014.

OGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $38.0 million, or 28.5 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period of 2013. The increase reflects the accretive effect to OGE Holdings of Enable, for the entire year of 2014, as compared to only eight months of 2013, following the formation of Enable on May 1, 2013. Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013, due to increased gathering and processing margins as a result of higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex basins (which offset lower gathering volumes) and higher crude oil gathering margins. Additionally, Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 due to higher transportation and storage margins as a result of an increase of unrealized gains on natural gas derivatives and an increase of system optimization activities. The higher margins were offset in part, by higher depreciation expenses resulting from assets being placed in service and higher operating and maintenance expenses. Finally, as a result of Enable's initial public offering in April 2014, and CenterPoint's exercising of its put right to Enable, for its 24.95 percent interest in SESH, OGE Energy's ownership in Enable dropped from 28.5 percent at the beginning of 2014 to 26.3 percent by the end of 2014, further partially offsetting the increase in earnings before taxes.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $69.1 million in 2014 as compared to $26.9 million in 2013, an increase of $42.2 million primarily due to higher pre-tax income and higher tax expense as compared to the prior period due to the absence of favorable deferred tax adjustments related to the formation of Enable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents was $75.2 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $69.7 million, primarily due to normal business operations and the quarterly distributions received from Enable.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $228.3 million and $249.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $21.6 million, or 8.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nIncome Taxes Receivable. The balance of Income Taxes Receivable was $17.2 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million,or 7.5 percent, primarily due to a receivable related to Oklahoma wind credits and overpayments refundable from Louisiana.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Tax. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $191.4 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel\nand purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nOther Current Assets. The balance of Other Current Assets was $55.6 million and $38.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $17.2 million, or 44.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in recoverable demand portfolio program costs.\nShort-Term Debt. Short-Term Debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98 million at December 31, 2014, due to a payoff of all short-term debt.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $262.5 million and $179.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $83.4 million, or 46.6 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $54.4 million and $38.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $16.2 million, or 42.4 percent, primarily resulting from the reclassification of retirement restoration payable in the second quarter of 2016 to accrued compensation as well as lower levels of accrued incentive compensation for 2014.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014 due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>721.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(500.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(559.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(957.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>397.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash (Used in) Provided from Financing Activities\n</td> <td>(295.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(163.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>338.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(80.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(502.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $143.8 million, or 19.9 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries at OG&E and less cash paid to vendors, partially offset by Enable distributions classified as a return of capital in investing activities.\nThe increase of $98.4 million, or 15.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase in cash distributions received from Enable in excess of cash distributions and cash provided from the operating activities of Enogex Holdings in 2013;

Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table.

On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrecovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving the Company's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015.

OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 12\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Plan\n</td> <td>Restoration of Retirement\nIncome Plan\n</td> <td>Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>581.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(170.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(221.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, the Company experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, the Company recorded pension settlement charges of $16.2 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by the Company and did not increase the Company's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. The Company's financial objective includes dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. At the Company's September 2015 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.27500 per share from $0.25000 per share effective in October 2015.\nSecurity Ratings\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Services\n</td> <td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Services\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>P2\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>F2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $548.0 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $85.6 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $633.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $809.5 million and net contractual obligations of $88.2 million totaling $897.7 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, the Company's sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt, proceeds from other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling in the aggregate $1,150.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. Short-term debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98.0 million at December 31, 2014. The average balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $75.2 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.46 percent. The maximum month-end balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $180.0 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,148.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreements. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31,\n2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $75.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements to total in the aggregate $1,150.0 million ($750.0 million for the Company and $400.0 million for OG&E). Each of the credit facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company and OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of their credit agreements from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company and OG&E utilized their second extension to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, commitments of approximately $16.3 million and $8.7 million of the Company's and OG&E's credit facilities, respectively, however, were not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, such commitments will expire December 13, 2017.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2016 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nDistributions by Enable\nPursuant to the Enable limited partnership agreement, the amount of distributions the Company received from Enable were $139.3 million and $143.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised for all Company segments includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Company's Audit Committee. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>Impact on Funded Status\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual plan asset returns\n</td> <td>+/- 1 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $5.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $14.1 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions\n</td> <td>+/- $10 million\n</td> <td>+/- $10.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18, 2010, Oklahoma submitted its SIP to the EPA, which set forth the state's plan for compliance with the Federal regional haze rule. The SIP was subject to the EPA's review and approval.\nThe Oklahoma SIP included requirements for reducing emissions of NOX and SO2 from OG&E's seven BART-eligible units at the Seminole, Muskogee and Sooner generating stations. The SIP also included a waiver from BART requirements for all eligible units at the Horseshoe Lake generating station based on air modeling that showed no significant impact on visibility in nearby national parks and wilderness areas. The SIP concluded that BART for reducing NOX emissions at all of the subject units should be the installation of low NOX burners with overfired air (flue gas recirculation was also required on two of the units) and set forth associated NOX emission rates and limits.\nOn December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule in which it rejected the SO2 portion of the Oklahoma SIP and issued a FIP in its place. OG&E and the State of Oklahoma's subsequent appeal of the FIP with the Tenth Circuit of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court ended on May 27, 2014 when the Supreme Court denied OG&E's Petition for Certiorari, upholding the EPA's FIP for SO2. The FIP compliance date is now January 4, 2019.\nOn December 9, 2015, the EPA released a final rule partially disapproving the revisions to the 2010 Oklahoma SIP for Regional Haze and promulgated FIPs in their place for Oklahoma and Texas. The EPA disapproved portions of the Oklahoma SIP related to the establishment of Reasonable Progress Goals for the Class I area located within the state and promulgated revised Reasonable Progress Goals based on the FIP implementation in Texas. As a result, no further requirements are required in Oklahoma to meet the 2018 Reasonable Progress Goals for Oklahoma.\nOn August 6, 2014, OG&E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application seeks approval of the environmental compliance plan and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asked the OCC to predetermine the prudence of replacing OG&E's soon-to-be retired Mustang steam turbines in late 2017 with 400 MWs of new, efficient combustion turbines at the Mustang site in 2018 and 2019 and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. OG&E estimates the total capital cost associated with its environmental compliance plan included in this application to be approximately $1.1 billion. The OCC hearing on OG&E's application before an ALJ began on March 3, 2015 and concluded on April 8, 2015. Multiple parties advocating a variety of positions intervened in the proceeding.\nOn June 8, 2015, the ALJ issued his report on OG&E's application. While the ALJ in his report agreed that the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas pursuant to OG&E's ECP is the best approach, the ALJ's report included several recommendations. OG&E filed exceptions to the ALJ's report and on July 21, 2015, Commissioner Bob Anthony issued his deliberation statement that was consistent with many parts of the ALJ's report, including the ALJ's support of OG&E's ECP, the ALJ's recommendation to pre-approve certain estimated costs of the environmental recovery plan, and the ALJ's recommendation to defer all other cost recovery issues until the next general rate case.\nOn December 2, 2015, OG&E received an order from the OCC denying, by a two to one vote, its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider.\nOn December 11, 2015, OG&E filed a motion requesting modification of the OCC order for the purposes of approving only the ECP. OG&E did not seek modification to any other provisions of the OCC order, including cost recovery. OG&E also agreed that it would not implement a rider for recovery of the costs of the ECP until and unless authorized by the OCC in a subsequent proceeding.\nOn December 23, 2015, the OCC rejected, by a two to one vote, a proposal by Commissioner Dana Murphy to grant OG&E's December 11, 2015 motion.\nOn February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the United States to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. In December 2011, the EPA published a supplemental CSAPR, which would make six additional states, including Oklahoma, subject to the CSAPR for NOX emissions during the ozone-season from May 1 through September 30. Under the rule, OG&E would have been required to reduce ozone-season NOX emissions from its electrical generating units within the state beginning in 2012. In response to legal challenges of the final rule on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule, which includes the supplemental rule, pending a decision on the merits. By order dated August 21, 2012, the Court of Appeals vacated the CSAPR and ordered the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals. On October 23, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the EPA's request that the court lift the stay of the CSAPR. The EPA subsequently clarified that compliance with the CSAPR would begin in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E has installed five low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and one Seminole unit and is in compliance with the final rule. In the meantime, the petitions\nfor review of the supplemental rule remain pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of issues that are not addressed by the Supreme Court's decision.\nOn December 3, 2015, the EPA proposed an update to CSAPR finding that ozone-season NOX emissions in 23 eastern states including Oklahoma affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain ozone standards and proposing to issue FIPs to update the existing NOX ozone-season emission budgets for electrical generating units. The proposed rule reduces OG&E's NOX emissions requirements under the current CSAPR by 25 percent. Compliance is proposed to begin in May 2017. OG&E continues to evaluate what additional measures, if any, will be needed for compliance with the new rule.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The final rule uses a numerical standard to establish limits for particulate matter (as a surrogate for toxic metals), hydrogen chloride and mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. Compliance was required within three years of the rule's effective date. Based on OG&E's request for a one-year extension, the deadline for compliance was extended to April 16, 2016. To comply with this rule, OG&E utilized activated carbon injections at each of its five coal-fired units during 2015.\nThe final MATS rule was appealed by several parties, but OG&E was not a party to the appeals. After withstanding judicial scrutiny at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, the MATS rule was challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs imposed on utilities at the first stage of the EPA's regulatory analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the rule, but reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. The MATS rule currently remains in effect and OG&E is still required to meet the April 2016 compliance deadline.\nFederal Clean Air Act New Source Review Litigation\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, OG&E received a request for information from the EPA regarding Federal Clean Air Act compliance at OG&E's Muskogee and Sooner generating plants.\nOn July 8, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against OG&E in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E did not follow the Federal Clean Air Act procedures for projecting emission increases attributable to eight projects that occurred between 2003 and 2006. This complaint seeks to have OG&E submit a new assessment of whether the projects were likely to result in a significant emissions increase. The Sierra Club intervened in this proceeding. On August 30, 2013, the government filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and on September 6, 2013, OG&E filed a Motion to Dismiss the case. On January 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGuisti dismissed the complaints filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club. The Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims because plaintiffs failed to present an actual case or controversy\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court also ruled in the alternative that, even if plaintiffs had presented a case or controversy, it would have nonetheless decline[d] to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d The EPA and the Sierra Club did not file an appeal of the Court's ruling.\nOn August 12, 2013, the Sierra Club filed a separate complaint against OG&E in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E projects at Muskogee Unit 6 in 2008 were made without obtaining a prevention of significant deterioration permit and that the plant had exceeded emissions limits for opacity and particulate matter. The Sierra Club seeks a permanent injunction preventing OG&E from operating the Muskogee generating plant. On March 4, 2014, the Eastern District dismissed the prevention of significant deterioration permit claim based on the statute of limitations, but allowed the opacity and particulate matter claims to proceed. To obtain the right to appeal this decision, the Sierra Club subsequently withdrew a Notice of Intent to Sue for additional Clean Air Act violations and asked the Eastern District to dismiss its remaining claims with prejudice. On August 27, 2014, the Eastern District granted the Sierra Club's request. The Sierra Club has filed a Notice of Appeal with the 10th Circuit where oral argument was held on March 18, 2015.\nAt this time, OG&E continues to believe that it has acted in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act, and OG&E expects to vigorously defend against the claims that have been asserted. If OG&E does not prevail in the remainder of the proceedings, the EPA and the Sierra Club could seek to require OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment, including dry scrubbers, baghouses and selective catalytic reduction systems with capital costs in excess of $1.1 billion and pay fines and significant penalties as a result of the allegations in the notice of violation. Section 113 of the Federal Clean Air Act (along with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1996) provides for civil penalties as much as $37,500 per day for each violation. Due to the uncertain and preliminary nature of this litigation, OG&E cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss in this case.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of the end of 2015, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS. The Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nIn August of 2013, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a complaint under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Air Act based on the EPA's failure to promulgate and publish designations for the 2010 revised primary SO2 NAAQS. On March 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order granting the EPA and the Sierra Club's joint motion to approve and enter a consent decree that set forth mandatory deadlines for the EPA to issue designations for all areas of the country that remained undesignated. On September 18, 2015 the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality reported to the EPA that no areas in Oklahoma should be designated as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 standard. This non-attainment designation is subject to the EPA's approval. In a letter dated February 11, 2016, EPA Region 6 notified Oklahoma of their intent to designate part of Muskogee County in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. EPA is expected to finalize this designation in July, 2016 following public comment. This could require additional controls scrubbers on the affected units. On August 21, 2015, EPA finalized a data requirements rule for implementing the 2010 SO2 standard requiring air agencies to characterize air quality around sources that emit 2,000 tons per year or more of SO2 via air quality modeling or ambient air monitoring. In July 2016, air agencies will be required to identify either ambient monitoring or air quality modeling as a method for characterizing air quality for 2,000 tons per year or larger sources. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether this determination will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nOn September 30, 2015 the EPA finalized a new ambient standard for ozone at 70 ppb which is more stringent than the current standard of 75 ppb, set in 2008. States must submit non-attainment designations as appropriate based on existing ambient data before October 2016 for the EPA's approval. Compliance with the new standard begins in 2020 or later depending on the degree of the area's non-attainment designation. All areas in Oklahoma currently meet the new standard.\nThe Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nClean Power Plan\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs/MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr) goals. The 2030 rate-based reduction requirement for all existing generating units in Oklahoma has decreased from a proposed 43 percent reduction to 32 percent in the final rule. The mass-based approach for existing units calls for a 24 percent reduction by 2030 in Oklahoma. The Clean Power Plan requires that states submit to the EPA plans for achieving the state-specific CO2 reduction goals by September 6, 2016 or submit an extension request for up to two years. The compliance period was to begin in 2022, and emission reductions were to be phased in by 2030. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that an approvable state plan was not submitted to the EPA by the required deadline.\nA number of states have filed lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of challenges to the rule. The Company is unable to determine what impact the lawsuits will ultimately have on the Clean Power Plan or what impact the stay in implementation will have; however, if the Clean Power Plan survives judicial review and is implemented as written, it could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Significant uncertainties would remain with regards to potential implementation in Oklahoma (and the federal plan that would be imposed by the EPA for states that do not submit approvable plans), including whether states would elect an emissions standards approach versus a state measures approach, whether and what type of emissions trading would be allowed, and available cost mitigation options. Due to the pending litigation and the uncertainties in the state approaches, the ultimate timing and impact of these standards on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. In December 2015, as part of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States committed to reduce economy wide emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 emission levels. This multinational agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and \"represent a progression\" every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement could result in future additional emissions reductions in the United States, however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which commitments under the December 2015 Paris Agreement will be implemented through the Clean Air Act, other than existing statutes and new legislation.\nSeveral states have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nIn 2009, the EPA adopted a comprehensive national system for reporting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases produced by major sources in the United States. The reporting requirements apply to large direct emitters of greenhouse gases with emissions equal to or greater than a threshold of 25,000 metric tons per year, which includes certain OG&E facilities. OG&E also reports quarterly its CO2 emissions from generating units subject to the Federal Acid Rain Program. OG&E has submitted the reports required by the applicable reporting rules.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d, OG&E has filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP by converting two coal-fired generating units at Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E also seeks to utilize renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas. OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource area in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nEPA Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction Policy\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the outdated provisions in the SIP of 36 states, including Oklahoma, regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy to assure consistency with the Clean Air Act and other recent court decisions. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality is in the process of developing a SIP to comply with this rule, which is to be submitted to the EPA before November 2016. Although the extent of impact is not known, this rule will impact certain OG&E units.\nEndangered Species\nCertain Federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which the Company conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, the Company's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or the Company could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nIn 2014, the Company enrolled in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies range-wide conservation plan which consists of industry-specific conservation practices that apply to projects and activities in the impacted area. The range-wide\nconservation plan was approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and incorporated as part of the agency's final decision on March 27, 2014 to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. On September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court Western District of Texas vacated federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's failure to thoroughly consider the active conservation efforts in making the listing decision.\nAir Quality Control System\nOn September 10, 2014, OG&E executed a contract for the design, engineering and fabrication of two circulating dry scrubber systems to be installed at Sooner Units 1 and 2. OG&E entered into an agreement on February 9, 2015, to install the dry scrubber systems. The dry scrubbers are part of OG&E's ECP and scheduled to be completed by 2019. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under the Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d section of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWaste\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nOn December 19, 2014, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The final rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. OG&E has evaluated the potential impacts of the final rule on our ash ponds and has set up a reserve based on a reasonable estimate.\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2015, the Company obtained refunds of $2.3 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nWater\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and Federal waters.\nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014. OG&E submitted compliance plans to the state in April 2015. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation.\nSite Remediation\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generate wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and regulations, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and has the ability to exercise significant influence.\nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nThe natural gas midstream operations segment currently represents the Company's investment in Enable through its wholly owned subsidiary OGE Holdings. Enable is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Bakken shale formation, principally located in the Williston basin of North Dakota. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois. For periods prior to the formation of Enable, the natural gas midstream operations segment reflected the consolidated results of Enogex Holdings.\nEnable was formed effective May 1, 2013 by the Company, the ArcLight group and CenterPoint to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. In the formation transaction, the Company and the ArcLight group contributed Enogex LLC to Enable and the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired an equity interest in Enable. The Company's contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable met the requirements of being in substance real estate and was recorded at historical cost. The general partner of Enable is equally controlled by CenterPoint and OGE Energy, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, effective May 1, 2013, the Company began accounting for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting.\nIn April 2014, Enable completed an initial public offering of 25,000,000 common units resulting in Enable becoming a publicly traded Master Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 111.0 million limited partner units, or 26.3 percent, of which 68.2 million limited partner units were subordinated.\nOn January 22, 2016, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.3180 per unit on its outstanding common and subordinated units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. Based on current commodity prices, Enable has seen changes in producer activity that have negatively impacted Enable's operations and financial position and could see additional changes in producer activity that may negatively impact Enable's operations and affect its future distribution rates. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. OGE Holdings is entitled to 60 percent of those incentive distributions.\u201d\nOG&E began participating in the SPP Integrated Marketplace effective March 1, 2014. The SPP Integrated Marketplace replaced the SPP Energy Imbalance Services market. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP assumed balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations, and determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nOverview\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity. \n \u2022 Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve. A particular focus is on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments. \n \u2022 Maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members. \n \u2022 Continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results. \n \u2022 Complying with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze requirements. \n \u2022 Ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers. \n \u2022 Continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nAdditionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of three to five percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. The Company also relies on cash distributions from its investment in Enable to fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nSummary of Operating Results\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income attributable to OGE Energy was $271.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to $395.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to OGE Energy of $124.5 million, or 31.5 percent, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $92.9 million, or 90.8 percent, or $0.46 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to the goodwill impairment adjustment at Enable in September 2015 and lower revenues driven by lower average natural gas and NGLs prices; \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OGE Energy of $8.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to charges associated with pre-construction expenditures for new office space to consolidate Oklahoma City personnel; and \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OG&E of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in customer growth, an increase in other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction. \n2014 compared to 2013. Net income attributable to OGE Energy was $395.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2014 as compared to $387.6 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, in 2013. The increase in net income attributable to OGE Energy of $8.2 million, or 2.1 percent, or $0.04 per diluted share, in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in net income at OGE Holdings of $2.4 million, or 2.4 percent, or $0.01 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, due partially to the accretive effect to OGE Holdings of Enable partially offset by a reduction in deferred state income taxes in 2013 associated with a remeasurement of the accumulated deferred taxes related to the formation of Enable; \n \u2022 an increase in net income at OGE Energy of $6.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to decreased transaction expenses related to the formation of Enable and a decrease in losses for the deferred compensation plan; and \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OG&E of $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, or $0.01 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, reflecting an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2014, a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather compared to 2013, an increase in other operation and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in wholesale transmission revenues, an increase in customer growth and a decrease in incentive compensation. \nA more detailed discussion regarding the financial performance of OG&E and the Natural Gas Midstream Operations can be found under \"Results of Operations\" below.\n2016 Outlook\nKey assumptions for 2016 include:\nOG&E\nThe Company projects OG&E to earn approximately $288 million to $300 million or $1.44 to $1.50 per average diluted share in 2016 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma in mid 2016; \n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.405 billion to $1.415 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n \u2022 approximately $106 million of gross margin is primarily attributed to regionally allocated transmission projects; \n \u2022 operating expenses of approximately $885 million to $895 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising 54 percent of the total; \n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $140 million which assumes a $8 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense; \n \u2022 other income of approximately $27 million including approximately $15 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent. \nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOGE Enogex Holdings LLC\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable Midstream to be approximately $56 million to $66 million or $0.28 to $0.33 per average diluted share.\nConsolidated OGE\nThe Company's 2016 earnings guidance is between approximately $344 million and $366 million of net income, or $1.72 to $1.83 per average diluted share and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 approximately 200 million average diluted shares outstanding; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOngoing Earnings and Ongoing Earnings per Average Diluted Share are defined by the Company as GAAP Earnings and GAAP Earnings per Average Diluted Share adjusted to exclude non-cash charges. These financial measures excluded non-cash charges of approximately $108.4 million or $0.33 per average diluted share associated with the Company's share of Enable's goodwill impairment as well as a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $5.8 million or $0.02 per average diluted share. The Company's management believes that ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results and are more representative of the Company's fundamental core earnings power. The Company's management uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Reconciliations of ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are below.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Ongoing Earnings (Loss) to GAAP Earnings (Loss)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Net of tax, in millions)\n</td> <td>2015 GAAP Earnings (Loss)\n</td> <td>Goodwill and Pension Settlement Charges (A)\n</td> <td>2015 Ongoing Earnings (Loss)\n</td> <td>2014 GAAP and Ongoing Earnings (Loss) (B)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>292.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Midstream Operations\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holding Company\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>342.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>395.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Ongoing Earnings (Loss) per Average Diluted Share to GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Average Diluted Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015 GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share\n</td> <td>Goodwill and Pension Settlement Charges per Share (A)\n</td> <td>2015 Ongoing Earnings (Loss) per Share\n</td> <td>2014 GAAP and Ongoing Earnings (Loss) per Share (B)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural Gas Midstream Operations\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holding Company\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.04\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) On September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $108.4 million or $0.33 per average diluted share for its portion of Enable's goodwill impairment. Additionally, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $5.8 million or $0.02 per average diluted share for a pension settlement charge related to Enable. \n (B) There were no similar charges for the year ended December 31, 2014, therefore ongoing earnings and GAAP earnings are the same. \nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors.

As a result, when Enable performed the first step of its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2015, it determined that the carrying value of the gathering and processing and transportation and storage segments exceeded fair value. Enable completed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis comparing the implied fair value for those reporting units to the carrying amount of that goodwill and determined that goodwill for those units was completely impaired in the amount of $1,086.4 million as of September 30, 2015. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge during the third quarter of 2015 for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis differences. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \n (B) Other Operations primarily includes the operations of the holding company and consolidating eliminations. \nThe following

If the calculated average is above 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as cooling degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period. \n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E's net income decreased $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense and lower gross margin partially offset by higher other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used in construction.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,196.9 million in 2015 as compared to $2,453.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $256.2 million, or 10.4 percent. Cost of sales were $865.0 million in 2015 as compared to $1,106.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $241.6 million, or 21.8 percent. Gross margin was $1,331.9 million in 2015 as compared to $1,346.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 1.1 percent.

Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49.0 percent coal, 44.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61.0 percent coal, 32.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. The OCC, the APSC and the FERC have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees OG&E pays to its affiliate, Enable.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $444.5 million in 2015 as compared to $453.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 1.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional capitalized labor (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance at power plants (B)\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional service contracts (C)\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits (D)\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other marketing, sales and commercial (E)\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and wages (F)\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other operation and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Decreased primarily due to more capital projects and storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to less work at the power plants. \n (C) Decreased primarily due to decreased engineering services. \n (D) Increased primarily due to higher medical costs incurred partially offset by lower pension costs. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher demand side management customer payments. \n (F) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and increased overtime related to storms. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $299.9 million in 2015 as compared to $270.8 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million, or 10.7 percent, primarily due to additional assets being placed in service, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of deferred pension credits and post-retirement medical regulatory liabilities which were fully amortized in July 2014 and amortization of deferred storm costs.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.2 million in 2014, an increase of $4.1 million or 97.6 percent, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOther Income. Other income was $13.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.8 million in 2014, an increase of $8.5 million, primarily due to increased guaranteed flat bill margins and an increase in the tax gross up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $104.8 million in 2015 as compared to $111.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in Federal tax credits.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E's net income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gross margin, which was almost offset by higher other operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,453.1 million in 2014 as compared to $2,262.2 million in 2013, an increase of $190.9 million, or 8.4 percent. Cost of sales were $1,106.6 million in 2014 as compared to $965.9 million in 2013, an increase of $140.7 million, or 14.6 percent. Gross margin was $1,346.5 million in 2014 as compared to $1,296.3 million in 2013, an increase of $50.2 million, or 3.9 percent.

Fuel expense was $627.5 million in 2014 as compared to $672.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $45.2 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas used offset by higher natural gas prices. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2013, OG&E's fuel mix was 53.0 percent coal, 40.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $444.1 million in 2014 as compared to $267.6 million in 2013, an increase of $176.5 million, or 66.0 percent, primarily due to an increase in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $35.0 million in 2014 as compared to $25.6 million in 2013, an increase of $9.4 million, or 36.7 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $453.2 million in 2014 as compared to $438.8 million in 2013, an increase of $14.4 million, or 3.3 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense: Table 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reduction in capitalized labor (A)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate overhead and allocations (B)\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract professional services (primarily marketing services)\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ongoing maintenance at power plants\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other marketing, sales and commercial (C)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software expense (D)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees, permits and licenses (E)\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vegetation management (F)\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits (G)\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and wages (H)\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other operation and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Portion of labor costs capitalized into projects decreased as a result of less work performed on storm restoration. \n (B) Increased primarily due to higher allocated costs from the holding company resulting from the formation of Enable during 2013. \n (C) Increased primarily due to demand side management customer payments which are recovered through a rider partially offset by a reduction in media services expense. \n (D) Increased as a result of higher expenditures related to Smart Grid software. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher SPP administration and assessment fees. \n (F) Decreased primarily due to increased spending on system hardening in 2013 which includes costs that are being recovered through a rider. \n (G) Decreased primarily due to lower pension expense, postretirement and other benefits. \n (H) Decreased primarily due to incentive compensation and lower overtime wages partially offset by higher regular salaries and wages. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $270.8 million in 2014 as compared to $248.4 million in 2013, an increase of $22.4 million, or nine percent, primarily due to additional transmission assets being placed in service throughout 2013 and 2014, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of the deferred pension credits regulatory liability which was fully amortized in July 2014. These were offset by the pension regulatory asset which was fully amortized in July 2013.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to $6.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 36.4 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from transmission projects being placed in service in 2014.\nOther Income. Other income was $4.8 million in 2014 as compared to $8.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.3 million or 40.7 percent, primarily due to decreased margins recognized in the guaranteed flat bill program during 2014 as a result of cooler weather in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2013 along with a decrease in the tax gross up related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOther Expense. Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations)\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>489.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (A)\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to OGE Holdings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) In September 2015, the Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis difference. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \nEffective May 1, 2013, the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired a 28.5 percent equity interest in Enable (26.3 percent as of December 31, 2015) which is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Prior to May 1, 2013, the Company reported the results of Enogex Holdings in the natural gas midstream operations segment.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes OGE Energy's share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of OGE Energy's original investment in Enogex LLC and its underlying equity in net assets of Enable. The basis difference is the result of the initial contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable in May 2013, and subsequent issuances of equity by Enable, including the initial public offering in April 2014 and the issuance of common units for the acquisition of CenterPoint's 24.95 percent interest in SESH. The basis difference is being amortized over approximately 30 years, the average life of the assets to which the basis difference is attributed. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is also adjusted for the elimination of the Enogex Holdings fair value adjustments.\nThe difference between OGE Energy's investment in Enable and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable was $783.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nReconciliation of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table reconciles OGE Energy's equity in earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE's share of Enable Net Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of basis difference\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of Enogex Holdings fair value and other adjustments\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table represents summarized financial information of Enable for 2014 and 2015:\nEnable Results of Operations\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids\n</td> <td>1,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe table set forth below illustrates the impact of the operating results of Enable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operation and maintenance\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (A)\n</td> <td>15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income/(expense)\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to OGE Holdings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) The Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge during the third quarter of 2015 for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis differences. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes decreased $163.0 million, or 95.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings of Enable of $157.1 million. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's gathering and processing business segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily from a decrease in gross margin, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in taxes other than income taxes. Gathering and processing gross margin decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices partially offset by increased volumes in the Anadarko and Williston basins. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's transportation and storage segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily due to lower margin on unrealized natural gas derivatives, a decrease in sales of NGLs due to lower prices, lower firm transportation revenues, a decrease in storage demand fees as well as lower rates on transportation services for local distribution companies and increased depreciation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins related to realized gains on system optimization activities and increased margins from higher rates on off-system transportation services.\nOver the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Should lower commodity prices persist, or should commodity prices decline further, Enable's future operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax benefit was $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to an expense of $69.1 million in 2014, a decrease in expense of $70.1 million primarily due to lower pre-tax operating income, a benefit recognized associated with a remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Company's investment in Enable and the impact of the goodwill impairment on Enable.\nOperating Data\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathered volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transportation volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>4.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas processed volumes - TBtu/d\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGLs sold - million gallons/d (A)(B)\n</td> <td>75.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Excludes condensate. \n (B) NGLS sold includes volumes of NGLS withdrawn from inventory or purchased for system balancing purposes. \nYear Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDue to deconsolidation of Enogex LLC on May 1, 2013, the Company recorded no operating income for this segment for the eight-month period from May 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 or the year ended December 31, 2014.

OGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $38.0 million, or 28.5 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period of 2013. The increase reflects the accretive effect to OGE Holdings of Enable, for the entire year of 2014, as compared to only eight months of 2013, following the formation of Enable on May 1, 2013. Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013, due to increased gathering and processing margins as a result of higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex basins (which offset lower gathering volumes) and higher crude oil gathering margins. Additionally, Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 due to higher transportation and storage margins as a result of an increase of unrealized gains on natural gas derivatives and an increase of system optimization activities. The higher margins were offset in part, by higher depreciation expenses resulting from assets being placed in service and higher operating and maintenance expenses. Finally, as a result of Enable's initial public offering in April 2014, and CenterPoint's exercising of its put right to Enable, for its 24.95 percent interest in SESH, OGE Energy's ownership in Enable dropped from 28.5 percent at the beginning of 2014 to 26.3 percent by the end of 2014, further partially offsetting the increase in earnings before taxes.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $69.1 million in 2014 as compared to $26.9 million in 2013, an increase of $42.2 million primarily due to higher pre-tax income and higher tax expense as compared to the prior period due to the absence of favorable deferred tax adjustments related to the formation of Enable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents was $75.2 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $69.7 million, primarily due to normal business operations and the quarterly distributions received from Enable.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $228.3 million and $249.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $21.6 million, or 8.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nIncome Taxes Receivable. The balance of Income Taxes Receivable was $17.2 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million,or 7.5 percent, primarily due to a receivable related to Oklahoma wind credits and overpayments refundable from Louisiana.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Tax. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $191.4 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel\nand purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nOther Current Assets. The balance of Other Current Assets was $55.6 million and $38.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $17.2 million, or 44.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in recoverable demand portfolio program costs.\nShort-Term Debt. Short-Term Debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98 million at December 31, 2014, due to a payoff of all short-term debt.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $262.5 million and $179.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $83.4 million, or 46.6 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $54.4 million and $38.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $16.2 million, or 42.4 percent, primarily resulting from the reclassification of retirement restoration payable in the second quarter of 2016 to accrued compensation as well as lower levels of accrued incentive compensation for 2014.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014 due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>865.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>721.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(500.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(559.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(957.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>59.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>397.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash (Used in) Provided from Financing Activities\n</td> <td>(295.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(163.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>338.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(80.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>(502.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $143.8 million, or 19.9 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries at OG&E and less cash paid to vendors, partially offset by Enable distributions classified as a return of capital in investing activities.\nThe increase of $98.4 million, or 15.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period; \n \u2022 an increase in cash distributions received from Enable in excess of cash distributions and cash provided from the operating activities of Enogex Holdings in 2013; and \n \u2022 an increase in cash received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from transmission revenue. \nThese increases were partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to vendors.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $59.0 million, or 10.6 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in investments related to return of capital from Enable and a decrease in capital expenditures related to transmission projects completed in 2014 partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to environmental projects at OG&E.\nThe decrease of $397.9 million, or 41.6 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures due to a decrease in transmission projects at OG&E and the deconsolidation of Enogex Holdings.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $131.8 million, or 80.5 percent in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2014 and an increase in dividends paid in 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the payment of $240.0 million in long-term debt during the third quarter during 2014.\nThe increase of $502.6 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in short-term debt; \n \u2022 the payment to retire $240.0 million of long-term debt in 2014; \n \u2022 payments in 2013 on advances from unconsolidated affiliates due to the deconsolidation of Enogex Holdings; and \n \u2022 contributions in 2013 from the ArcLight group related to the closing of the transaction to form Enable. \nThese increases were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in 2014.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Financing Activities\nThe Company's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities at OG&E. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate the Company's businesses) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Base Transmission\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Base Distribution\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Base Generation\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Other\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Base Transmission, Distribution, Generation and Other\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Known and Committed Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Regionally Allocated Projects (A)\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Large SPP Integrated Transmission Projects (B) (C)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Transmission Projects\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Projects:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - low NOX burners (D)\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - natural gas conversion (D)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental - dry scrubbers (D)\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combustion turbines - Mustang\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Other Projects\n</td> <td>350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Known and Committed Projects\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Typically 100kV to 299kV projects.

On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek \nrecovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving the Company's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015.

OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 12\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pension Plan\n</td> <td>Restoration of Retirement\nIncome Plan\n</td> <td>Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>680.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of plan assets\n</td> <td>581.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded status at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(170.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(221.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, the Company experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, the Company recorded pension settlement charges of $16.2 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by the Company and did not increase the Company's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. The Company's financial objective includes dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. At the Company's September 2015 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.27500 per share from $0.25000 per share effective in October 2015.\nSecurity Ratings\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Services\n</td> <td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Services\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OG&E Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A1\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>A+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Senior Notes\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OGE Energy Commercial Paper\n</td> <td>P2\n</td> <td>A2\n</td> <td>F2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $548.0 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $85.6 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $633.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $809.5 million and net contractual obligations of $88.2 million totaling $897.7 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, the Company's sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt, proceeds from other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling in the aggregate $1,150.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. Short-term debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98.0 million at December 31, 2014. The average balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $75.2 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.46 percent. The maximum month-end balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $180.0 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,148.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreements. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31,\n2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $75.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements to total in the aggregate $1,150.0 million ($750.0 million for the Company and $400.0 million for OG&E). Each of the credit facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company and OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of their credit agreements from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company and OG&E utilized their second extension to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, commitments of approximately $16.3 million and $8.7 million of the Company's and OG&E's credit facilities, respectively, however, were not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, such commitments will expire December 13, 2017.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2016 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nDistributions by Enable\nPursuant to the Enable limited partnership agreement, the amount of distributions the Company received from Enable were $139.3 million and $143.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised for all Company segments includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Company's Audit Committee. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>Impact on Funded Status\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual plan asset returns\n</td> <td>+/- 1 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $5.8 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>+/- 0.25 percent\n</td> <td>+/- $14.1 million\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions\n</td> <td>+/- $10 million\n</td> <td>+/- $10.0 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18, 2010, Oklahoma submitted its SIP to the EPA, which set forth the state's plan for compliance with the Federal regional haze rule. The SIP was subject to the EPA's review and approval.\nThe Oklahoma SIP included requirements for reducing emissions of NOX and SO2 from OG&E's seven BART-eligible units at the Seminole, Muskogee and Sooner generating stations. The SIP also included a waiver from BART requirements for all eligible units at the Horseshoe Lake generating station based on air modeling that showed no significant impact on visibility in nearby national parks and wilderness areas. The SIP concluded that BART for reducing NOX emissions at all of the subject units should be the installation of low NOX burners with overfired air (flue gas recirculation was also required on two of the units) and set forth associated NOX emission rates and limits.\nOn December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule in which it rejected the SO2 portion of the Oklahoma SIP and issued a FIP in its place. OG&E and the State of Oklahoma's subsequent appeal of the FIP with the Tenth Circuit of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court ended on May 27, 2014 when the Supreme Court denied OG&E's Petition for Certiorari, upholding the EPA's FIP for SO2. The FIP compliance date is now January 4, 2019.\nOn December 9, 2015, the EPA released a final rule partially disapproving the revisions to the 2010 Oklahoma SIP for Regional Haze and promulgated FIPs in their place for Oklahoma and Texas. The EPA disapproved portions of the Oklahoma SIP related to the establishment of Reasonable Progress Goals for the Class I area located within the state and promulgated revised Reasonable Progress Goals based on the FIP implementation in Texas. As a result, no further requirements are required in Oklahoma to meet the 2018 Reasonable Progress Goals for Oklahoma.\nOn August 6, 2014, OG&E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application seeks approval of the environmental compliance plan and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asked the OCC to predetermine the prudence of replacing OG&E's soon-to-be retired Mustang steam turbines in late 2017 with 400 MWs of new, efficient combustion turbines at the Mustang site in 2018 and 2019 and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. OG&E estimates the total capital cost associated with its environmental compliance plan included in this application to be approximately $1.1 billion. The OCC hearing on OG&E's application before an ALJ began on March 3, 2015 and concluded on April 8, 2015. Multiple parties advocating a variety of positions intervened in the proceeding.\nOn June 8, 2015, the ALJ issued his report on OG&E's application. While the ALJ in his report agreed that the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas pursuant to OG&E's ECP is the best approach, the ALJ's report included several recommendations. OG&E filed exceptions to the ALJ's report and on July 21, 2015, Commissioner Bob Anthony issued his deliberation statement that was consistent with many parts of the ALJ's report, including the ALJ's support of OG&E's ECP, the ALJ's recommendation to pre-approve certain estimated costs of the environmental recovery plan, and the ALJ's recommendation to defer all other cost recovery issues until the next general rate case.\nOn December 2, 2015, OG&E received an order from the OCC denying, by a two to one vote, its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider.\nOn December 11, 2015, OG&E filed a motion requesting modification of the OCC order for the purposes of approving only the ECP. OG&E did not seek modification to any other provisions of the OCC order, including cost recovery. OG&E also agreed that it would not implement a rider for recovery of the costs of the ECP until and unless authorized by the OCC in a subsequent proceeding.\nOn December 23, 2015, the OCC rejected, by a two to one vote, a proposal by Commissioner Dana Murphy to grant OG&E's December 11, 2015 motion.\nOn February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the United States to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. In December 2011, the EPA published a supplemental CSAPR, which would make six additional states, including Oklahoma, subject to the CSAPR for NOX emissions during the ozone-season from May 1 through September 30. Under the rule, OG&E would have been required to reduce ozone-season NOX emissions from its electrical generating units within the state beginning in 2012. In response to legal challenges of the final rule on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule, which includes the supplemental rule, pending a decision on the merits. By order dated August 21, 2012, the Court of Appeals vacated the CSAPR and ordered the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals. On October 23, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the EPA's request that the court lift the stay of the CSAPR. The EPA subsequently clarified that compliance with the CSAPR would begin in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E has installed five low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and one Seminole unit and is in compliance with the final rule. In the meantime, the petitions\nfor review of the supplemental rule remain pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of issues that are not addressed by the Supreme Court's decision.\nOn December 3, 2015, the EPA proposed an update to CSAPR finding that ozone-season NOX emissions in 23 eastern states including Oklahoma affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain ozone standards and proposing to issue FIPs to update the existing NOX ozone-season emission budgets for electrical generating units. The proposed rule reduces OG&E's NOX emissions requirements under the current CSAPR by 25 percent. Compliance is proposed to begin in May 2017. OG&E continues to evaluate what additional measures, if any, will be needed for compliance with the new rule.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The final rule uses a numerical standard to establish limits for particulate matter (as a surrogate for toxic metals), hydrogen chloride and mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. Compliance was required within three years of the rule's effective date. Based on OG&E's request for a one-year extension, the deadline for compliance was extended to April 16, 2016. To comply with this rule, OG&E utilized activated carbon injections at each of its five coal-fired units during 2015.\nThe final MATS rule was appealed by several parties, but OG&E was not a party to the appeals. After withstanding judicial scrutiny at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, the MATS rule was challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs imposed on utilities at the first stage of the EPA's regulatory analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the rule, but reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. The MATS rule currently remains in effect and OG&E is still required to meet the April 2016 compliance deadline.\nFederal Clean Air Act New Source Review Litigation\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, OG&E received a request for information from the EPA regarding Federal Clean Air Act compliance at OG&E's Muskogee and Sooner generating plants.\nOn July 8, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against OG&E in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E did not follow the Federal Clean Air Act procedures for projecting emission increases attributable to eight projects that occurred between 2003 and 2006. This complaint seeks to have OG&E submit a new assessment of whether the projects were likely to result in a significant emissions increase. The Sierra Club intervened in this proceeding. On August 30, 2013, the government filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and on September 6, 2013, OG&E filed a Motion to Dismiss the case. On January 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGuisti dismissed the complaints filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club. The Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims because plaintiffs failed to present an actual case or controversy\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court also ruled in the alternative that, even if plaintiffs had presented a case or controversy, it would have nonetheless decline[d] to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d The EPA and the Sierra Club did not file an appeal of the Court's ruling.\nOn August 12, 2013, the Sierra Club filed a separate complaint against OG&E in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E projects at Muskogee Unit 6 in 2008 were made without obtaining a prevention of significant deterioration permit and that the plant had exceeded emissions limits for opacity and particulate matter. The Sierra Club seeks a permanent injunction preventing OG&E from operating the Muskogee generating plant. On March 4, 2014, the Eastern District dismissed the prevention of significant deterioration permit claim based on the statute of limitations, but allowed the opacity and particulate matter claims to proceed. To obtain the right to appeal this decision, the Sierra Club subsequently withdrew a Notice of Intent to Sue for additional Clean Air Act violations and asked the Eastern District to dismiss its remaining claims with prejudice. On August 27, 2014, the Eastern District granted the Sierra Club's request. The Sierra Club has filed a Notice of Appeal with the 10th Circuit where oral argument was held on March 18, 2015.\nAt this time, OG&E continues to believe that it has acted in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act, and OG&E expects to vigorously defend against the claims that have been asserted. If OG&E does not prevail in the remainder of the proceedings, the EPA and the Sierra Club could seek to require OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment, including dry scrubbers, baghouses and selective catalytic reduction systems with capital costs in excess of $1.1 billion and pay fines and significant penalties as a result of the allegations in the notice of violation. Section 113 of the Federal Clean Air Act (along with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1996) provides for civil penalties as much as $37,500 per day for each violation. Due to the uncertain and preliminary nature of this litigation, OG&E cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss in this case.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of the end of 2015, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS. The Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nIn August of 2013, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a complaint under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Air Act based on the EPA's failure to promulgate and publish designations for the 2010 revised primary SO2 NAAQS. On March 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order granting the EPA and the Sierra Club's joint motion to approve and enter a consent decree that set forth mandatory deadlines for the EPA to issue designations for all areas of the country that remained undesignated. On September 18, 2015 the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality reported to the EPA that no areas in Oklahoma should be designated as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 standard. This non-attainment designation is subject to the EPA's approval. In a letter dated February 11, 2016, EPA Region 6 notified Oklahoma of their intent to designate part of Muskogee County in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. EPA is expected to finalize this designation in July, 2016 following public comment. This could require additional controls scrubbers on the affected units. On August 21, 2015, EPA finalized a data requirements rule for implementing the 2010 SO2 standard requiring air agencies to characterize air quality around sources that emit 2,000 tons per year or more of SO2 via air quality modeling or ambient air monitoring. In July 2016, air agencies will be required to identify either ambient monitoring or air quality modeling as a method for characterizing air quality for 2,000 tons per year or larger sources. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether this determination will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nOn September 30, 2015 the EPA finalized a new ambient standard for ozone at 70 ppb which is more stringent than the current standard of 75 ppb, set in 2008. States must submit non-attainment designations as appropriate based on existing ambient data before October 2016 for the EPA's approval. Compliance with the new standard begins in 2020 or later depending on the degree of the area's non-attainment designation. All areas in Oklahoma currently meet the new standard.\nThe Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nClean Power Plan\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs/MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr) goals. The 2030 rate-based reduction requirement for all existing generating units in Oklahoma has decreased from a proposed 43 percent reduction to 32 percent in the final rule. The mass-based approach for existing units calls for a 24 percent reduction by 2030 in Oklahoma. The Clean Power Plan requires that states submit to the EPA plans for achieving the state-specific CO2 reduction goals by September 6, 2016 or submit an extension request for up to two years. The compliance period was to begin in 2022, and emission reductions were to be phased in by 2030. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that an approvable state plan was not submitted to the EPA by the required deadline.\nA number of states have filed lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of challenges to the rule. The Company is unable to determine what impact the lawsuits will ultimately have on the Clean Power Plan or what impact the stay in implementation will have; however, if the Clean Power Plan survives judicial review and is implemented as written, it could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Significant uncertainties would remain with regards to potential implementation in Oklahoma (and the federal plan that would be imposed by the EPA for states that do not submit approvable plans), including whether states would elect an emissions standards approach versus a state measures approach, whether and what type of emissions trading would be allowed, and available cost mitigation options. Due to the pending litigation and the uncertainties in the state approaches, the ultimate timing and impact of these standards on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. In December 2015, as part of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States committed to reduce economy wide emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 emission levels. This multinational agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and \"represent a progression\" every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement could result in future additional emissions reductions in the United States, however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which commitments under the December 2015 Paris Agreement will be implemented through the Clean Air Act, other than existing statutes and new legislation.\nSeveral states have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nIn 2009, the EPA adopted a comprehensive national system for reporting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases produced by major sources in the United States. The reporting requirements apply to large direct emitters of greenhouse gases with emissions equal to or greater than a threshold of 25,000 metric tons per year, which includes certain OG&E facilities. OG&E also reports quarterly its CO2 emissions from generating units subject to the Federal Acid Rain Program. OG&E has submitted the reports required by the applicable reporting rules.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d, OG&E has filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP by converting two coal-fired generating units at Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E also seeks to utilize renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas. OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource area in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nEPA Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction Policy\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the outdated provisions in the SIP of 36 states, including Oklahoma, regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy to assure consistency with the Clean Air Act and other recent court decisions. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality is in the process of developing a SIP to comply with this rule, which is to be submitted to the EPA before November 2016. Although the extent of impact is not known, this rule will impact certain OG&E units.\nEndangered Species\nCertain Federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which the Company conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, the Company's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or the Company could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nIn 2014, the Company enrolled in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies range-wide conservation plan which consists of industry-specific conservation practices that apply to projects and activities in the impacted area. The range-wide\nconservation plan was approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and incorporated as part of the agency's final decision on March 27, 2014 to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. On September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court Western District of Texas vacated federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's failure to thoroughly consider the active conservation efforts in making the listing decision.\nAir Quality Control System\nOn September 10, 2014, OG&E executed a contract for the design, engineering and fabrication of two circulating dry scrubber systems to be installed at Sooner Units 1 and 2. OG&E entered into an agreement on February 9, 2015, to install the dry scrubber systems. The dry scrubbers are part of OG&E's ECP and scheduled to be completed by 2019. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under the Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d section of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWaste\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nOn December 19, 2014, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The final rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. OG&E has evaluated the potential impacts of the final rule on our ash ponds and has set up a reserve based on a reasonable estimate.\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2015, the Company obtained refunds of $2.3 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nWater\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and Federal waters.\nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014. OG&E submitted compliance plans to the state in April 2015. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation.\nSite Remediation\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generate wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and regulations, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nThe Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and has the ability to exercise significant influence.\nThe electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business.\nThe natural gas midstream operations segment currently represents the Company's investment in Enable through its wholly owned subsidiary OGE Holdings. Enable is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Bakken shale formation, principally located in the Williston basin of North Dakota. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois. For periods prior to the formation of Enable, the natural gas midstream operations segment reflected the consolidated results of Enogex Holdings.\nEnable was formed effective May 1, 2013 by the Company, the ArcLight group and CenterPoint to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. In the formation transaction, the Company and the ArcLight group contributed Enogex LLC to Enable and the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired an equity interest in Enable. The Company's contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable met the requirements of being in substance real estate and was recorded at historical cost. The general partner of Enable is equally controlled by CenterPoint and OGE Energy, who each have 50 percent management ownership. Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control, effective May 1, 2013, the Company began accounting for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting.\nIn April 2014, Enable completed an initial public offering of 25,000,000 common units resulting in Enable becoming a publicly traded Master Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 111.0 million limited partner units, or 26.3 percent, of which 68.2 million limited partner units were subordinated.\nOn January 22, 2016, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of $0.3180 per unit on its outstanding common and subordinated units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. Based on current commodity prices, Enable has seen changes in producer activity that have negatively impacted Enable's operations and financial position and could see additional changes in producer activity that may negatively impact Enable's operations and affect its future distribution rates. If cash distributions to Enable's unitholders exceed $0.330625 per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to 50 percent, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. OGE Holdings is entitled to 60 percent of those incentive distributions.\u201d\nOG&E began participating in the SPP Integrated Marketplace effective March 1, 2014. The SPP Integrated Marketplace replaced the SPP Energy Imbalance Services market. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP assumed balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations, and determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.\nOverview\nCompany Strategy\nThe Company's mission, through OG&E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.\nOG&E is focused on:\n \u2022 Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity. \n \u2022 Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve. A particular focus is on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments. \n \u2022 Maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members. \n \u2022 Continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results. \n \u2022 Complying with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze requirements. \n \u2022 Ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers. \n \u2022 Continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. \nAdditionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of three to five percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. The Company also relies on cash distributions from its investment in Enable to fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships.\nSummary of Operating Results\n2015 compared to 2014. Net income attributable to OGE Energy was $271.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to $395.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2014. The decrease in net income attributable to OGE Energy of $124.5 million, or 31.5 percent, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OGE Holdings of $92.9 million, or 90.8 percent, or $0.46 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to the goodwill impairment adjustment at Enable in September 2015 and lower revenues driven by lower average natural gas and NGLs prices; \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OGE Energy of $8.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to charges associated with pre-construction expenditures for new office space to consolidate Oklahoma City personnel; and \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OG&E of $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, or $0.11 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2015, and a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in customer growth, an increase in other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction. \n2014 compared to 2013. Net income attributable to OGE Energy was $395.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2014 as compared to $387.6 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, in 2013. The increase in net income attributable to OGE Energy of $8.2 million, or 2.1 percent, or $0.04 per diluted share, in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 an increase in net income at OGE Holdings of $2.4 million, or 2.4 percent, or $0.01 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, due partially to the accretive effect to OGE Holdings of Enable partially offset by a reduction in deferred state income taxes in 2013 associated with a remeasurement of the accumulated deferred taxes related to the formation of Enable; \n \u2022 an increase in net income at OGE Energy of $6.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, primarily due to decreased transaction expenses related to the formation of Enable and a decrease in losses for the deferred compensation plan; and \n \u2022 a decrease in net income at OG&E of $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, or $0.01 per diluted share of the Company's common stock, reflecting an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets being placed in service in 2014, a decrease in gross margin related to milder weather compared to 2013, an increase in other operation and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in wholesale transmission revenues, an increase in customer growth and a decrease in incentive compensation. \nA more detailed discussion regarding the financial performance of OG&E and the Natural Gas Midstream Operations can be found under \"Results of Operations\" below.\n2016 Outlook\nKey assumptions for 2016 include:\nOG&E\nThe Company projects OG&E to earn approximately $288 million to $300 million or $1.44 to $1.50 per average diluted share in 2016 and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 normal weather patterns are experienced for the remainder of the year; \n \u2022 new rates take effect in Oklahoma in mid 2016; \n \u2022 gross margin on revenues of approximately $1.405 billion to $1.415 billion based on sales growth of approximately one percent on a weather-adjusted basis; \n \u2022 approximately $106 million of gross margin is primarily attributed to regionally allocated transmission projects; \n \u2022 operating expenses of approximately $885 million to $895 million, with operation and maintenance expenses comprising 54 percent of the total; \n \u2022 interest expense of approximately $140 million which assumes a $8 million allowance for borrowed funds used during construction reduction to interest expense; \n \u2022 other income of approximately $27 million including approximately $15 million of allowance for equity funds used during construction; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent. \nOG&E has significant seasonality in its earnings. OG&E typically shows minimal earnings in the first and fourth quarters with a majority of earnings in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of air conditioning demand.\nOGE Enogex Holdings LLC\nThe Company projects the earnings contribution from its ownership interest in Enable Midstream to be approximately $56 million to $66 million or $0.28 to $0.33 per average diluted share.\nConsolidated OGE\nThe Company's 2016 earnings guidance is between approximately $344 million and $366 million of net income, or $1.72 to $1.83 per average diluted share and is based on the following assumptions:\n \u2022 approximately 200 million average diluted shares outstanding; and \n \u2022 an effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOngoing Earnings and Ongoing Earnings per Average Diluted Share are defined by the Company as GAAP Earnings and GAAP Earnings per Average Diluted Share adjusted to exclude non-cash charges. These financial measures excluded non-cash charges of approximately $108.4 million or $0.33 per average diluted share associated with the Company's share of Enable's goodwill impairment as well as a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $5.8 million or $0.02 per average diluted share. The Company's management believes that ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results and are more representative of the Company's fundamental core earnings power. The Company's management uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Reconciliations of ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per average diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are below.\n\n\n (A) On September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $108.4 million or $0.33 per average diluted share for its portion of Enable's goodwill impairment. Additionally, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax charge of $5.8 million or $0.02 per average diluted share for a pension settlement charge related to Enable. \n (B) There were no similar charges for the year ended December 31, 2014, therefore ongoing earnings and GAAP earnings are the same. \nGross margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses. Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income. OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.\n\n (A) Based on the midpoint of OG&E earnings guidance for 2016. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that affected the Company's consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the Company's consolidated financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Known trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent considered relevant.\n\nResults by Business Segment\n\n (A) Subsequent to the completion of the October 1, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test and previous interim assessment as of December 31, 2014, the crude oil and natural gas industry was impacted by further commodity price declines, which consequently resulted in decreased producer activity in certain regions in which Enable operates. As a result, when Enable performed the first step of its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2015, it determined that the carrying value of the gathering and processing and transportation and storage segments exceeded fair value. Enable completed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis comparing the implied fair value for those reporting units to the carrying amount of that goodwill and determined that goodwill for those units was completely impaired in the amount of $1,086.4 million as of September 30, 2015. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge during the third quarter of 2015 for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis differences. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \n (B) Other Operations primarily includes the operations of the holding company and consolidating eliminations. \nThe following operating results analysis by business segment includes intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOG&E (Electric Utility)\n\n (A) Degree days are calculated as follows: The high and low degrees of a particular day are added together and then averaged. If the calculated average is above 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as cooling degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one cooling degree day. If the calculated average is below 65 degrees, then the difference between the calculated average and 65 is expressed as heating degree days, with each degree of difference equaling one heating degree day. The daily calculations are then totaled for the particular reporting period. \n2015 compared to 2014. OG&E's net income decreased $23.1 million, or 7.9 percent, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher depreciation expense and lower gross margin partially offset by higher other income and an increase in allowance for equity funds used in construction.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,196.9 million in 2015 as compared to $2,453.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $256.2 million, or 10.4 percent. Cost of sales were $865.0 million in 2015 as compared to $1,106.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $241.6 million, or 21.8 percent. Gross margin was $1,331.9 million in 2015 as compared to $1,346.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 1.1 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin:\n\n (A) The overall cooling degree days decreased two percent in 2015 compared to 2014 with August decreasing by 14 percent. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to a true up for the base plan projects in the SPP formula rate for 2014 and 2015 as well as a reduction in the point-to-point credits shared with retail customers. \n (C) On June 30, 2015, the wholesale power contract with AVEC expired. \n (D) Increased primarily due to sales and customer mix. \nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission related charges. Fuel expense was $458.5 million in 2015 as compared to $627.5 million in 2014, a decrease of $169.0 million, or 26.9 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas prices offset by higher natural gas used. In 2015, OG&E's fuel mix was 49.0 percent coal, 44.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61.0 percent coal, 32.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $362.6 million in 2015 as compared to $444.1 million in 2014, a decrease of $81.5 million, or 18.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $43.9 million in 2015 as compared to $35.0 million in 2014, an increase of $8.9 million, or 25.4 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. The OCC, the APSC and the FERC have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees OG&E pays to its affiliate, Enable.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $444.5 million in 2015 as compared to $453.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $8.7 million, or 1.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense:\n\n (A) Decreased primarily due to more capital projects and storm costs exceeding the $2.7 million threshold, which were moved to a regulatory asset. \n (B) Decreased primarily due to less work at the power plants. \n (C) Decreased primarily due to decreased engineering services. \n (D) Increased primarily due to higher medical costs incurred partially offset by lower pension costs. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher demand side management customer payments. \n (F) Increased primarily due to annual salary increases and increased overtime related to storms. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $299.9 million in 2015 as compared to $270.8 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million, or 10.7 percent, primarily due to additional assets being placed in service, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of deferred pension credits and post-retirement medical regulatory liabilities which were fully amortized in July 2014 and amortization of deferred storm costs.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.2 million in 2014, an increase of $4.1 million or 97.6 percent, primarily due to higher construction work in progress balances resulting from increased spending for environmental projects.\nOther Income. Other income was $13.3 million in 2015 as compared to $4.8 million in 2014, an increase of $8.5 million, primarily due to increased guaranteed flat bill margins and an increase in the tax gross up related to higher allowance for funds used during construction.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $104.8 million in 2015 as compared to $111.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 6.1 percent, primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in Federal tax credits.\n2014 compared to 2013. OG&E's net income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher gross margin, which was almost offset by higher other operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense.\nGross Margin\nOperating revenues were $2,453.1 million in 2014 as compared to $2,262.2 million in 2013, an increase of $190.9 million, or 8.4 percent. Cost of sales were $1,106.6 million in 2014 as compared to $965.9 million in 2013, an increase of $140.7 million, or 14.6 percent. Gross margin was $1,346.5 million in 2014 as compared to $1,296.3 million in 2013, an increase of $50.2 million, or 3.9 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in gross margin:\n\n (A) Increased primarily due to higher investments related to certain FERC approved transmission projects included in formula rates. \n (B) Increased due to higher rider revenues primarily from the Oklahoma Demand Program rider, the Oklahoma Storm Recovery rider and the Arkansas Demand Program rider partially offset by lower rider revenues from the Oklahoma Crossroads rider, Oklahoma Smart Grid rider, Oklahoma System Hardening rider and the Arkansas Crossroads rider. \nCost of sales for OG&E consists of fuel used in electric generation, purchased power and transmission related charges. Fuel expense was $627.5 million in 2014 as compared to $672.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $45.2 million, or 6.7 percent, primarily due to lower natural gas used offset by higher natural gas prices. In 2014, OG&E's fuel mix was 61 percent coal, 32 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. In 2013, OG&E's fuel mix was 53.0 percent coal, 40.0 percent natural gas and seven percent wind. Purchased power costs were $444.1 million in 2014 as compared to $267.6 million in 2013, an increase of $176.5 million, or 66.0 percent, primarily due to an increase in purchases from the SPP, reflecting the impact of OG&E's participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which began on March 1, 2014. Transmission related charges were $35.0 million in 2014 as compared to $25.6 million in 2013, an increase of $9.4 million, or 36.7 percent, primarily due to higher SPP charges for the base plan projects of other utilities.\nOperating Expenses\nOther operation and maintenance expenses were $453.2 million in 2014 as compared to $438.8 million in 2013, an increase of $14.4 million, or 3.3 percent. The below factors contributed to the change in other operations and maintenance expense: \n (A) Portion of labor costs capitalized into projects decreased as a result of less work performed on storm restoration. \n (B) Increased primarily due to higher allocated costs from the holding company resulting from the formation of Enable during 2013. \n (C) Increased primarily due to demand side management customer payments which are recovered through a rider partially offset by a reduction in media services expense. \n (D) Increased as a result of higher expenditures related to Smart Grid software. \n (E) Increased primarily due to higher SPP administration and assessment fees. \n (F) Decreased primarily due to increased spending on system hardening in 2013 which includes costs that are being recovered through a rider. \n (G) Decreased primarily due to lower pension expense, postretirement and other benefits. \n (H) Decreased primarily due to incentive compensation and lower overtime wages partially offset by higher regular salaries and wages. \nDepreciation and amortization expense was $270.8 million in 2014 as compared to $248.4 million in 2013, an increase of $22.4 million, or nine percent, primarily due to additional transmission assets being placed in service throughout 2013 and 2014, along with an increase resulting from the amortization of the deferred pension credits regulatory liability which was fully amortized in July 2014. These were offset by the pension regulatory asset which was fully amortized in July 2013.\nAdditional Information\nAllowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction. Allowance for equity funds used during construction was $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to $6.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 36.4 percent, primarily due to lower construction work in progress balances resulting from transmission projects being placed in service in 2014.\nOther Income. Other income was $4.8 million in 2014 as compared to $8.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $3.3 million or 40.7 percent, primarily due to decreased margins recognized in the guaranteed flat bill program during 2014 as a result of cooler weather in the first quarter as compared to the same period in 2013 along with a decrease in the tax gross up related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.\nOther Expense. Other expense was $1.9 million in 2014 as compared to $4.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.7 million or 58.7 percent, primarily due to decreased charitable donations during 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $141.5 million in 2014 as compared to $129.3 million in 2013, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.4 percent, primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in interest on long-term debt related to a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in May 2013, a $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in March 2014 and an additional $250.0 million debt issuance that occurred in December 2014 partially offset by the early redemption of $140.0 million senior notes in August 2014. In addition, there was a $2.0 million increase reflecting a reduction in 2013 interest expense related to tax matters offset by a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction of $1.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $111.6 million in 2014 as compared to $113.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 1.7 percent. The reduction reflects lower pretax income partially offset by a reduction in state tax credits recognized during the year and an increase in Federal credits recognized.\nOGE Holdings (Natural Gas Midstream Operations)\n\n (A) In September 2015, the Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis difference. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \nEffective May 1, 2013, the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired a 28.5 percent equity interest in Enable (26.3 percent as of December 31, 2015) which is being accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Prior to May 1, 2013, the Company reported the results of Enogex Holdings in the natural gas midstream operations segment.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes OGE Energy's share of Enable earnings adjusted for the amortization of the basis difference of OGE Energy's original investment in Enogex LLC and its underlying equity in net assets of Enable. The basis difference is the result of the initial contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable in May 2013, and subsequent issuances of equity by Enable, including the initial public offering in April 2014 and the issuance of common units for the acquisition of CenterPoint's 24.95 percent interest in SESH. The basis difference is being amortized over approximately 30 years, the average life of the assets to which the basis difference is attributed. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is also adjusted for the elimination of the Enogex Holdings fair value adjustments.\nThe difference between OGE Energy's investment in Enable and its underlying equity in the net assets of Enable was $783.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nReconciliation of Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table reconciles OGE Energy's equity in earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe following table represents summarized financial information of Enable for 2014 and 2015:\nEnable Results of Operations\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe table set forth below illustrates the impact of the operating results of Enable for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n (A) The Company recorded a $108.4 million pre-tax charge during the third quarter of 2015 for its share of the goodwill impairment, as adjusted for the basis differences. See Note 3 for further discussion of Enable's goodwill impairment. \nOGE Holdings' earnings before taxes decreased $163.0 million, or 95.1 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings of Enable of $157.1 million. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's gathering and processing business segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily from a decrease in gross margin, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in taxes other than income taxes. Gathering and processing gross margin decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices partially offset by increased volumes in the Anadarko and Williston basins. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Enable's transportation and storage segment reported a decrease in operating income primarily due to lower margin on unrealized natural gas derivatives, a decrease in sales of NGLs due to lower prices, lower firm transportation revenues, a decrease in storage demand fees as well as lower rates on transportation services for local distribution companies and increased depreciation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by higher margins related to realized gains on system optimization activities and increased margins from higher rates on off-system transportation services.\nOver the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Should lower commodity prices persist, or should commodity prices decline further, Enable's future operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax benefit was $1.0 million in 2015 as compared to an expense of $69.1 million in 2014, a decrease in expense of $70.1 million primarily due to lower pre-tax operating income, a benefit recognized associated with a remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Company's investment in Enable and the impact of the goodwill impairment on Enable.\nOperating Data\n\n (A) Excludes condensate. \n (B) NGLS sold includes volumes of NGLS withdrawn from inventory or purchased for system balancing purposes. \nYear Ended December 31, 2014 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDue to deconsolidation of Enogex LLC on May 1, 2013, the Company recorded no operating income for this segment for the eight-month period from May 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 or the year ended December 31, 2014. Earnings after May 1, 2013 reflect the Company's equity interest in Enable's results, which are recorded in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate, and the related tax effect. The table set forth below illustrates the impact of the operating results of Enable for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the combined results of Enogex LLC for the four months ended April 30, 2013 and Enable for the eight months from May 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.\n\nOGE Holdings' net income decreased $4.2 million, or four percent for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period of 2013 due to higher pre-tax income and higher tax expense. OGE Holdings' earnings before taxes increased $38.0 million, or 28.5 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period of 2013. The increase reflects the accretive effect to OGE Holdings of Enable, for the entire year of 2014, as compared to only eight months of 2013, following the formation of Enable on May 1, 2013. Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013, due to increased gathering and processing margins as a result of higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex basins (which offset lower gathering volumes) and higher crude oil gathering margins. Additionally, Enable's operating results for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 due to higher transportation and storage margins as a result of an increase of unrealized gains on natural gas derivatives and an increase of system optimization activities. The higher margins were offset in part, by higher depreciation expenses resulting from assets being placed in service and higher operating and maintenance expenses. Finally, as a result of Enable's initial public offering in April 2014, and CenterPoint's exercising of its put right to Enable, for its 24.95 percent interest in SESH, OGE Energy's ownership in Enable dropped from 28.5 percent at the beginning of 2014 to 26.3 percent by the end of 2014, further partially offsetting the increase in earnings before taxes.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $69.1 million in 2014 as compared to $26.9 million in 2013, an increase of $42.2 million primarily due to higher pre-tax income and higher tax expense as compared to the prior period due to the absence of favorable deferred tax adjustments related to the formation of Enable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangement\nOG&E Railcar Lease Agreement\nOG&E has several noncancellable operating leases with purchase options, covering approximately 1,400 rotary gondola railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to OG&E's coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to fuel expense and are recovered through OG&E's tariffs and fuel adjustment clauses.\nOn January 11, 2012, OG&E executed a five-year lease agreement for 135 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn October 14, 2014, OG&E signed a separate three-year lease effective December 2014 for 131 railcars to replace railcars that have been taken out of service or destroyed.\nOn December 17, 2015, OG&E renewed the lease agreement effective February 1, 2016. At the end of the new lease term, which is February 1, 2019, OG&E has the option to either purchase the railcars at a stipulated fair market value or renew the lease. If OG&E chooses not to purchase the railcars or renew the lease agreement and the actual fair value of the railcars is less than the stipulated fair market value, OG&E would be responsible for the difference in those values up to a maximum of $20.1 million. OG&E is also required to maintain all of the railcars it has under the operating lease and has entered into an agreement with a non-affiliated company to furnish this maintenance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is defined as the difference in current assets and current liabilities. The Company's working capital requirements are driven generally by changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, commodity prices, credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, customers, the level and timing of spending for maintenance and expansion activity, inventory levels and fuel recoveries.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents was $75.2 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $69.7 million, primarily due to normal business operations and the quarterly distributions received from Enable.\nAccounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues. The balance of Accounts Receivable and Accrued Unbilled Revenues was $228.3 million and $249.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $21.6 million, or 8.6 percent, primarily due to a decrease in billings to OG&E's retail customers.\nIncome Taxes Receivable. The balance of Income Taxes Receivable was $17.2 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million,or 7.5 percent, primarily due to a receivable related to Oklahoma wind credits and overpayments refundable from Louisiana.\nFuel Inventories. The balance of Fuel Inventories was $113.8 million and $58.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $55.3 million, or 94.5 percent, primarily due to higher coal inventory balances at OG&E's coal fired plants resulting from lower participation in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nDeferred Income Tax. Deferred Income Tax assets had no balance as of December 31, 2015 compared to $191.4 million at December 31, 2014, due to a reclassification of the balance to Non-Current Deferred Income Taxes pursuant to early adoption of ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740)\u201d.\nFuel Clause Recoveries. The Fuel Clause balance moved from an under recovery position of $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 to an over recovery balance of $61.3 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher amounts billed to OG&E retail customers as compared to the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. The fuel recovery clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers' bills. As a result, OG&E under recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel\nand purchased power cost recoveries exceed fuel adjustment clause recoveries and over recovers fuel costs when the actual fuel and purchased power costs are below the fuel adjustment clause recoveries. Provisions in the fuel clauses are intended to allow OG&E to amortize under and over recovery balances into future cost recoveries.\nOther Current Assets. The balance of Other Current Assets was $55.6 million and $38.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $17.2 million, or 44.8 percent, primarily due to an increase in recoverable demand portfolio program costs.\nShort-Term Debt. Short-Term Debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98 million at December 31, 2014, due to a payoff of all short-term debt.\nAccounts Payable. The balance of Accounts Payable was $262.5 million and $179.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $83.4 million, or 46.6 percent, primarily due to storm accruals and timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease of fuel and purchased power expense.\nAccrued Compensation. The balance of Accrued Compensation was $54.4 million and $38.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $16.2 million, or 42.4 percent, primarily resulting from the reclassification of retirement restoration payable in the second quarter of 2016 to accrued compensation as well as lower levels of accrued incentive compensation for 2014.\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year. The balance of Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year was $110.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to no balance at December 31, 2014 due to the reclassification of long-term debt that will mature in January 2016.\nCash Flows\n\n* Greater than a 100 percent variance.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase of $143.8 million, or 19.9 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from fuel recoveries at OG&E and less cash paid to vendors, partially offset by Enable distributions classified as a return of capital in investing activities.\nThe increase of $98.4 million, or 15.8 percent, in net cash provided from operating activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 the absence of fuel refunds to customers during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, partially offset by fuel under recoveries in the same period; \n \u2022 an increase in cash distributions received from Enable in excess of cash distributions and cash provided from the operating activities of Enogex Holdings in 2013; and \n \u2022 an increase in cash received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from transmission revenue. \nThese increases were partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to vendors.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease of $59.0 million, or 10.6 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in investments related to return of capital from Enable and a decrease in capital expenditures related to transmission projects completed in 2014 partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to environmental projects at OG&E.\nThe decrease of $397.9 million, or 41.6 percent, in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures due to a decrease in transmission projects at OG&E and the deconsolidation of Enogex Holdings.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase of $131.8 million, or 80.5 percent in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt during 2014 and an increase in dividends paid in 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the payment of $240.0 million in long-term debt during the third quarter during 2014.\nThe increase of $502.6 million in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to:\n \u2022 a decrease in short-term debt; \n \u2022 the payment to retire $240.0 million of long-term debt in 2014; \n \u2022 payments in 2013 on advances from unconsolidated affiliates due to the deconsolidation of Enogex Holdings; and \n \u2022 contributions in 2013 from the ArcLight group related to the closing of the transaction to form Enable. \nThese increases were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in 2014.\nFuture Capital Requirements and Financing Activities\nThe Company's primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities at OG&E. Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. The Company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) and permanent financings.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company's consolidated estimates of capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 are shown in the following table. These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate the Company's businesses) plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.\n\n (A) Typically 100kV to 299kV projects. Approximately 30 percent of revenue requirement allocated to SPP members other than OG&E. \n (B) Typically 300kV and above projects. Approximately 85 percent of revenue requirement allocated to SPP members other than OG&E. \n\n (D) Represent capital costs associated with OG&E's ECP to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze rules. More detailed discussion regarding Regional Haze and OG&E's ECP can be found in Note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements under \"Environmental Compliance Plan\" in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and under Environmental Laws and Regulations\u201d within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. On February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek \nrecovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved.\nAdditional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving the Company's financial objectives.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015. See the Company's Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n (A) Maturities of the Company's long-term debt during the next five years consist of $110.2 million, $225.2 million, $250.1 million, $250.1 million and $0.1 million in years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. \n (B) Includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for OG&E's railcar operating lease obligations, OG&E's expected cogeneration energy payments, OG&E's minimum fuel purchase commitments and OG&E's expected wind purchase commitments. \nOG&E also has 440 MWs of QF contracts to meet its current and future expected customer needs. OG&E will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these QF contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers, including exercising its options (if applicable) to extend these QF contracts at pre-determined rates.\nThe actual cost of fuel used in electric generation (which includes the operating lease obligations for OG&E's railcar leases shown above) and certain purchased power costs are passed through to OG&E's customers through fuel adjustment clauses. Accordingly, while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of minimum fuel purchase commitments of OG&E noted above may increase capital requirements, such costs are recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses and have little, if any, impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations. The fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2015, 35.5 percent of the Pension Plan investments were in listed common stocks with the balance primarily invested in U.S. Government securities, bonds, debentures and notes, and a commingled fund as presented in Note 12\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2015, asset losses on the Pension Plan were 3.9 percent due to the losses in fixed income and equity investments. During the same time, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, decreased. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. The Company has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. The Company could be required to make additional contributions if the value of its pension trust and postretirement benefit plan trust assets are adversely impacted by a major market disruption in the future.\nThe following table presents the status of the Company's Pension Plan, the Restoration of Retirement Income Plan and the postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts have been recorded in Accrued Benefit Obligations with the offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (except OG&E's portion which is recorded as a regulatory asset as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and those recorded as a regulatory asset represent a net periodic benefit cost to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods.\n\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits,\" a one-time settlement charge is required to be recorded by an organization when lump sum payments or other settlements that relieve the organization from the responsibility for the pension benefit obligation during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the organization's net periodic pension cost. During 2015, the Company experienced an increase in both the number of employees electing to retire and the amount of lump sum payments to be paid to such employees upon retirement. As a result, the Company recorded pension settlement charges of $16.2 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which $14.0 million related to OG&E's Oklahoma jurisdiction and has been included in the pension tracker. The pension settlement charge did not require a cash outlay by the Company and did not increase the Company's total pension expense over time, as the charges were an acceleration of costs that otherwise would be recognized as pension expense in future periods.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe Company's dividend policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors at least annually and is based on numerous factors, including management's estimation of the long-term earnings power of its businesses. The Company's financial objective includes dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. At the Company's September 2015 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.27500 per share from $0.25000 per share effective in October 2015.\nSecurity Ratings\n\nAccess to reasonably priced capital is dependent in part on credit and security ratings. Generally, lower ratings lead to higher financing costs. Pricing grids associated with the Company's credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of the Company's short-term borrowings, but a reduction in the Company's credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require the Company to post collateral or letters of credit.\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the credit rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nFuture financing requirements may be dependent, to varying degrees, upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions, abnormal weather, load growth, commodity prices, acquisitions of other businesses and/or development of projects, actions by rating agencies, inflation, changes in environmental laws or regulations, rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies, new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators.\n2015 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities\nTotal capital requirements, consisting of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt, were $548.0 million and contractual obligations, net of recoveries through fuel adjustment clauses, were $85.6 million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of $633.6 million in 2015, of which $130.6 million was to comply with environmental regulations. This compares to net capital requirements of $809.5 million and net contractual obligations of $88.2 million totaling $897.7 million in 2014, of which $31.5 million was to comply with environmental regulations.\nIn 2015, the Company's sources of capital were cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of short and long-term debt, proceeds from the sales of common stock and distributions from Enable. Changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the Company's business, the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories. See \"Working Capital\" for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\nDerivative instruments are utilized in managing OG&E's commodity price exposures. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a new regulatory regime for derivatives, including mandatory clearing of certain swaps and margin requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end-users such as OG&E from much of the clearing requirements. The regulations require that the decision on whether to use the end-user exception from mandatory clearing for derivative transactions be reviewed and approved by an \"appropriate committee\" of the Board of Directors. On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act that exempts from margin requirements swaps used by end-users to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. There are, however, some rulemakings that have no yet been finalized. Even if OG&E qualifies for the end-user exception to clearing and margin requirements are not imposed on end-users, its derivative counterparties may be subject to new capital, margin and business conduct requirements as a result of the new regulations, which may increase OG&E's transaction costs or make it more difficult to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms. OG&E's inability to enter into derivative transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and put OG&E at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in commodities prices. The impact of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act on OG&E cannot be fully determined at this time due to uncertainty over forthcoming regulations and potential changes to the derivatives markets arising from new regulatory requirements.\nFuture Sources of Financing\nManagement expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt, proceeds from other offerings and distributions from Enable will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. The Company utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper) to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged.\nShort-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\nShort-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling in the aggregate $1,150.0 million. These bank facilities can also be used as letter of credit facilities. Short-term debt had no balance at December 31, 2015 compared to a balance of $98.0 million at December 31, 2014. The average balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $75.2 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.46 percent. The maximum month-end balance of short-term debt in 2015 was $180.0 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,148.1 million of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreements. OG&E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to $800.0 million in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31,\n2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $75.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity.\nIn December 2011, the Company and OG&E entered into unsecured five-year revolving credit agreements to total in the aggregate $1,150.0 million ($750.0 million for the Company and $400.0 million for OG&E). Each of the credit facilities contained an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company and OG&E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of their credit agreements from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company and OG&E utilized their second extension to extend the maturity of their respective credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, commitments of approximately $16.3 million and $8.7 million of the Company's and OG&E's credit facilities, respectively, however, were not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, such commitments will expire December 13, 2017.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company does not expect to issue any common stock in 2016 from its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's common stock activity.\nDistributions by Enable\nPursuant to the Enable limited partnership agreement, the amount of distributions the Company received from Enable were $139.3 million and $143.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Management's Discussion and Analysis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company believes it has taken reasonable positions where assumptions and estimates are used in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the Company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates. In management's opinion, the areas of the Company where the most significant judgment is exercised for all Company segments includes the determination of Pension Plan assumptions, income taxes, contingency reserves, asset retirement obligations and depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment. For the electric utility segment, significant judgment is also exercised in the determination of regulatory assets and liabilities and unbilled revenues. The selection, application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the Company's Audit Committee. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates, in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of the Company's employees hired before December 1, 2009. Also, effective December 1, 2009, the Company's Pension Plan is no longer being offered to employees hired on or after December 1, 2009. The Company also has defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of its employees. Pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and the level of funding. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. The pension plan rate assumptions are shown in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumed return on plan assets is based on management's expectation of the long-term return on the plan assets portfolio. The discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid. The level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates. Higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the Pension Plan. The following table indicates the sensitivity of the Pension Plan funded status to these variables.\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry forwards and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. Accordingly, it is necessary to make judgments regarding income tax exposure. As a result, changes in these judgments can materially affect amounts the Company recognized in its consolidated financial statements. Tax positions taken by the Company on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more likely than not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has previously recorded asset retirement obligations that are being amortized over their respective lives ranging from three to 74 years. The inputs used in the valuation of asset retirement obligations include the assumed life of the asset placed into service, the average inflation rate, market risk premium, the credit-adjusted risk free interest rate and the timing of incurring costs related to the retirement of the asset.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.\nOG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. The benefit obligations regulatory asset is comprised of expenses recorded which are probable of future recovery and that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, including net loss and prior service cost.\nUnbilled Revenues\nOG&E recognizes revenue from electric sales when power is delivered to customers. OG&E reads its customers' meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month. As a result, there is a significant amount of customers' electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month. OG&E accrues an estimate of the revenues for electric sales delivered since the latest billings. Unbilled revenue is presented in Accrued Unbilled Revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. At December 31, 2015, if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent, this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of $0.3 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Accrued Unbilled Revenues were $53.5 million and $55.5 million, respectively. The estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nCustomer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OG&E is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized. Also, a portion of the uncollectible provision related to fuel within the Oklahoma jurisdiction is being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. At December 31, 2015, if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by 10 percent, this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of $0.1 million. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to Accounts Receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is included in the Other Operation and Maintenance Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $1.4 million and $1.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of current accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits or claims made by third parties, including governmental agencies. When appropriate, management consults with legal counsel and other experts to assess the claim. If, in management's opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. At the present time, based on available information, the Company believes that any reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued amounts arising out of pending or threatened lawsuits or claims would not be quantitatively material to its financial statements and would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Notes 14 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3 of Part I in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards.\nEnvironmental regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation of OG&E's facilities. Historically, OG&E's total expenditures for environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes, however, that it is likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will continue towards more restrictive standards. Compliance with these standards is expected to increase the cost of conducting business. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market.\nOG&E expects that environmental expenditures necessary to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will qualify as part of a pre-approval plan to handle state and Federally mandated environmental upgrades which will be recoverable in Oklahoma from OG&E's retail customers under House Bill 1910, which was enacted into law in May 2005.\nIt is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2016 will be $195.9 million, of which $178.3 million is for capital expenditures. It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2017 will be approximately $166.7 million, of which $148.7 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E above include capital expenditures for low NOX burners and dry scrubbers.\nAir\nFederal Clean Air Act Overview\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating units, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that OG&E obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or install emission control equipment. OG&E likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and technology in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nRegional Haze Control Measures\nThe EPA's 2005 regional haze rule is intended to protect visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United States that may be impacted by air pollutant emissions.\nOn February 18, 2010, Oklahoma submitted its SIP to the EPA, which set forth the state's plan for compliance with the Federal regional haze rule. The SIP was subject to the EPA's review and approval.\nThe Oklahoma SIP included requirements for reducing emissions of NOX and SO2 from OG&E's seven BART-eligible units at the Seminole, Muskogee and Sooner generating stations. The SIP also included a waiver from BART requirements for all eligible units at the Horseshoe Lake generating station based on air modeling that showed no significant impact on visibility in nearby national parks and wilderness areas. The SIP concluded that BART for reducing NOX emissions at all of the subject units should be the installation of low NOX burners with overfired air (flue gas recirculation was also required on two of the units) and set forth associated NOX emission rates and limits.\nOn December 28, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule in which it rejected the SO2 portion of the Oklahoma SIP and issued a FIP in its place. OG&E and the State of Oklahoma's subsequent appeal of the FIP with the Tenth Circuit of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court ended on May 27, 2014 when the Supreme Court denied OG&E's Petition for Certiorari, upholding the EPA's FIP for SO2. The FIP compliance date is now January 4, 2019.\nOn December 9, 2015, the EPA released a final rule partially disapproving the revisions to the 2010 Oklahoma SIP for Regional Haze and promulgated FIPs in their place for Oklahoma and Texas. The EPA disapproved portions of the Oklahoma SIP related to the establishment of Reasonable Progress Goals for the Class I area located within the state and promulgated revised Reasonable Progress Goals based on the FIP implementation in Texas. As a result, no further requirements are required in Oklahoma to meet the 2018 Reasonable Progress Goals for Oklahoma.\nOn August 6, 2014, OG&E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application seeks approval of the environmental compliance plan and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asked the OCC to predetermine the prudence of replacing OG&E's soon-to-be retired Mustang steam turbines in late 2017 with 400 MWs of new, efficient combustion turbines at the Mustang site in 2018 and 2019 and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. OG&E estimates the total capital cost associated with its environmental compliance plan included in this application to be approximately $1.1 billion. The OCC hearing on OG&E's application before an ALJ began on March 3, 2015 and concluded on April 8, 2015. Multiple parties advocating a variety of positions intervened in the proceeding.\nOn June 8, 2015, the ALJ issued his report on OG&E's application. While the ALJ in his report agreed that the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas pursuant to OG&E's ECP is the best approach, the ALJ's report included several recommendations. OG&E filed exceptions to the ALJ's report and on July 21, 2015, Commissioner Bob Anthony issued his deliberation statement that was consistent with many parts of the ALJ's report, including the ALJ's support of OG&E's ECP, the ALJ's recommendation to pre-approve certain estimated costs of the environmental recovery plan, and the ALJ's recommendation to defer all other cost recovery issues until the next general rate case.\nOn December 2, 2015, OG&E received an order from the OCC denying, by a two to one vote, its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider.\nOn December 11, 2015, OG&E filed a motion requesting modification of the OCC order for the purposes of approving only the ECP. OG&E did not seek modification to any other provisions of the OCC order, including cost recovery. OG&E also agreed that it would not implement a rider for recovery of the costs of the ECP until and unless authorized by the OCC in a subsequent proceeding.\nOn December 23, 2015, the OCC rejected, by a two to one vote, a proposal by Commissioner Dana Murphy to grant OG&E's December 11, 2015 motion.\nOn February 12, 2016, OG&E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E had incurred $94.8 million of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&E estimates another $35.0 million of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule\nIn August 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR that required 27 states in the eastern half of the United States to reduce power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and particulate matter pollution in other states. In December 2011, the EPA published a supplemental CSAPR, which would make six additional states, including Oklahoma, subject to the CSAPR for NOX emissions during the ozone-season from May 1 through September 30. Under the rule, OG&E would have been required to reduce ozone-season NOX emissions from its electrical generating units within the state beginning in 2012. In response to legal challenges of the final rule on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a stay of the rule, which includes the supplemental rule, pending a decision on the merits. By order dated August 21, 2012, the Court of Appeals vacated the CSAPR and ordered the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals. On October 23, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the EPA's request that the court lift the stay of the CSAPR. The EPA subsequently clarified that compliance with the CSAPR would begin in 2015 using the amount of allowances originally scheduled to be available in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, OG&E has installed five low NOX burner systems on two Muskogee units, two Sooner units and one Seminole unit and is in compliance with the final rule. In the meantime, the petitions\nfor review of the supplemental rule remain pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of issues that are not addressed by the Supreme Court's decision.\nOn December 3, 2015, the EPA proposed an update to CSAPR finding that ozone-season NOX emissions in 23 eastern states including Oklahoma affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain ozone standards and proposing to issue FIPs to update the existing NOX ozone-season emission budgets for electrical generating units. The proposed rule reduces OG&E's NOX emissions requirements under the current CSAPR by 25 percent. Compliance is proposed to begin in May 2017. OG&E continues to evaluate what additional measures, if any, will be needed for compliance with the new rule.\nHazardous Air Pollutants Emission Standards\nOn February 16, 2012, the EPA published the final MATS rule regulating the emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units, which became effective April 16, 2012. The final rule uses a numerical standard to establish limits for particulate matter (as a surrogate for toxic metals), hydrogen chloride and mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. Compliance was required within three years of the rule's effective date. Based on OG&E's request for a one-year extension, the deadline for compliance was extended to April 16, 2016. To comply with this rule, OG&E utilized activated carbon injections at each of its five coal-fired units during 2015.\nThe final MATS rule was appealed by several parties, but OG&E was not a party to the appeals. After withstanding judicial scrutiny at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, the MATS rule was challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the EPA should have considered the compliance costs imposed on utilities at the first stage of the EPA's regulatory analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the rule, but reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision and remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. The MATS rule currently remains in effect and OG&E is still required to meet the April 2016 compliance deadline.\nFederal Clean Air Act New Source Review Litigation\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, OG&E received a request for information from the EPA regarding Federal Clean Air Act compliance at OG&E's Muskogee and Sooner generating plants.\nOn July 8, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against OG&E in United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E did not follow the Federal Clean Air Act procedures for projecting emission increases attributable to eight projects that occurred between 2003 and 2006. This complaint seeks to have OG&E submit a new assessment of whether the projects were likely to result in a significant emissions increase. The Sierra Club intervened in this proceeding. On August 30, 2013, the government filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and on September 6, 2013, OG&E filed a Motion to Dismiss the case. On January 15, 2015, U.S. District Judge Timothy DeGuisti dismissed the complaints filed by the EPA and the Sierra Club. The Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims because plaintiffs failed to present an actual case or controversy\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court also ruled in the alternative that, even if plaintiffs had presented a case or controversy, it would have nonetheless decline[d] to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d The EPA and the Sierra Club did not file an appeal of the Court's ruling.\nOn August 12, 2013, the Sierra Club filed a separate complaint against OG&E in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging that OG&E projects at Muskogee Unit 6 in 2008 were made without obtaining a prevention of significant deterioration permit and that the plant had exceeded emissions limits for opacity and particulate matter. The Sierra Club seeks a permanent injunction preventing OG&E from operating the Muskogee generating plant. On March 4, 2014, the Eastern District dismissed the prevention of significant deterioration permit claim based on the statute of limitations, but allowed the opacity and particulate matter claims to proceed. To obtain the right to appeal this decision, the Sierra Club subsequently withdrew a Notice of Intent to Sue for additional Clean Air Act violations and asked the Eastern District to dismiss its remaining claims with prejudice. On August 27, 2014, the Eastern District granted the Sierra Club's request. The Sierra Club has filed a Notice of Appeal with the 10th Circuit where oral argument was held on March 18, 2015.\nAt this time, OG&E continues to believe that it has acted in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act, and OG&E expects to vigorously defend against the claims that have been asserted. If OG&E does not prevail in the remainder of the proceedings, the EPA and the Sierra Club could seek to require OG&E to install additional pollution control equipment, including dry scrubbers, baghouses and selective catalytic reduction systems with capital costs in excess of $1.1 billion and pay fines and significant penalties as a result of the allegations in the notice of violation. Section 113 of the Federal Clean Air Act (along with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1996) provides for civil penalties as much as $37,500 per day for each violation. Due to the uncertain and preliminary nature of this litigation, OG&E cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss in this case.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nThe EPA is required to set NAAQS for certain pollutants considered to be harmful to public health or the environment. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review each NAAQS every five years. As a result of these reviews, the EPA periodically has taken action to adopt more stringent NAAQS for those pollutants. If any areas of Oklahoma were to be designated as not attaining the NAAQS for a particular pollutant, the Company could be required to install additional emission controls on its facilities to help the state achieve attainment with the NAAQS. As of the end of 2015, no areas of Oklahoma had been designated as non-attainment for pollutants that are likely to affect the Company's operations. Several processes are under way to designate areas in Oklahoma as attaining or not attaining revised NAAQS. The Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nIn August of 2013, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a complaint under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Air Act based on the EPA's failure to promulgate and publish designations for the 2010 revised primary SO2 NAAQS. On March 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order granting the EPA and the Sierra Club's joint motion to approve and enter a consent decree that set forth mandatory deadlines for the EPA to issue designations for all areas of the country that remained undesignated. On September 18, 2015 the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality reported to the EPA that no areas in Oklahoma should be designated as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 standard. This non-attainment designation is subject to the EPA's approval. In a letter dated February 11, 2016, EPA Region 6 notified Oklahoma of their intent to designate part of Muskogee County in which OG&E's Muskogee Power Plant is located, as non-attainment for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS. EPA is expected to finalize this designation in July, 2016 following public comment. This could require additional controls scrubbers on the affected units. On August 21, 2015, EPA finalized a data requirements rule for implementing the 2010 SO2 standard requiring air agencies to characterize air quality around sources that emit 2,000 tons per year or more of SO2 via air quality modeling or ambient air monitoring. In July 2016, air agencies will be required to identify either ambient monitoring or air quality modeling as a method for characterizing air quality for 2,000 tons per year or larger sources. At this time, OG&E cannot determine with any certainty whether this determination will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nOn September 30, 2015 the EPA finalized a new ambient standard for ozone at 70 ppb which is more stringent than the current standard of 75 ppb, set in 2008. States must submit non-attainment designations as appropriate based on existing ambient data before October 2016 for the EPA's approval. Compliance with the new standard begins in 2020 or later depending on the degree of the area's non-attainment designation. All areas in Oklahoma currently meet the new standard.\nThe Company is monitoring those processes and their possible impact on its operations but, at this time, cannot determine with any certainty whether they will cause a material impact to the Company's financial results.\nClean Power Plan\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan that established standards of performance for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants along with state-specific CO2 reduction standards expressed as both rate-based (lbs/MWh) and mass-based (tons/yr) goals. The 2030 rate-based reduction requirement for all existing generating units in Oklahoma has decreased from a proposed 43 percent reduction to 32 percent in the final rule. The mass-based approach for existing units calls for a 24 percent reduction by 2030 in Oklahoma. The Clean Power Plan requires that states submit to the EPA plans for achieving the state-specific CO2 reduction goals by September 6, 2016 or submit an extension request for up to two years. The compliance period was to begin in 2022, and emission reductions were to be phased in by 2030. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that an approvable state plan was not submitted to the EPA by the required deadline.\nA number of states have filed lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of challenges to the rule. The Company is unable to determine what impact the lawsuits will ultimately have on the Clean Power Plan or what impact the stay in implementation will have; however, if the Clean Power Plan survives judicial review and is implemented as written, it could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Significant uncertainties would remain with regards to potential implementation in Oklahoma (and the federal plan that would be imposed by the EPA for states that do not submit approvable plans), including whether states would elect an emissions standards approach versus a state measures approach, whether and what type of emissions trading would be allowed, and available cost mitigation options. Due to the pending litigation and the uncertainties in the state approaches, the ultimate timing and impact of these standards on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time.\nClimate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThere is continuing discussion and evaluation of possible global climate change in certain regulatory and legislative arenas. The focus is generally on emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2, sulfur hexafluoride and methane, and whether these emissions are contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere. In December 2015, as part of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States committed to reduce economy wide emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 emission levels. This multinational agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and \"represent a progression\" every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement could result in future additional emissions reductions in the United States, however, it is not possible to determine what the international legal standards for greenhouse gas emissions will be in the future and the extent to which commitments under the December 2015 Paris Agreement will be implemented through the Clean Air Act, other than existing statutes and new legislation.\nSeveral states have passed laws, adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs.\nIf legislation or regulations are passed at the Federal or state levels in the future requiring mandatory reductions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on the Company's facilities, this could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect the Company's future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nIn 2009, the EPA adopted a comprehensive national system for reporting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases produced by major sources in the United States. The reporting requirements apply to large direct emitters of greenhouse gases with emissions equal to or greater than a threshold of 25,000 metric tons per year, which includes certain OG&E facilities. OG&E also reports quarterly its CO2 emissions from generating units subject to the Federal Acid Rain Program. OG&E has submitted the reports required by the applicable reporting rules.\nNonetheless, OG&E's current business strategy will result in a reduced carbon emissions rate compared to current levels. As discussed in Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d, OG&E has filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze FIP by converting two coal-fired generating units at Muskogee Station to natural gas, among other measures. OG&E's deployment of Smart Grid technology helps to reduce the peak load demand. OG&E also seeks to utilize renewable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. OG&E's service territory borders one of the nation's best wind resource areas. OG&E has leveraged its geographic position to develop renewable energy resources and completed transmission investments to deliver the renewable energy. The SPP has begun to authorize the construction of transmission lines capable of bringing renewable energy out of the wind resource area in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and western Kansas to load centers by planning for more transmission to be built in the area. In addition to increasing overall system reliability, these new transmission resources should provide greater access to additional wind resources that are currently constrained due to existing transmission delivery limitations.\nEPA Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction Policy\nOn May 22, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule to address the outdated provisions in the SIP of 36 states, including Oklahoma, regarding the treatment of emissions that occur during startup, shutdown and malfunction operations. The final rule clarifies the EPA's Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction Policy to assure consistency with the Clean Air Act and other recent court decisions. The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality is in the process of developing a SIP to comply with this rule, which is to be submitted to the EPA before November 2016. Although the extent of impact is not known, this rule will impact certain OG&E units.\nEndangered Species\nCertain Federal laws, including the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, provide special protection to certain designated species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for unpermitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals and plants, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which the Company conducts operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, the Company's operations and development projects, particularly transmission, wind or pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or the Company could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nIn 2014, the Company enrolled in the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies range-wide conservation plan which consists of industry-specific conservation practices that apply to projects and activities in the impacted area. The range-wide\nconservation plan was approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and incorporated as part of the agency's final decision on March 27, 2014 to list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. On September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court Western District of Texas vacated federal protections for the lesser prairie chicken based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's failure to thoroughly consider the active conservation efforts in making the listing decision.\nAir Quality Control System\nOn September 10, 2014, OG&E executed a contract for the design, engineering and fabrication of two circulating dry scrubber systems to be installed at Sooner Units 1 and 2. OG&E entered into an agreement on February 9, 2015, to install the dry scrubber systems. The dry scrubbers are part of OG&E's ECP and scheduled to be completed by 2019. More detail regarding the ECP can be found under the Pending Regulatory Matters\u201d section of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWaste\nOG&E's operations generate wastes that are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as well as comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste.\nOn December 19, 2014, the EPA finalized a rule under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals or coal ash. The final rule regulates coal ash as a solid waste rather than a hazardous waste, which would have made the management of coal ash more costly. OG&E has evaluated the potential impacts of the final rule on our ash ponds and has set up a reserve based on a reasonable estimate.\nThe Company has sought and will continue to seek pollution prevention opportunities and to evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2015, the Company obtained refunds of $2.3 million from the recycling of scrap metal, salvaged transformers and used transformer oil. This figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years.\nWater\nOG&E's operations are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and Federal waters.\nThe EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014 to implement Section 316(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, which requires that power plant cooling water intake structure location, design, construction and capacity reflect the best available technology for minimizing their adverse environmental impact via the impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The EPA issued a final rule on May 19, 2014. OG&E submitted compliance plans to the state in April 2015. OG&E expects to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of any material costs associated with the rule's implementation.\nSite Remediation\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Because OG&E utilizes various products and generate wastes that are considered hazardous substances for purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, OG&E could be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where those substances have been released to the environment. At this time, it is not anticipated that any associated liability will cause a significant impact to OG&E.\nFor a further discussion regarding contingencies relating to environmental laws and

$395.8 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from its investment in Enable Midstream Partners and higher costs at OG&E.\n\n- OG&E's earnings decreased due to higher depreciation expense, lower gross margins from milder weather and decreased wholesale transmission revenues, partially offset by customer growth.\n\n- The natural gas midstream segment earnings decreased significantly due to Enable's goodwill impairment charge in 2015 and lower revenues driven by lower natural gas and NGL prices.\n\n- OG&E faces significant environmental compliance costs related to regulations like the Clean Air Act's Regional Haze rule and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Its environmental compliance plan to address these includes installing emissions controls at power plants.\n\n- Contractual obligations and capital expenditures are expected to be funded through operating cash flows, debt issuances, equity issuances and distributions from Enable Midstream Partners.\n\n- The company has adequate liquidity currently but its financial condition and results could be negatively impacted if environmental compliance costs are not recovered through regulated rates."}
