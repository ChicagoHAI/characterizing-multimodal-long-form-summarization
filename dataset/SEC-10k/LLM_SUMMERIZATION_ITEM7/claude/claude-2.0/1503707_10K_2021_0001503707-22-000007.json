Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements\u201d and the risk factors in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d References to we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or NorthStar Healthcare\u201d refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nBusiness Summary\nWe have invested in independent living facilities, or ILFs, assisted living facilities, or ALFs, memory care facilities, or MCFs, and continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, which we collectively refer to as seniors housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, medical office buildings, or MOBs, and hospitals.\nOur primary investment segments are as follows:\n\u2022Direct Investments - Operating - Healthcare properties operated pursuant to management agreements with healthcare managers.\n\u2022Direct Investments - Net Lease - Healthcare properties operated under net leases with an operator.\n\u2022Unconsolidated Investments - Healthcare joint ventures, including properties operated under net leases with an operator or pursuant to management agreements with healthcare managers, in which we own a minority interest.\n\u2022Debt Investments - Mortgage loans or mezzanine loans to owners of healthcare real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one mezzanine loan, which was repaid in August 2021.\nFor information regarding our investments as of December 31, 2021, refer to Our Investments\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Update\nInvestments, Financings and Disposition Activities\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 marked a pivotal and transitional period for our business, portfolio composition and liquidity. The following is a summary of significant investment, financing and disposition activities during the year:\n\u2022In December 2021, we completed the sale of the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios for $580.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $114.0 million after the repayment of mortgage notes, which totaled $450.7 million and payment of transaction and other costs, distributions to non-controlling interests, and releases of reserves and other prorations.\n\u2022In August 2021, the outstanding principal balance of our mezzanine loan was repaid in full. Principal repayments received during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $74.4 million, which includes payment-in-kind interest. The borrower funded these principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\n\u2022In July 2021, we repaid, in full, the $35.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit from an affiliate of our Sponsor, or the Sponsor Line.\n\u2022In June 2021, we completed the sale of the Kansas City portfolio, which generated net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million.\n\u2022In May 2021, we completed the sale of the Smyrna net lease property, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million.\n\u2022In April 2021, we extended the maturity date of a mortgage note payable for a property within the Rochester portfolio to August 2022 and made a $1.0 million principal repayment.\n\u2022In March 2021, we completed the sale of a property within the Aqua portfolio for $22.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $0.9 million, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage principal balance of $20.1 million and transaction costs.\n\u2022In January 2021, we refinanced an existing $18.7 million note payable, collateralized by a property within the Aqua portfolio, with a $26.0 million mortgage note payable. The new mortgage note carries a fixed interest rate of 3.0% through February 2024 and has an initial maturity date of February 2026.\nOperating Performance\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. Significant vaccine deployment helped to reduce COVID-19 infections and transmissions within our communities, which in turn, improved demand, led to an improvement in resident occupancy at our communities during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and reduced preventative operating costs.\nWe continue to see increased demand and lead generation for our communities and remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for the seniors housing industry, but anticipate the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operational and financial performance of our business, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time. New variants of the virus, which may increase reported infection rates, along with labor and inflationary pressures on costs, may further interfere with the general economic recovery.\nAt this time, the progression of the global economic recovery from the broad effects of the pandemic is difficult to assess and estimate the future impact on our results of operations. Accordingly, any estimates of the effects of COVID-19 as reflected or discussed are based upon our best estimates using information known to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such estimates may change in the future, the effects of which could be material.\nThe following is a summary of the performance of our investment segments for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For additional information on financial results, refer to -Results of Operations.\u201d\nDirect Investments - Operating\nThe impact of COVID-19 resulted in occupancy levels nearing historical lows across our direct operating investments at the beginning of 2021. While average occupancy was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, on a same store basis, our direct operating investments experienced an improved demand and an increase in the number of resident move-ins during 2021. Recent occupancy trends have shown improvements, with average monthly occupancy in December 2021 exceeding the average monthly occupancy in December 2020 by 2.5%. A summary of average occupancy by manager is as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Monthly Occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Annual Occupancy </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operator / Manager </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watermark Retirement Communities(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>77.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Solstice Senior Living </td> <td> </td> <td>77.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Avamere Health Services </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integral Senior Living(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>88.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Investments - Operating </td> <td> </td> <td>77.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Average monthly and annual occupancy excludes properties sold.\nOn a same store basis, rental and resident fee income of our direct operating investments declined to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $163.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, average annual occupancy for our direct operating investments declined by 2.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020. However, declines in revenue from lower occupancy were partially offset by rate increases. While occupancy improved during the second half of 2021, our direct operating investments' occupancy levels remain below pre-pandemic averages.\nOn a same store basis, excluding COVID-19 related expenses, property operating expenses of our direct operating investments increased to $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to experience staffing challenges and, in turn, salaries and wages expense has increased due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, sales and marketing expenses have increased with the improved volume of resident move-ins, while the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our managers to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nOverall, on a same store basis, rental and resident fee income, net of property operating expenses, of our direct operating investments decreased to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur direct operating investments incurred COVID-19 related expenses totaling $4.4 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our direct operating investments received and recognized grant income totaling $7.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, from the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. These grants are intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nDirect Investments - Net Lease\nOn a same store basis, we recognized $3.4 million of rental income from our direct net lease investments during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $10.1 million recognized in 2020, excluding straight-line rental adjustments in both periods. A summary of rental income from our direct net lease investments is as follows:\n\u2022The operator of our Arbors portfolio has failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other lease conditions. Contractual monthly rent obligations have been remitted through April 2021 and we have recorded rental income to the extent rental payments were received during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022We sold our Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio in December 2021. The operator remitted full contractual rent per the amended terms of its lease through November 2021. In April 2021, we executed a lease modification that allowed the operator to defer up to $3.0 million of contractual rent payments over the remaining term of the lease, which were forgiven upon the sale of the portfolio.\n\u2022We sold our Smyrna property in May 2021. No rental income was received or recognized from the operator during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnconsolidated Investments\nOverall, our unconsolidated investment portfolios experienced similar operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic as our direct operating investments. Equity in earnings totaled $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to equity in losses of $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Equity in earnings includes our proportionate share of net gains from sales transactions in the Espresso and Eclipse joint ventures, which totaled $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These sales resulted in lower rental income recognized by the joint ventures during the year ended December 31, 2021. Equity in losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes our proportionate share of impairment losses recorded by the underlying joint ventures of our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $38.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we received distributions from our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $18.1 million as compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in distributions is primarily a result of increased sales activity during the year ended December 31, 2021. Distributions continued to be limited by reinvestment and development in the Trilogy joint venture, operational challenges in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures and debt repayments in the Espresso joint venture.\nThe following is a summary of operations and performance for the Trilogy, Diversified US/UK, and Espresso joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\u2022Trilogy: Labor shortages, resulting in additional overtime and agency staffing, continued to impact the operations of the predominantly SNF portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, less federal COVID-19 provider relief grants were received and recognized as income during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. While challenged throughout 2021, occupancy and financial results improved during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022Espresso: The joint venture received full contractual rent from its net lease operators during the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, the joint venture resumed distributions to its partners for the first time since the second quarter of 2017. During 2021, the portfolio sold 43 properties, or 28% of the portfolio. Net proceeds from the sales were used to repay our mezzanine loan originated to the joint venture. Refer to -Business Update\u201d for further detail on the mezzanine loan repayment.\n\u2022Diversified US/UK: The joint venture received substantially all contractual monthly rent from its net lease and MOB tenants in the United States during the year ended December 31, 2021. SNF and ALF operating portfolios sustained suboptimal occupancy levels and experienced staffing challenges resulting from the continued broad effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The operator of the joint venture's net lease portfolio in the United Kingdom experienced similar effects of the pandemic on its operations, which resulted in a lease modification and lower rental income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $4.7 million, a decrease from $7.7 million for the ended year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the loan being repaid in full in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a discussion of material events which have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2021 through March 17, 2022.\nSponsor Transaction\nOn February 28, 2022, our former Sponsor, DigitalBridge Group, Inc., or our Former Sponsor, completed the previously announced disposition of its wellness infrastructure platform, or the Sponsor Transaction, which included CNI NSHC Advisors, LLC, or our Advisor, and the individuals currently engaged in the management and oversight of the healthcare platform. The sale resulted in a change of the owner and control of our Advisor to NRF Holdco, LLC, or NRF or our New Sponsor, but did not directly impact the ownership or control of us or any of our assets.\nAdvisory Agreement\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for a one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022 upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but removed our Former Sponsor as the Sponsor and added NRF as the New Sponsor.\nSponsor Line of Credit\nOn February 28, 2022, our Sponsor Line was amended to extend the maturity date to February 28, 2024.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe healthcare industry, which includes ILFs, ALFs, MCFs, CCRCs, SNFs, MOBs and hospitals, continues to experience the effects of COVID-19, including declines in resident occupancy, lower operating cash flows and compressed operating margins.\nThe CARES Act has provided over $100 billion in grants to eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Licensed assisted living providers became eligible to apply for funding under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 2 General Distribution allocation and remain eligible under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 3 and Phase 4 General Distributions. In addition, the CMS has provided accelerated and advance payments to Medicare providers. Operators continue to evaluate their options for financial assistance, such as utilizing programs within the CARES Act as well as other state and local government relief programs. However, the uncertainty regarding future availability of such relief, and its ultimate impact, including the extent to which relief funds from such programs will provide meaningful support for lost revenue and increasing costs, is uncertain. Additionally, although we continue to evaluate and monitor the terms and conditions associated with relief programs, we cannot ensure ultimate compliance with all the requirements related to the assistance received. If any of our operators fail to comply with all of the terms and conditions, they may be required to repay some or all of the grants received and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nHealthcare industry operating results will continue to be impacted to the extent occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels. Further, the healthcare industry anticipates operating margins will continue to be impacted by cost inflation, labor pressures, additional staffing needs and related cost burdens.\nThe healthcare industry's operational and financial recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 will depend on a variety of factors, which may differ considerably across regions, fluctuate over time and are highly uncertain. The healthcare industry experienced a higher pace of move-ins during the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the third quarter of 2021. As a result of overall increase in resident demand, improving consumer sentiment and easing restrictions on visitation and admissions, the seniors housing industry occupancy average rose to 81.0% during the fourth quarter of 2021 from 80.1% in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, annual inventory growth decreased to 2.4% during the fourth quarter of 2021, while construction versus inventory ratio of 5.2% remained elevated in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: The National Investment Centers for Seniors Housing & Care, or NIC).\nSeniors Housing\nNotwithstanding the demographics and forecasted spending growth, economic and healthcare market uncertainty, development, and competitive pressures have had a negative impact on the seniors housing industry, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing operating income for managers and operators.\nSupply growth, which has outpaced demand, has challenged the seniors housing industry over the past several years. New inventory, coupled with the average move-in age of seniors housing residents increasing over time, has resulted in declining occupancy for the industry on average. Further, to remain competitive with the new supply, owners and operators of older facilities have increased capital expenditure spending, which in turn has negatively affected cash flow. While off its peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory was 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: NIC). It is expected that, as demographics and demand continues to increase long-term, supply growth will follow.\nAs a result of increased supply, the seniors housing industry has experienced competitive pressures that have limited rent growth over the past several years. Average market rent growth reached its peak of 4.2% in 2016 and has since decreased to 2.3% as of the fourth quarter of 2021, with pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the decline (source: NIC). Limited future supply growth and reestablishing normal operations in a post-pandemic environment will be factors in achieving near and long term revenue growth for the industry.\nFurther, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff had resulted in increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated operating expense growth, with increased staffing needs and personal protective equipment requirements. While it is expected that the increases in expenses to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be temporary, wage and benefits increases may continue to impact the industry's margins in the future, as labor represents 60% of the seniors housing industry's operating expenses (source: Green Street).\nSkilled Nursing\nWhile generally impacted by the same conditions as the seniors housing industry, SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges. Increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with inspections, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims have contributed to compressed margins and declines in cash flow.\nSNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancy and declining operating margins, liquidity and financial conditions.\nOn February 28, 2022, the White House announced a set of reforms, developed by and implemented through HHS, aimed at improving safety and quality of nursing home care. The new initiatives include establishing a minimum nursing home staffing requirement, reducing resident room crowding and reinforcing safeguards against unnecessary medications and treatments. To ensure compliance, in addition to increased government inspections, the White House Administration plans to expand the financial penalties and other enforcement sanctions against facilities not meeting the set standards. These reforms might further increase the cost burdens for our SNF operators and expose them to financial penalties.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time.\nFor a summary of our accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe highlight below accounting estimates that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations and/or require significant management judgment and assumptions:\n\u2022Impairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. Fair values can be estimated based upon the income capitalization approach, using net operating income for each property and applying indicative capitalization and discount rates or sales comparison approach, using what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as price for comparable properties.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment losses totaling $5.4 million on our operating real estate, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio, as a result of lower estimated future cash flows and market value, and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated impairment losses of $145.1 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2021. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not impair any of our investments in unconsolidated ventures. The Eclipse joint venture recorded impairment losses, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.8 million.\nDue to uncertainties over the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, it is difficult to assess and estimate the further economic effects of COVID-19 with any meaningful precision. As the future impact of COVID-19 will depend on many factors beyond our control and knowledge, the resulting effect on impairment of our operating real estate and investments in unconsolidated ventures may materially differ from our current expectations and further impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nResults of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. We continue to monitor the progression of the economic recovery from COVID-19 and its effects on our results of operations and assess recoverability of value across our assets as conditions change.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resident fee income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income </td> <td> </td> <td>137,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,702) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property and other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>243,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,071) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>4,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,007) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>177,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>61,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset management fees -

The Watermark Fountains portfolio sold in December 2021, the Kansas City portfolio in June 2021 and a property within the Aqua portfolio sold in March 2021.\nExcluding properties sold, resident fee income increased $0.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy and rates at our Oak Cottage property.\nRental Income\nThe following table presents rental income generated by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store ILF properties (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,511) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store net lease properties (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental payments </td> <td> </td> <td>3,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,690) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight-line rental income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,350) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,826) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,644.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>18,609 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,675) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total rental income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,702) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental income decreased $19.7 million primarily due to the operator of our Arbors net lease portfolio not remitting full contractual rent during the year ended December 31, 2021, which also resulted in the write-off of straight-line rent receivables. Limited move-ins and elevated move-outs throughout the first half of 2021 resulted in lower average occupancy and rental income recognized by our ILFs. Additionally, the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio was sold in December 2021 and recognized lower contractual rent in 2021 under the amended terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is primarily interest earned on uninvested cash, which has been impacted by declining market interest rates.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment decreased as a result of receiving the full repayment of outstanding principal in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold and COVID-19 related expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>89,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,197) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>55,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,377) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, total operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily as a result of property sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Watermark Fountains portfolio sold in December 2021, the Kansas City portfolio in June 2021 and a property within the Aqua portfolio sold in March 2021. Additionally, COVID-19 related expenses were lower during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.\nExcluding properties sold and COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses increased $9.3 million, primarily as a result of our operators experiencing staffing challenges, which has increased salaries and wages due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our operators to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,151) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>3,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>18,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,788) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(208) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased $4.4 million primarily as a result of the repayment of mortgage notes payable which were collateralized by properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, average mortgage notes principal balances decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to continued principal amortization, while lower LIBOR has reduced interest expense on our floating-rate debt. Corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line, which was repaid in full in July 2021.\nAsset Management Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management fees - related party decreased $6.1 million as a result of the estimated net asset value effective December 2020 decreasing from the previous estimated net asset value effective December 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.8 million primarily as a result of amortizing our directors' and officers' insurance premium incurred and reimbursed to our Advisor over the term of the policy, beginning in December 2021. The policy premium was expensed as incurred by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we incurred non-operating costs at a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>29,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(861) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>3,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>15,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,861) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,170) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily as a result of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced building depreciation expense in 2021.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, impairment losses on operating real estate totaled $5.4 million, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses totaling $166.0 million were recorded, consisting of $84.9 million recognized for nine facilities within our Winterfell portfolio, $4.2 million for a facility within the Avamere portfolio, $12.5 million for two facilities within the Rochester portfolio and $64.4 million for properties that were sold in 2021.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $7.7 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS, partially offset by a $0.5 million non-operating loss recognized at a property within the Watermark Fountains portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS were received and recognized.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nReal estate property sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in net realized gains, which totaled $84.0 million and were partially offset by debt extinguishment losses, which totaled $8.7 million. In addition, we recognized gains on distributions that exceeded our carrying value for our investments in the Espresso and Envoy joint ventures, which totaled $4.4 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $0.3 million gain on the settlement of the share-based payment to our Advisor.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures\nThe following table presents

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in limited inquiries and tours, which significantly decreased the number of move-ins at our facilities, and increased the number of move-outs in 2020.\nEffective June 1, 2020, we granted a lease concession to the operator of the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio. The concession allowed the operator to defer a portion of contractual rent payments for a 90-day period, with full contractual rent repaid over the 12 months following the concession period. The amount of the deferred rental payments under the lease concession totaled $3.9 million. As there were no substantive changes to the original lease or changes in total cash flows, the concession was not treated as a lease modification and we continued to recognize lease income and receivables under the original terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased primarily as a result of non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio during 2019, as well as lower interest earned on uninvested cash during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income generated by our one mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $7.7 million, which was comparable to interest income recognized during year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes COVID-19 related expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,616) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>83,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,354) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>9,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, operating expenses increased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable COVID-19 related expenses, which totaled $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These expenses include personal protective equipment for residents and staff as well as wages for increased staffing and paying a premium for labor in many markets, particularly in communities that were severely impacted by COVID-19.\nExcluding COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses decreased $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower census in our direct investment operating portfolio resulted in lower utilities and food and beverage costs. Additionally, repairs and maintenance expense was lower year over year, as operators minimized all non-essential projects across our direct investment operating portfolio in response to COVID-19.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,561) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,589) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>11,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(355) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>830.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,905) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of lower average mortgage notes principal balances due to continued principal amortization and loan payoffs. In addition, lower LIBOR reduced interest expense\non our floating rate debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management and other fees - related party decreased $2.6 million as a result of the declining estimated net asset value year over year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of significant increases to insurance premiums. Further, we incurred non-operating compensation costs for a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>30,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,560) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>14,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,983) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 million, primarily as a result of intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the Winterfell and Rochester portfolios in 2019. In addition, impairment losses recognized reduced depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $166.0 million for properties with sustained poor performance, declines in occupancy and operating margins, and which have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $27.6 million. Impairment was recognized for two ALFs with sustained low occupancy within the Rochester portfolio, two poor performing properties within the Kansas City portfolio and a net lease property classified as held for sale.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS. These grants were intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 by our direct operating investments. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $0.3 million gain on the settlement of the share-based payment to our Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains totaled $6.3 million and were primarily related to the sale of two net lease properties and two condominiums units for which we held future interests in the Watermark Fountains portfolio.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures\nThe following table presents the results of our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in

excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion.\nOur proportionate share of losses generated by our unconsolidated ventures increased $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to real estate impairments recorded by the Diversified US/UK, Eclipse and Trilogy joint ventures.\nEquity in earnings, after FFO and MFFO adjustments, increased by $3.5 million. Improved performance in the Espresso joint venture, primarily due to full contractual rent collections and lower interest and operating expenses, as well as federal COVID-19 provider relief funds received and recognized by the Trilogy joint venture, were the main contributors to the increase. Non-recurring earnings recognized by the Envoy joint venture upon the completion of the sale of its remaining operating assets in 2019 and declines in operational performance in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures, as a result of the effects of COVID-19, partially offset the increase.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe believe that Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and of us in particular. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable property, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under U.S. GAAP that have been put into effect since the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in the non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO. For instance, the accounting treatment for acquisition fees related to business combinations has changed from being capitalized to being expensed. Additionally, publicly registered, non-traded REITs are typically different from traded REITs because they generally have a limited life followed by a liquidity event or other targeted exit strategy. Non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation as compared to later years when the proceeds from their initial public offering have been fully invested and when they may seek to implement a liquidity event or other exit strategy. However, it is likely that we will make investments past the acquisition and development stage, albeit at a substantially lower pace.\nAcquisition fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the origination and acquisition of debt investments have been amortized over the life of the investment as an adjustment to interest income, while fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of equity investments were generally expensed under U.S. GAAP. In both situations, the fees were included in the computation of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense), both of which are performance measures under U.S. GAAP. We adjusted MFFO for the amortization of acquisition fees in the period when such amortization was recognized under U.S. GAAP or in the period in which the acquisition fees were expensed. Acquisition fees were paid in cash that would otherwise have been available to distribute to our\nstockholders. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties. However, in general, we earned origination fees for debt investments from our borrowers in an amount equal to the acquisition fees paid to our Advisor. Effective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisition of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDue to certain of the unique features of publicly-registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA, an industry trade group, standardized a performance measure known as MFFO and recommends the use of MFFO for such REITs. Management believes MFFO is a useful performance measure to evaluate our business and further believes it is important to disclose MFFO in order to be consistent with the IPA recommendation and other non-traded REITs. MFFO adjustments for items such as acquisition fees would only be comparable to non-traded REITs that have completed the majority of their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics as us. Neither the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, nor any other regulatory body has approved the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC or another regulatory body may decide to standardize permitted adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we may need to adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nMFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure. Although management uses the MFFO metric to evaluate future operating performance, this metric excludes certain key operating items and other adjustments that may affect our overall operating performance. MFFO is not equivalent to net income (loss) as determined under U.S. GAAP. In addition, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value, since impairment is taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA, and adjust for certain items, such as accretion of a discount and amortization of a premium on borrowings and related deferred financing costs, as such adjustments are comparable to adjustments for debt investments and will be helpful in assessing our operating performance. Similarly, we adjust for the non-cash effect of unrealized gains or losses on unconsolidated ventures. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the same method MFFO is calculated using FFO. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance. The IPA's definition of MFFO excludes from FFO the following items:\n\u2022acquisition fees and expenses;\n\u2022non-cash amounts related to straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market and in-place intangible lease assets and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from an accrual basis of accounting under U.S. GAAP to a cash basis of accounting);\n\u2022amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt investments;\n\u2022non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments that meet the specified criteria identified in the rules and regulations of the SEC;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our business;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting;\n\u2022adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and\n\u2022adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above.\nCertain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves/impairment on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. With respect to debt investments, we consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors,\nincluding but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. Fair value is typically estimated based on discounting expected future cash flow of the underlying collateral taking into consideration the discount rate, capitalization rate, occupancy, creditworthiness of major tenants and many other factors. This requires significant judgment and because it is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the consolidated balance sheets date. If the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for the debt investment is less than its net carrying value, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. With respect to a real estate investment, a property's value is considered impaired if a triggering event is identified and our estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. The value of our investments may be impaired and their carrying values may not be recoverable due to our limited life. Investors should note that while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flow and the relatively limited term of a non-traded REIT's anticipated operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flow prior to any liquidity event.\nWe believe that MFFO is a useful non-GAAP measure for non-traded REITs. It is helpful to management and stockholders in assessing our future operating performance once our organization and offering, and acquisition and development stages are complete. However, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-traded REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-traded REITs, including if we were to extend our acquisition and development stage or if we determined not to pursue an exit strategy.\nHowever, MFFO does have certain limitations. For instance, the effect of any amortization or accretion on debt investments originated or acquired at a premium or discount, respectively, is not reported in MFFO. In addition, realized gains (losses) from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains (losses) and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions.\nNeither FFO nor MFFO is equivalent to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the U.S. GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance. Neither FFO nor MFFO is necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Furthermore, neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income

expenses.\nAs of March 17, 2022, we had approximately $191.1 million of unrestricted cash and currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. Liquidity has improved during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of proceeds received from both consolidated and unconsolidated investment portfolio sales and the full collection of the principal outstanding on our Espresso mezzanine loan debt investment.\nWhile we have the ability to meet our near-term liquidity needs, an extended recovery period from the effects of COVID-19 increases the risk of a prolonged negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity in February 2019. Our board of directors continues to evaluate our distribution policy on a recurring basis, and more frequently as facts and circumstances warrant. While we do not anticipate recurring dividends in the near future, in light of the cash flow generated by our investments as compared to our capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations, our board will evaluate special distributions in connection with asset sales and other realization of our investments on a case-by-case basis based on, among other factors, current and projected liquidity needs, opportunities for investment in our assets (such as capital expenditure and de-levering opportunities) and other strategic initiatives.\nFor additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties and rental income from our net lease properties, in addition to receiving distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, debt service payments on our borrowings exceeded our cash flow from operations. We have utilized proceeds from asset sales and repayments on our mezzanine loan to fund debt service payments, which is expected to continue until occupancy and revenues of our direct investments improve from current levels.\nA substantial majority of our direct investments are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. While our direct operating investments have not experienced any significant issues collecting rents or other fees from residents as a result of COVID-19, cash flow has continued to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes. We expect that these factors will continue to materially impact our revenues, expenses and cash flow generated by the communities of our direct operating investments.\nFor our net lease investment, the operator of our Arbors portfolio has been impacted by the same COVID-19 factors discussed above, which has and will continue to affect its ability and willingness to pay rent. As of March 17, 2022, the operator has satisfied its contractual rent obligations through May 2021 and continues to make partial rental payments based on availability of cash and liquidity. The operator has applied for and benefited from federal relief assistance, however, the operator's ability to pay rent in the future is currently unknown. Numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have also affected or may affect the landlord and its ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2021, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 40.3% and 12.3%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost. Our unconsolidated joint ventures, which have been similarly impacted by COVID-19 as our direct investments, are likely to continue to limit distributions to preserve liquidity.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy to leverage our investments while managing refinancing and interest rate risk. We typically finance our investments with medium to long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans, though our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. In addition, our Sponsor has made available a revolving line of credit to provide additional short-term liquidity as needed.\nWe are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had $943.8 million of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding and paid $92.8 million in recurring principal and interest payments on borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nDuring the year, the operator for the Arbors portfolio failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other conditions under its leases, which resulted in a defaults under the operator's leases, and in turn, resulted in a non-monetary default under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties as of December 31, 2021. We have remitted contractual debt service and are in compliance with the other contractual terms under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties.\nAs the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence our investments' performance, we may experience defaults in the future and it may have a negative impact on our ability to service or refinance our borrowings.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, our leverage was 53.6% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 59.5%.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net lease properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, functional and operating standards, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets. However, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will achieve these intended results.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nRealization and Disposition of Investments\nWe will actively pursue dispositions of assets and portfolios where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return, improve our liquidity position and generate value for shareholders. We have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties. We may share decision-making authority for these joint ventures that could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture. Further, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence the property's performance, it may have a negative impact on our ability to generate desired returns on dispositions.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Refer to -Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe adopted a share repurchase program, or the Share Repurchase Program, effective August 7, 2012, which enabled stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we only repurchased shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. On April 7, 2020, our board of directors suspended all repurchases under our existing Share Repurchase Program effective April 30, 2020 in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. In June 2021, our advisory agreement was amended and renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021. In connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,438) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37,456) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>661,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,415) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,128) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(538,020) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56,699) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(550,167) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,688) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,438 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $31.0 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in cash flow from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022declines in average occupancy, which resulted in lower rent and resident fees collected;\n\u2022less contractual rent collected from direct net lease investment operators; and\n\u2022higher payments for property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and mortgage payable interest, as a result of debt service that was deferred during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are primarily proceeds from investment dispositions, net of any capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities was $661.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $8.4 million net cash used for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were from property sales and principal repayments on our real estate debt investment. Cash inflows were used to fund recurring capital expenditures for existing investments and for general operations. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,559 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecurring capital expenditures have increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the resumption of normalized business operations allowing our operators to complete deferred capital improvements.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily the repayment of mortgage notes payable collateralized by properties sold during the year, the repayment of the borrowings under the Sponsor Line and continued principal amortization on our mortgage notes. Cash outflows were partially offset by the refinancing of a mortgage note payable for a property within our Aqua portfolio, which generated $6.5 million in net proceeds. Cash flows used in financing activities was $538.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $12.1 million cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily the $35.0 million borrowed under the Sponsor Line, partially offset by principal amortization payments on mortgage notes and repurchases of shares under our Share Repurchase Program.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022collection of a regulatory reserve deposit for a healthcare facility;\n\u2022lower interest expense, due to lower debt principal balances and effective interest rates;\n\u2022lower cash interest payments due to deferred debt service under executed debt forbearance agreements; and\n\u2022lower asset management fees paid in cash.\nCash flow improvements were partially offset by lower rent and resident fee income as well as higher operating expenses as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments, partially offset by distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of an equity contribution to our unconsolidated investment in the Diversified US/UK joint venture, partially offset by the net proceeds generated from the sale of two net lease properties and distributions received from unconsolidated investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands): Table 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,109) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecurring capital expenditures have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of limiting expenditures in response to COVID-19.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows from financing activities were principally impacted by borrowing $35.0 million under our Sponsor Line, partially offset by repurchases of common stock and repayments on our mortgage notes. Cash flows provided by financing activities was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and the repayment of a mortgage note payable upon the sale of two net lease properties were the primary drivers of financing cash flows.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 - 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 - 2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>2027 and Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and notes other payables(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>943,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>718,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,037 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>136,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advisor asset management fee(3)\n</td> <td>67,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(4)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,148,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>766,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,341 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1)Represents amortization of principal and repayment upon contractual initial maturity date.\n(2)Estimated interest payments are based on the remaining life of the borrowings.

As a result, the amount included in the table above is an estimate only and assumes the current net asset value and the continuation of our advisory agreement on its current terms. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our Advisor asset management fee.\n(4)Excludes construction related and other commitments for future development.\nBorrowings that are maturing in our unconsolidated ventures may require us to fund additional contributions if favorable refinancing is not obtained. We are not obligated to fund capital contributions, however our investment in the unconsolidated investment may be diluted and we may be prohibited from participating in future cash flows if we are unable to fund. In addition, our joint venture partners may be entitled to call additional capital under the governing documents of our joint ventures and certain of our operators and managers may require us to fund capital projects under our leases or management agreements. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences for any such failure to fund.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nDistributions Declared and Paid\nWe generally paid distributions on a monthly basis based on daily record dates on the first business day of the month following the month for which the distribution was accrued. From the date of our first investment on April 5, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we paid an annualized distribution amount of $0.675 per share of our common stock. Our board of directors approved a daily cash distribution of $0.000924658 per share of common stock, equivalent to an annualized distribution amount of $0.3375 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and month ended January 31, 2019. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors suspended distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nSince inception of our first investment, we declared $433.8 million in distributions and generated cumulative FFO of $131.9 million. We did not declare any distributions during the year ended December 31, 2021 or year ended December 31, 2020.\nTo the extent distributions are paid from sources other than FFO, the ownership interest of our public stockholders will be diluted. Future distributions declared and paid may exceed FFO and cash flow provided by operations. FFO, as defined, may not reflect actual cash available for distributions. Our ability to pay distributions from FFO or cash flow provided by operations depends upon our operating performance, including the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment, the type and mix of our investments, accounting of our investments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the performance of underlying debt and ability to maintain liquidity. We will continue to assess our distribution policy in light of our operating performance and capital needs.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nAdvisor\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, acquiring, originating and asset managing investments on our behalf. Our Advisor may delegate certain of its\nobligations to affiliated entities, which may be organized under the laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions. References to our Advisor include our Advisor and any such affiliated entities. For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, our Advisor receives fees and reimbursements from us. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our Advisor may defer or waive fees in its discretion. Below is a description and table of the fees and reimbursements incurred to our Advisor.\nIn June 2021, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021, with terms identical to those in effect through June 30, 2021, but for the following modifications:\n\u2022the payment of the asset management fee entirely in the form of our shares of common stock; and\n\u2022effective January 1, 2022, a reduction of the asset management fee with respect to our corporate cash balance exceeding $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022, upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but for certain updates to remove our Former Sponsor and add NRF as our New Sponsor for certain limited provisions.\nFees to Advisor\nAsset Management Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value, as may be subsequently adjusted for any special distribution declared by our board of directors in connection with a sale, transfer or other disposition of a substantial portion of our assets. Effective July 1, 2021, the asset management fee is paid entirely in shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the most recently published net asset value per share, and effective January 1, 2022, the fee will be reduced if our corporate cash balances exceed $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIncentive Fee\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive distributions equal to 15.0% of our net cash flows, whether from continuing operations, repayment of loans, disposition of assets or otherwise, but only after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus a 6.75% cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital. From inception through December 31, 2021, our Advisor has not received any incentive fees.\nAcquisition Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisitions of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDisposition Fee\nEffective June 30, 2020, our Advisor no longer has the potential to receive a disposition fee in connection with the sale of real estate properties or debt investments.\nReimbursements to Advisor\nOperating Costs\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs incurred by our Advisor in connection with administrative services provided to us. Our Advisor allocates, in good faith, indirect costs to us related to our Advisor's and its affiliates' employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the advisory agreement with our Advisor. The indirect costs include our allocable share of our Advisor's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The indirect costs also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies and other general and administrative costs and expenses. However, there is no reimbursement for personnel costs related to our executive officers (although there may be reimbursement for certain executive officers of our Advisor) and other personnel involved in activities for which our Advisor receives an acquisition fee or a disposition fee. Our Advisor allocates these costs to us relative to its and its affiliates' other managed companies in good faith and has reviewed the allocation with our board of directors, including our independent directors. Our Advisor updates our board of directors on a quarterly basis of any material changes to the expense allocation and provides a detailed review to the board of directors, at least annually, and as otherwise requested by the board of directors. We reimburse our Advisor quarterly for operating costs (including the asset management fee) based on a calculation, or the 2%/25% Guidelines, for the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of our average invested assets; or (ii)\n25.0% of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. Notwithstanding the above, we may reimburse our Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. We calculate the expense reimbursement quarterly based upon the trailing twelve-month period.\nSummary of Fees and Reimbursements\nThe following table presents the fees and reimbursements incurred and paid to our Advisor (dollars in thousands):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Fee or Reimbursement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Due to Related Party as of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Due to Related Party as of December 31, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Financial Statement Location </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Incurred </td> <td> </td> <td>Paid </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to Advisor Entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Asset management(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Asset management fees-related party </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,091) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements to Advisor Entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating costs(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>7,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,029) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Includes $10.6 million paid in shares of our common stock.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, our Advisor did not have any unreimbursed operating costs which remained eligible to be allocated to us.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses included in the 2%/25% Guidelines represented 0.4% of average invested assets and 58.9% of net loss without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves. Cost of capital is included in net proceeds from issuance of common stock in our consolidated statements of equity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not incur any offering costs.\nPursuant to our advisory agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 2.7 million shares totaling $10.6 million based on the estimated value per share on the date of each issuance, to an affiliate of our Advisor as part of its asset management fee. As of December 31, 2021, our Advisor, our Sponsor and their affiliates owned a total of 7.4 million shares, or $29.0 million of our common stock based on our most recent estimated value per share. As of December 31, 2021, our Advisor, our Sponsor and their affiliates owned 3.8% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nSolstice, the manager of the Winterfell portfolio, is a joint venture between affiliates of ISL, who owns 80.0%, and us, who owns 20.0%.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one mezzanine loan, which was repaid in August 2021.\nFor information regarding our investments as of December 31, 2021, refer to Our Investments\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Update\nInvestments, Financings and Disposition Activities\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 marked a pivotal and transitional period for our business, portfolio composition and liquidity. The following is a summary of significant investment, financing and disposition activities during the year:\n\u2022In December 2021, we completed the sale of the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios for $580.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $114.0 million after the repayment of mortgage notes, which totaled $450.7 million and payment of transaction and other costs, distributions to non-controlling interests, and releases of reserves and other prorations.\n\u2022In August 2021, the outstanding principal balance of our mezzanine loan was repaid in full. Principal repayments received during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $74.4 million, which includes payment-in-kind interest. The borrower funded these principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\n\u2022In July 2021, we repaid, in full, the $35.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit from an affiliate of our Sponsor, or the Sponsor Line.\n\u2022In June 2021, we completed the sale of the Kansas City portfolio, which generated net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million.\n\u2022In May 2021, we completed the sale of the Smyrna net lease property, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million.\n\u2022In April 2021, we extended the maturity date of a mortgage note payable for a property within the Rochester portfolio to August 2022 and made a $1.0 million principal repayment.\n\u2022In March 2021, we completed the sale of a property within the Aqua portfolio for $22.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $0.9 million, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage principal balance of $20.1 million and transaction costs.\n\u2022In January 2021, we refinanced an existing $18.7 million note payable, collateralized by a property within the Aqua portfolio, with a $26.0 million mortgage note payable. The new mortgage note carries a fixed interest rate of 3.0% through February 2024 and has an initial maturity date of February 2026.\nOperating Performance\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. Significant vaccine deployment helped to reduce COVID-19 infections and transmissions within our communities, which in turn, improved demand, led to an improvement in resident occupancy at our communities during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and reduced preventative operating costs.\nWe continue to see increased demand and lead generation for our communities and remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for the seniors housing industry, but anticipate the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operational and financial performance of our business, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time. New variants of the virus, which may increase reported infection rates, along with labor and inflationary pressures on costs, may further interfere with the general economic recovery.\nAt this time, the progression of the global economic recovery from the broad effects of the pandemic is difficult to assess and estimate the future impact on our results of operations. Accordingly, any estimates of the effects of COVID-19 as reflected or discussed are based upon our best estimates using information known to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such estimates may change in the future, the effects of which could be material.\nThe following is a summary of the performance of our investment segments for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For additional information on financial results, refer to -Results of Operations.\u201d\nDirect Investments - Operating\nThe impact of COVID-19 resulted in occupancy levels nearing historical lows across our direct operating investments at the beginning of 2021. While average occupancy was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, on a same store basis, our direct operating investments experienced an improved demand and an increase in the number of resident move-ins during 2021. Recent occupancy trends have shown improvements, with average monthly occupancy in December 2021 exceeding the average monthly occupancy in December 2020 by 2.5%. A summary of average occupancy by manager is as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Monthly Occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Annual Occupancy </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operator / Manager </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watermark Retirement Communities(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>77.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Solstice Senior Living </td> <td> </td> <td>77.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>76.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Avamere Health Services </td> <td> </td> <td>85.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integral Senior Living(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>88.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct Investments - Operating </td> <td> </td> <td>77.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>75.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>77.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Average monthly and annual occupancy excludes properties sold.\nOn a same store basis, rental and resident fee income of our direct operating investments declined to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $163.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, average annual occupancy for our direct operating investments declined by 2.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020. However, declines in revenue from lower occupancy were partially offset by rate increases. While occupancy improved during the second half of 2021, our direct operating investments' occupancy levels remain below pre-pandemic averages.\nOn a same store basis, excluding COVID-19 related expenses, property operating expenses of our direct operating investments increased to $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to experience staffing challenges and, in turn, salaries and wages expense has increased due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, sales and marketing expenses have increased with the improved volume of resident move-ins, while the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our managers to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nOverall, on a same store basis, rental and resident fee income, net of property operating expenses, of our direct operating investments decreased to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur direct operating investments incurred COVID-19 related expenses totaling $4.4 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our direct operating investments received and recognized grant income totaling $7.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, from the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. These grants are intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nDirect Investments - Net Lease\nOn a same store basis, we recognized $3.4 million of rental income from our direct net lease investments during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $10.1 million recognized in 2020, excluding straight-line rental adjustments in both periods. A summary of rental income from our direct net lease investments is as follows:\n\u2022The operator of our Arbors portfolio has failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other lease conditions. Contractual monthly rent obligations have been remitted through April 2021 and we have recorded rental income to the extent rental payments were received during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022We sold our Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio in December 2021. The operator remitted full contractual rent per the amended terms of its lease through November 2021. In April 2021, we executed a lease modification that allowed the operator to defer up to $3.0 million of contractual rent payments over the remaining term of the lease, which were forgiven upon the sale of the portfolio.\n\u2022We sold our Smyrna property in May 2021. No rental income was received or recognized from the operator during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnconsolidated Investments\nOverall, our unconsolidated investment portfolios experienced similar operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic as our direct operating investments. Equity in earnings totaled $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to equity in losses of $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Equity in earnings includes our proportionate share of net gains from sales transactions in the Espresso and Eclipse joint ventures, which totaled $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These sales resulted in lower rental income recognized by the joint ventures during the year ended December 31, 2021. Equity in losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes our proportionate share of impairment losses recorded by the underlying joint ventures of our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $38.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we received distributions from our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $18.1 million as compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in distributions is primarily a result of increased sales activity during the year ended December 31, 2021. Distributions continued to be limited by reinvestment and development in the Trilogy joint venture, operational challenges in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures and debt repayments in the Espresso joint venture.\nThe following is a summary of operations and performance for the Trilogy, Diversified US/UK, and Espresso joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\u2022Trilogy: Labor shortages, resulting in additional overtime and agency staffing, continued to impact the operations of the predominantly SNF portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, less federal COVID-19 provider relief grants were received and recognized as income during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. While challenged throughout 2021, occupancy and financial results improved during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022Espresso: The joint venture received full contractual rent from its net lease operators during the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, the joint venture resumed distributions to its partners for the first time since the second quarter of 2017. During 2021, the portfolio sold 43 properties, or 28% of the portfolio. Net proceeds from the sales were used to repay our mezzanine loan originated to the joint venture. Refer to -Business Update\u201d for further detail on the mezzanine loan repayment.\n\u2022Diversified US/UK: The joint venture received substantially all contractual monthly rent from its net lease and MOB tenants in the United States during the year ended December 31, 2021. SNF and ALF operating portfolios sustained suboptimal occupancy levels and experienced staffing challenges resulting from the continued broad effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The operator of the joint venture's net lease portfolio in the United Kingdom experienced similar effects of the pandemic on its operations, which resulted in a lease modification and lower rental income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $4.7 million, a decrease from $7.7 million for the ended year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the loan being repaid in full in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a discussion of material events which have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2021 through March 17, 2022.\nSponsor Transaction\nOn February 28, 2022, our former Sponsor, DigitalBridge Group, Inc., or our Former Sponsor, completed the previously announced disposition of its wellness infrastructure platform, or the Sponsor Transaction, which included CNI NSHC Advisors, LLC, or our Advisor, and the individuals currently engaged in the management and oversight of the healthcare platform. The sale resulted in a change of the owner and control of our Advisor to NRF Holdco, LLC, or NRF or our New Sponsor, but did not directly impact the ownership or control of us or any of our assets.\nAdvisory Agreement\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for a one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022 upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but removed our Former Sponsor as the Sponsor and added NRF as the New Sponsor.\nSponsor Line of Credit\nOn February 28, 2022, our Sponsor Line was amended to extend the maturity date to February 28, 2024.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe healthcare industry, which includes ILFs, ALFs, MCFs, CCRCs, SNFs, MOBs and hospitals, continues to experience the effects of COVID-19, including declines in resident occupancy, lower operating cash flows and compressed operating margins.\nThe CARES Act has provided over $100 billion in grants to eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Licensed assisted living providers became eligible to apply for funding under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 2 General Distribution allocation and remain eligible under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 3 and Phase 4 General Distributions. In addition, the CMS has provided accelerated and advance payments to Medicare providers. Operators continue to evaluate their options for financial assistance, such as utilizing programs within the CARES Act as well as other state and local government relief programs. However, the uncertainty regarding future availability of such relief, and its ultimate impact, including the extent to which relief funds from such programs will provide meaningful support for lost revenue and increasing costs, is uncertain. Additionally, although we continue to evaluate and monitor the terms and conditions associated with relief programs, we cannot ensure ultimate compliance with all the requirements related to the assistance received. If any of our operators fail to comply with all of the terms and conditions, they may be required to repay some or all of the grants received and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nHealthcare industry operating results will continue to be impacted to the extent occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels. Further, the healthcare industry anticipates operating margins will continue to be impacted by cost inflation, labor pressures, additional staffing needs and related cost burdens.\nThe healthcare industry's operational and financial recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 will depend on a variety of factors, which may differ considerably across regions, fluctuate over time and are highly uncertain. The healthcare industry experienced a higher pace of move-ins during the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the third quarter of 2021. As a result of overall increase in resident demand, improving consumer sentiment and easing restrictions on visitation and admissions, the seniors housing industry occupancy average rose to 81.0% during the fourth quarter of 2021 from 80.1% in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, annual inventory growth decreased to 2.4% during the fourth quarter of 2021, while construction versus inventory ratio of 5.2% remained elevated in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: The National Investment Centers for Seniors Housing & Care, or NIC).\nSeniors Housing\nNotwithstanding the demographics and forecasted spending growth, economic and healthcare market uncertainty, development, and competitive pressures have had a negative impact on the seniors housing industry, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing operating income for managers and operators.\nSupply growth, which has outpaced demand, has challenged the seniors housing industry over the past several years. New inventory, coupled with the average move-in age of seniors housing residents increasing over time, has resulted in declining occupancy for the industry on average. Further, to remain competitive with the new supply, owners and operators of older facilities have increased capital expenditure spending, which in turn has negatively affected cash flow. While off its peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory was 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: NIC). It is expected that, as demographics and demand continues to increase long-term, supply growth will follow.\nAs a result of increased supply, the seniors housing industry has experienced competitive pressures that have limited rent growth over the past several years. Average market rent growth reached its peak of 4.2% in 2016 and has since decreased to 2.3% as of the fourth quarter of 2021, with pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the decline (source: NIC). Limited future supply growth and reestablishing normal operations in a post-pandemic environment will be factors in achieving near and long term revenue growth for the industry.\nFurther, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff had resulted in increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated operating expense growth, with increased staffing needs and personal protective equipment requirements. While it is expected that the increases in expenses to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be temporary, wage and benefits increases may continue to impact the industry's margins in the future, as labor represents 60% of the seniors housing industry's operating expenses (source: Green Street).\nSkilled Nursing\nWhile generally impacted by the same conditions as the seniors housing industry, SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges. Increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with inspections, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims have contributed to compressed margins and declines in cash flow.\nSNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancy and declining operating margins, liquidity and financial conditions.\nOn February 28, 2022, the White House announced a set of reforms, developed by and implemented through HHS, aimed at improving safety and quality of nursing home care. The new initiatives include establishing a minimum nursing home staffing requirement, reducing resident room crowding and reinforcing safeguards against unnecessary medications and treatments. To ensure compliance, in addition to increased government inspections, the White House Administration plans to expand the financial penalties and other enforcement sanctions against facilities not meeting the set standards. These reforms might further increase the cost burdens for our SNF operators and expose them to financial penalties.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time.\nFor a summary of our accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe highlight below accounting estimates that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations and/or require significant management judgment and assumptions:\n\u2022Impairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. Fair values can be estimated based upon the income capitalization approach, using net operating income for each property and applying indicative capitalization and discount rates or sales comparison approach, using what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as price for comparable properties.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment losses totaling $5.4 million on our operating real estate, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio, as a result of lower estimated future cash flows and market value, and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated impairment losses of $145.1 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2021. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not impair any of our investments in unconsolidated ventures. The Eclipse joint venture recorded impairment losses, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.8 million.\nDue to uncertainties over the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, it is difficult to assess and estimate the further economic effects of COVID-19 with any meaningful precision. As the future impact of COVID-19 will depend on many factors beyond our control and knowledge, the resulting effect on impairment of our operating real estate and investments in unconsolidated ventures may materially differ from our current expectations and further impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nResults of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. We continue to monitor the progression of the economic recovery from COVID-19 and its effects on our results of operations and assess recoverability of value across our assets as conditions change.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property and other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Resident fee income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,171) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income </td> <td> </td> <td>137,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,702) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(198) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total property and other revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>243,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,071) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on debt investments </td> <td> </td> <td>4,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,007) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>177,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>61,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset management fees -

Limited move-ins and elevated move-outs throughout the first half of 2021 resulted in lower average occupancy and rental income recognized by our ILFs. Additionally, the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio was sold in December 2021 and recognized lower contractual rent in 2021 under the amended terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is primarily interest earned on uninvested cash, which has been impacted by declining market interest rates.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment decreased as a result of receiving the full repayment of outstanding principal in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold and COVID-19 related expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>89,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>2,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,197) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>55,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,377) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,242) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, total operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily as a result of property sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Watermark Fountains portfolio sold in December 2021, the Kansas City portfolio in June 2021 and a property within the Aqua portfolio sold in March 2021. Additionally, COVID-19 related expenses were lower during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.\nExcluding properties sold and COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses increased $9.3 million, primarily as a result of our operators experiencing staffing challenges, which has increased salaries and wages due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our operators to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>33,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,151) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>3,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>18,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,788) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(208) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased $4.4 million primarily as a result of the repayment of mortgage notes payable which were collateralized by properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, average mortgage notes principal balances decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to continued principal amortization, while lower LIBOR has reduced interest expense on our floating-rate debt. Corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line, which was repaid in full in July 2021.\nAsset Management Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management fees - related party decreased $6.1 million as a result of the estimated net asset value effective December 2020 decreasing from the previous estimated net asset value effective December 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.8 million primarily as a result of amortizing our directors' and officers' insurance premium incurred and reimbursed to our Advisor over the term of the policy, beginning in December 2021. The policy premium was expensed as incurred by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we incurred non-operating costs at a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(448) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>29,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(861) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>3,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>15,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,861) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,170) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily as a result of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced building depreciation expense in 2021.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, impairment losses on operating real estate totaled $5.4 million, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses totaling $166.0 million were recorded, consisting of $84.9 million recognized for nine facilities within our Winterfell portfolio, $4.2 million for a facility within the Avamere portfolio, $12.5 million for two facilities within the Rochester portfolio and $64.4 million for properties that were sold in 2021.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $7.7 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS, partially offset by a $0.5 million non-operating loss recognized at a property within the Watermark Fountains portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS were received and recognized.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nReal estate property sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in net realized gains, which totaled $84.0 million and were partially offset by debt extinguishment losses, which totaled $8.7 million. In addition, we recognized gains on distributions that exceeded our carrying value for our investments in the Espresso and Envoy joint ventures, which totaled $4.4 million.\nDuring the year ended

The concession allowed the operator to defer a portion of contractual rent payments for a 90-day period, with full contractual rent repaid over the 12 months following the concession period. The amount of the deferred rental payments under the lease concession totaled $3.9 million. As there were no substantive changes to the original lease or changes in total cash flows, the concession was not treated as a lease modification and we continued to recognize lease income and receivables under the original terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased primarily as a result of non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio during 2019, as well as lower interest earned on uninvested cash during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income generated by our one mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $7.7 million, which was comparable to interest income recognized during year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes COVID-19 related expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,616) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>83,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,354) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>9,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Property operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, operating expenses increased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

These expenses include personal protective equipment for residents and staff as well as wages for increased staffing and paying a premium for labor in many markets, particularly in communities that were severely impacted by COVID-19.\nExcluding COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses decreased $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower census in our direct investment operating portfolio resulted in lower utilities and food and beverage costs. Additionally, repairs and maintenance expense was lower year over year, as operators minimized all non-essential projects across our direct investment operating portfolio in response to COVID-19.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,561) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,589) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>11,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(355) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>830.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,905) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of lower average mortgage notes principal balances due to continued principal amortization and loan payoffs. In addition, lower LIBOR reduced interest expense\non our floating rate debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management and other fees - related party decreased $2.6 million as a result of the declining estimated net asset value year over year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of significant increases to insurance premiums. Further, we incurred non-operating compensation costs for a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store (excludes properties sold) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALF/MCF/CCRC properties </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ILF properties </td> <td> </td> <td>30,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,560) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net lease properties </td> <td> </td> <td>14,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties sold </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,983) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 million, primarily as a result of intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the Winterfell and Rochester portfolios in 2019. In addition, impairment losses recognized reduced depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $166.0 million for properties with sustained poor performance, declines in occupancy and operating margins, and which have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $27.6 million. Impairment was recognized for two ALFs with sustained low occupancy within the Rochester portfolio, two poor performing properties within the Kansas City portfolio and a net lease property classified as held for sale.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS. These grants were intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 by our direct operating investments. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $0.3 million gain on the settlement of the share-based payment to our Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains totaled $6.3 million and were primarily related to the sale of two net lease properties and two condominiums units for which we held future interests in the Watermark Fountains portfolio.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures\nThe following table presents the results of our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in

excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion.\nOur proportionate share of losses generated by our unconsolidated ventures increased $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to real estate impairments recorded by the Diversified US/UK, Eclipse and Trilogy joint ventures.\nEquity in earnings, after FFO and MFFO adjustments, increased by $3.5 million. Improved performance in the Espresso joint venture, primarily due to full contractual rent collections and lower interest and operating expenses, as well as federal COVID-19 provider relief funds received and recognized by the Trilogy joint venture, were the main contributors to the increase. Non-recurring earnings recognized by the Envoy joint venture upon the completion of the sale of its remaining operating assets in 2019 and declines in operational performance in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures, as a result of the effects of COVID-19, partially offset the increase.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe believe that Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and of us in particular. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable property, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under U.S. GAAP that have been put into effect since the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in the non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO. For instance, the accounting treatment for acquisition fees related to business combinations has changed from being capitalized to being expensed. Additionally, publicly registered, non-traded REITs are typically different from traded REITs because they generally have a limited life followed by a liquidity event or other targeted exit strategy. Non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation as compared to later years when the proceeds from their initial public offering have been fully invested and when they may seek to implement a liquidity event or other exit strategy. However, it is likely that we will make investments past the acquisition and development stage, albeit at a substantially lower pace.\nAcquisition fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the origination and acquisition of debt investments have been amortized over the life of the investment as an adjustment to interest income, while fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of equity investments were generally expensed under U.S. GAAP. In both situations, the fees were included in the computation of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense), both of which are performance measures under U.S. GAAP. We adjusted MFFO for the amortization of acquisition fees in the period when such amortization was recognized under U.S. GAAP or in the period in which the acquisition fees were expensed. Acquisition fees were paid in cash that would otherwise have been available to distribute to our\nstockholders. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties. However, in general, we earned origination fees for debt investments from our borrowers in an amount equal to the acquisition fees paid to our Advisor. Effective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisition of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDue to certain of the unique features of publicly-registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA, an industry trade group, standardized a performance measure known as MFFO and recommends the use of MFFO for such REITs. Management believes MFFO is a useful performance measure to evaluate our business and further believes it is important to disclose MFFO in order to be consistent with the IPA recommendation and other non-traded REITs. MFFO adjustments for items such as acquisition fees would only be comparable to non-traded REITs that have completed the majority of their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics as us. Neither the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, nor any other regulatory body has approved the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC or another regulatory body may decide to standardize permitted adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we may need to adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nMFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure. Although management uses the MFFO metric to evaluate future operating performance, this metric excludes certain key operating items and other adjustments that may affect our overall operating performance. MFFO is not equivalent to net income (loss) as determined under U.S. GAAP. In addition, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value, since impairment is taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA, and adjust for certain items, such as accretion of a discount and amortization of a premium on borrowings and related deferred financing costs, as such adjustments are comparable to adjustments for debt investments and will be helpful in assessing our operating performance. Similarly, we adjust for the non-cash effect of unrealized gains or losses on unconsolidated ventures. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the same method MFFO is calculated using FFO. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance. The IPA's definition of MFFO excludes from FFO the following items:\n\u2022acquisition fees and expenses;\n\u2022non-cash amounts related to straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market and in-place intangible lease assets and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from an accrual basis of accounting under U.S. GAAP to a cash basis of accounting);\n\u2022amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt investments;\n\u2022non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments that meet the specified criteria identified in the rules and regulations of the SEC;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our business;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting;\n\u2022adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and\n\u2022adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above.\nCertain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves/impairment on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. With respect to debt investments, we consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors,\nincluding but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. Fair value is typically estimated based on discounting expected future cash flow of the underlying collateral taking into consideration the discount rate, capitalization rate, occupancy, creditworthiness of major tenants and many other factors. This requires significant judgment and because it is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the consolidated balance sheets date. If the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for the debt investment is less than its net carrying value, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. With respect to a real estate investment, a property's value is considered impaired if a triggering event is identified and our estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. The value of our investments may be impaired and their carrying values may not be recoverable due to our limited life. Investors should note that while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flow and the relatively limited term of a non-traded REIT's anticipated operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flow prior to any liquidity event.\nWe believe that MFFO is a useful non-GAAP measure for non-traded REITs. It is helpful to management and stockholders in assessing our future operating performance once our organization and offering, and acquisition and development stages are complete. However, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-traded REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-traded REITs, including if we were to extend our acquisition and development stage or if we determined not to pursue an exit strategy.\nHowever, MFFO does have certain limitations. For instance, the effect of any amortization or accretion on debt investments originated or acquired at a premium or discount, respectively, is not reported in MFFO. In addition, realized gains (losses) from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains (losses) and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions.\nNeither FFO nor MFFO is equivalent to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the U.S. GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance. Neither FFO nor MFFO is necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Furthermore, neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income

above/below market debt adjustments, straight-line rent adjustments, debt extinguishment losses and deferred financing costs, incurred through our investments in unconsolidated ventures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) operating expenses; (ii) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; and (iii) capital expenditures, including capital calls in connection with our unconsolidated joint venture investments.\nOur current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) proceeds from full or partial realization of investments; (iii) cash flow generated by our investments, both from our operating activities and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures; and (iv) secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, including investment-level financing and/or a corporate credit facility.\nOur investments generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, resident fees and interest income, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments and capital expenditures and are used to pay corporate general and administrative expenses.\nAs of March 17, 2022, we had approximately $191.1 million of unrestricted cash and currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. Liquidity has improved during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of proceeds received from both consolidated and unconsolidated investment portfolio sales and the full collection of the principal outstanding on our Espresso mezzanine loan debt investment.\nWhile we have the ability to meet our near-term liquidity needs, an extended recovery period from the effects of COVID-19 increases the risk of a prolonged negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity in February 2019. Our board of directors continues to evaluate our distribution policy on a recurring basis, and more frequently as facts and circumstances warrant. While we do not anticipate recurring dividends in the near future, in light of the cash flow generated by our investments as compared to our capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations, our board will evaluate special distributions in connection with asset sales and other realization of our investments on a case-by-case basis based on, among other factors, current and projected liquidity needs, opportunities for investment in our assets (such as capital expenditure and de-levering opportunities) and other strategic initiatives.\nFor additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties and rental income from our net lease properties, in addition to receiving distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, debt service payments on our borrowings exceeded our cash flow from operations. We have utilized proceeds from asset sales and repayments on our mezzanine loan to fund debt service payments, which is expected to continue until occupancy and revenues of our direct investments improve from current levels.\nA substantial majority of our direct investments are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. While our direct operating investments have not experienced any significant issues collecting rents or other fees from residents as a result of COVID-19, cash flow has continued to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes. We expect that these factors will continue to materially impact our revenues, expenses and cash flow generated by the communities of our direct operating investments.\nFor our net lease investment, the operator of our Arbors portfolio has been impacted by the same COVID-19 factors discussed above, which has and will continue to affect its ability and willingness to pay rent. As of March 17, 2022, the operator has satisfied its contractual rent obligations through May 2021 and continues to make partial rental payments based on availability of cash and liquidity. The operator has applied for and benefited from federal relief assistance, however, the operator's ability to pay rent in the future is currently unknown. Numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have also affected or may affect the landlord and its ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2021, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 40.3% and 12.3%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost. Our unconsolidated joint ventures, which have been similarly impacted by COVID-19 as our direct investments, are likely to continue to limit distributions to preserve liquidity.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy to leverage our investments while managing refinancing and interest rate risk. We typically finance our investments with medium to long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans, though our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. In addition, our Sponsor has made available a revolving line of credit to provide additional short-term liquidity as needed.\nWe are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had $943.8 million of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding and paid $92.8 million in recurring principal and interest payments on borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nDuring the year, the operator for the Arbors portfolio failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other conditions under its leases, which resulted in a defaults under the operator's leases, and in turn, resulted in a non-monetary default under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties as of December 31, 2021. We have remitted contractual debt service and are in compliance with the other contractual terms under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties.\nAs the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence our investments' performance, we may experience defaults in the future and it may have a negative impact on our ability to service or refinance our borrowings.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, our leverage was 53.6% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 59.5%.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net lease properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, functional and operating standards, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets. However, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will achieve these intended results.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nRealization and Disposition of Investments\nWe will actively pursue dispositions of assets and portfolios where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return, improve our liquidity position and generate value for shareholders. We have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties. We may share decision-making authority for these joint ventures that could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture. Further, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence the property's performance, it may have a negative impact on our ability to generate desired returns on dispositions.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Refer to -Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe adopted a share repurchase program, or the Share Repurchase Program, effective August 7, 2012, which enabled stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we only repurchased shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. On April 7, 2020, our board of directors suspended all repurchases under our existing Share Repurchase Program effective April 30, 2020 in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. In June 2021, our advisory agreement was amended and renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021. In connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,438) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37,456) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,720 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>661,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,415) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,287) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,128) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(538,020) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56,699) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(550,167) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,846 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,688) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,438 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $31.0 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in cash flow from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022declines in average occupancy, which resulted in lower rent and resident fees collected;\n\u2022less contractual rent collected from direct net lease investment operators; and\n\u2022higher payments for property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and mortgage payable interest, as a result of debt service that was deferred during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are primarily proceeds from investment dispositions, net of any capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities was $661.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $8.4 million net cash used for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were from property sales and principal repayments on our real estate debt investment. Cash inflows were used to fund recurring capital expenditures for existing investments and for general operations. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,559 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecurring capital expenditures have increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the resumption of normalized business operations allowing our operators to complete deferred capital improvements.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily the repayment of mortgage notes payable collateralized by properties sold during the year, the repayment of the borrowings under the Sponsor Line and continued principal amortization on our mortgage notes. Cash outflows were partially offset by the refinancing of a mortgage note payable for a property within our Aqua portfolio, which generated $6.5 million in net proceeds. Cash flows used in financing activities was $538.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $12.1 million cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily the $35.0 million borrowed under the Sponsor Line, partially offset by principal amortization payments on mortgage notes and repurchases of shares under our Share Repurchase Program.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022collection of a regulatory reserve deposit for a healthcare facility;\n\u2022lower interest expense, due to lower debt principal balances and effective interest rates;\n\u2022lower cash interest payments due to deferred debt service under executed debt forbearance agreements; and\n\u2022lower asset management fees paid in cash.\nCash flow improvements were partially offset by lower rent and resident fee income as well as higher operating expenses as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments, partially offset by distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of an equity contribution to our unconsolidated investment in the Diversified US/UK joint venture, partially offset by the net proceeds generated from the sale of two net lease properties and distributions received from unconsolidated investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands): Table 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recurring </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,109) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecurring capital expenditures have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of limiting expenditures in response to COVID-19.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows from financing activities were principally impacted by borrowing $35.0 million under our Sponsor Line, partially offset by repurchases of common stock and repayments on our mortgage notes.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and the repayment of a mortgage note payable upon the sale of two net lease properties were the primary drivers of financing cash flows.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 - 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 - 2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>2027 and Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage and notes other payables(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>943,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>718,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,037 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest payments(2)\n</td> <td>136,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advisor asset management fee(3)\n</td> <td>67,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(4)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,148,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>766,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168,341 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1)Represents amortization of principal and repayment upon contractual initial maturity date.\n(2)Estimated interest payments are based on the remaining life of the borrowings.

As a result, the amount included in the table above is an estimate only and assumes the current net asset value and the continuation of our advisory agreement on its current terms. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our Advisor asset management fee.\n(4)Excludes construction related and other commitments for future development.\nBorrowings that are maturing in our unconsolidated ventures may require us to fund additional contributions if favorable refinancing is not obtained. We are not obligated to fund capital contributions, however our investment in the unconsolidated investment may be diluted and we may be prohibited from participating in future cash flows if we are unable to fund. In addition, our joint venture partners may be entitled to call additional capital under the governing documents of our joint ventures and certain of our operators and managers may require us to fund capital projects under our leases or management agreements. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences for any such failure to fund.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nDistributions Declared and Paid\nWe generally paid distributions on a monthly basis based on daily record dates on the first business day of the month following the month for which the distribution was accrued. From the date of our first investment on April 5, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we paid an annualized distribution amount of $0.675 per share of our common stock. Our board of directors approved a daily cash distribution of $0.000924658 per share of common stock, equivalent to an annualized distribution amount of $0.3375 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and month ended January 31, 2019. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors suspended distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nSince inception of our first investment, we declared $433.8 million in distributions and generated cumulative FFO of $131.9 million. We did not declare any distributions during the year ended December 31, 2021 or year ended December 31, 2020.\nTo the extent distributions are paid from sources other than FFO, the ownership interest of our public stockholders will be diluted. Future distributions declared and paid may exceed FFO and cash flow provided by operations. FFO, as defined, may not reflect actual cash available for distributions. Our ability to pay distributions from FFO or cash flow provided by operations depends upon our operating performance, including the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment, the type and mix of our investments, accounting of our investments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the performance of underlying debt and ability to maintain liquidity. We will continue to assess our distribution policy in light of our operating performance and capital needs.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nAdvisor\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, acquiring, originating and asset managing investments on our behalf. Our Advisor may delegate certain of its\nobligations to affiliated entities, which may be organized under the laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions. References to our Advisor include our Advisor and any such affiliated entities. For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, our Advisor receives fees and reimbursements from us. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our Advisor may defer or waive fees in its discretion. Below is a description and table of the fees and reimbursements incurred to our Advisor.\nIn June 2021, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021, with terms identical to those in effect through June 30, 2021, but for the following modifications:\n\u2022the payment of the asset management fee entirely in the form of our shares of common stock; and\n\u2022effective January 1, 2022, a reduction of the asset management fee with respect to our corporate cash balance exceeding $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022, upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but for certain updates to remove our Former Sponsor and add NRF as our New Sponsor for certain limited provisions.\nFees to Advisor\nAsset Management Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value, as may be subsequently adjusted for any special distribution declared by our board of directors in connection with a sale, transfer or other disposition of a substantial portion of our assets. Effective July 1, 2021, the asset management fee is paid entirely in shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the most recently published net asset value per share, and effective January 1, 2022, the fee will be reduced if our corporate cash balances exceed $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIncentive Fee\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive distributions equal to 15.0% of our net cash flows, whether from continuing operations, repayment of loans, disposition of assets or otherwise, but only after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus a 6.75% cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital. From inception through December 31, 2021, our Advisor has not received any incentive fees.\nAcquisition Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisitions of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDisposition Fee\nEffective June 30, 2020, our Advisor no longer has the potential to receive a disposition fee in connection with the sale of real estate properties or debt investments.\nReimbursements to Advisor\nOperating Costs\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs incurred by our Advisor in connection with administrative services provided to us. Our Advisor allocates, in good faith, indirect costs to us related to our Advisor's and its affiliates' employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the advisory agreement with our Advisor. The indirect costs include our allocable share of our Advisor's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The indirect costs also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies and other general and administrative costs and expenses. However, there is no reimbursement for personnel costs related to our executive officers (although there may be reimbursement for certain executive officers of our Advisor) and other personnel involved in activities for which our Advisor receives an acquisition fee or a disposition fee. Our Advisor allocates these costs to us relative to its and its affiliates' other managed companies in good faith and has reviewed the allocation with our board of directors, including our independent directors. Our Advisor updates our board of directors on a quarterly basis of any material changes to the expense allocation and provides a detailed review to the board of directors, at least annually, and as otherwise requested by the board of directors. We reimburse our Advisor quarterly for operating costs (including the asset management fee) based on a calculation, or the 2%/25% Guidelines, for the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of our average invested assets; or (ii)\n25.0% of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. Notwithstanding the above, we may reimburse our Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. We calculate the expense reimbursement quarterly based upon the trailing twelve-month period.\nSummary of Fees and Reimbursements\nThe following table presents the fees and reimbursements incurred and paid to our Advisor (dollars in thousands):\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Fee or Reimbursement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Due to Related Party as of December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Due to Related Party as of December 31, 2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Financial Statement Location </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Incurred </td> <td> </td> <td>Paid </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees to Advisor Entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Asset management(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Asset management fees-related party </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,091) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>937 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursements to Advisor Entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating costs(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>7,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,029) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________\n(1)Includes $10.6 million paid in shares of our common stock.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, our Advisor did not have any unreimbursed operating costs which remained eligible to be allocated to us.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not incur any offering costs.\nPursuant to our advisory agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 2.7 million shares totaling $10.6 million based on the estimated value per share on the date of each issuance, to an affiliate of our Advisor as part of its asset management fee.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements\u201d and the risk factors in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d References to we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or NorthStar Healthcare\u201d refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nBusiness Summary\nWe have invested in independent living facilities, or ILFs, assisted living facilities, or ALFs, memory care facilities, or MCFs, and continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, which we collectively refer to as seniors housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, medical office buildings, or MOBs, and hospitals.\nOur primary investment segments are as follows:\n\u2022Direct Investments - Operating - Healthcare properties operated pursuant to management agreements with healthcare managers.\n\u2022Direct Investments - Net Lease - Healthcare properties operated under net leases with an operator.\n\u2022Unconsolidated Investments - Healthcare joint ventures, including properties operated under net leases with an operator or pursuant to management agreements with healthcare managers, in which we own a minority interest.\n\u2022Debt Investments - Mortgage loans or mezzanine loans to owners of healthcare real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one mezzanine loan, which was repaid in August 2021.\nFor information regarding our investments as of December 31, 2021, refer to Our Investments\u201d included in Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Update\nInvestments, Financings and Disposition Activities\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 marked a pivotal and transitional period for our business, portfolio composition and liquidity. The following is a summary of significant investment, financing and disposition activities during the year:\n\u2022In December 2021, we completed the sale of the Watermark Fountains net lease and operating portfolios for $580.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $114.0 million after the repayment of mortgage notes, which totaled $450.7 million and payment of transaction and other costs, distributions to non-controlling interests, and releases of reserves and other prorations.\n\u2022In August 2021, the outstanding principal balance of our mezzanine loan was repaid in full. Principal repayments received during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $74.4 million, which includes payment-in-kind interest. The borrower funded these principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\n\u2022In July 2021, we repaid, in full, the $35.0 million outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit from an affiliate of our Sponsor, or the Sponsor Line.\n\u2022In June 2021, we completed the sale of the Kansas City portfolio, which generated net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million.\n\u2022In May 2021, we completed the sale of the Smyrna net lease property, which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.7 million.\n\u2022In April 2021, we extended the maturity date of a mortgage note payable for a property within the Rochester portfolio to August 2022 and made a $1.0 million principal repayment.\n\u2022In March 2021, we completed the sale of a property within the Aqua portfolio for $22.0 million. The sale generated net proceeds of $0.9 million, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage principal balance of $20.1 million and transaction costs.\n\u2022In January 2021, we refinanced an existing $18.7 million note payable, collateralized by a property within the Aqua portfolio, with a $26.0 million mortgage note payable. The new mortgage note carries a fixed interest rate of 3.0% through February 2024 and has an initial maturity date of February 2026.\nOperating Performance\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. Significant vaccine deployment helped to reduce COVID-19 infections and transmissions within our communities, which in turn, improved demand, led to an improvement in resident occupancy at our communities during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and reduced preventative operating costs.\nWe continue to see increased demand and lead generation for our communities and remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for the seniors housing industry, but anticipate the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operational and financial performance of our business, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time. New variants of the virus, which may increase reported infection rates, along with labor and inflationary pressures on costs, may further interfere with the general economic recovery.\nAt this time, the progression of the global economic recovery from the broad effects of the pandemic is difficult to assess and estimate the future impact on our results of operations. Accordingly, any estimates of the effects of COVID-19 as reflected or discussed are based upon our best estimates using information known to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such estimates may change in the future, the effects of which could be material.\nThe following is a summary of the performance of our investment segments for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For additional information on financial results, refer to -Results of Operations.\u201d\nDirect Investments - Operating\nThe impact of COVID-19 resulted in occupancy levels nearing historical lows across our direct operating investments at the beginning of 2021. While average occupancy was lower for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020, on a same store basis, our direct operating investments experienced an improved demand and an increase in the number of resident move-ins during 2021. Recent occupancy trends have shown improvements, with average monthly occupancy in December 2021 exceeding the average monthly occupancy in December 2020 by 2.5%. A summary of average occupancy by manager is as follows:\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Average monthly and annual occupancy excludes properties sold.\nOn a same store basis, rental and resident fee income of our direct operating investments declined to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $163.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Overall, average annual occupancy for our direct operating investments declined by 2.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020. However, declines in revenue from lower occupancy were partially offset by rate increases. While occupancy improved during the second half of 2021, our direct operating investments' occupancy levels remain below pre-pandemic averages.\nOn a same store basis, excluding COVID-19 related expenses, property operating expenses of our direct operating investments increased to $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to experience staffing challenges and, in turn, salaries and wages expense has increased due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, sales and marketing expenses have increased with the improved volume of resident move-ins, while the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our managers to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nOverall, on a same store basis, rental and resident fee income, net of property operating expenses, of our direct operating investments decreased to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur direct operating investments incurred COVID-19 related expenses totaling $4.4 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our direct operating investments received and recognized grant income totaling $7.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, from the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. These grants are intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nDirect Investments - Net Lease\nOn a same store basis, we recognized $3.4 million of rental income from our direct net lease investments during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $10.1 million recognized in 2020, excluding straight-line rental adjustments in both periods. A summary of rental income from our direct net lease investments is as follows:\n\u2022The operator of our Arbors portfolio has failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other lease conditions. Contractual monthly rent obligations have been remitted through April 2021 and we have recorded rental income to the extent rental payments were received during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\u2022We sold our Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio in December 2021. The operator remitted full contractual rent per the amended terms of its lease through November 2021. In April 2021, we executed a lease modification that allowed the operator to defer up to $3.0 million of contractual rent payments over the remaining term of the lease, which were forgiven upon the sale of the portfolio.\n\u2022We sold our Smyrna property in May 2021. No rental income was received or recognized from the operator during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnconsolidated Investments\nOverall, our unconsolidated investment portfolios experienced similar operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic as our direct operating investments. Equity in earnings totaled $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to equity in losses of $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Equity in earnings includes our proportionate share of net gains from sales transactions in the Espresso and Eclipse joint ventures, which totaled $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These sales resulted in lower rental income recognized by the joint ventures during the year ended December 31, 2021. Equity in losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes our proportionate share of impairment losses recorded by the underlying joint ventures of our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $38.2 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we received distributions from our unconsolidated investments, which totaled $18.1 million as compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in distributions is primarily a result of increased sales activity during the year ended December 31, 2021. Distributions continued to be limited by reinvestment and development in the Trilogy joint venture, operational challenges in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures and debt repayments in the Espresso joint venture.\nThe following is a summary of operations and performance for the Trilogy, Diversified US/UK, and Espresso joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\u2022Trilogy: Labor shortages, resulting in additional overtime and agency staffing, continued to impact the operations of the predominantly SNF portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, less federal COVID-19 provider relief grants were received and recognized as income during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. While challenged throughout 2021, occupancy and financial results improved during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\u2022Espresso: The joint venture received full contractual rent from its net lease operators during the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2021, the joint venture resumed distributions to its partners for the first time since the second quarter of 2017. During 2021, the portfolio sold 43 properties, or 28% of the portfolio. Net proceeds from the sales were used to repay our mezzanine loan originated to the joint venture. Refer to -Business Update\u201d for further detail on the mezzanine loan repayment.\n\u2022Diversified US/UK: The joint venture received substantially all contractual monthly rent from its net lease and MOB tenants in the United States during the year ended December 31, 2021. SNF and ALF operating portfolios sustained suboptimal occupancy levels and experienced staffing challenges resulting from the continued broad effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The operator of the joint venture's net lease portfolio in the United Kingdom experienced similar effects of the pandemic on its operations, which resulted in a lease modification and lower rental income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDebt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $4.7 million, a decrease from $7.7 million for the ended year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the loan being repaid in full in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a discussion of material events which have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2021 through March 17, 2022.\nSponsor Transaction\nOn February 28, 2022, our former Sponsor, DigitalBridge Group, Inc., or our Former Sponsor, completed the previously announced disposition of its wellness infrastructure platform, or the Sponsor Transaction, which included CNI NSHC Advisors, LLC, or our Advisor, and the individuals currently engaged in the management and oversight of the healthcare platform. The sale resulted in a change of the owner and control of our Advisor to NRF Holdco, LLC, or NRF or our New Sponsor, but did not directly impact the ownership or control of us or any of our assets.\nAdvisory Agreement\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for a one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022 upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but removed our Former Sponsor as the Sponsor and added NRF as the New Sponsor.\nSponsor Line of Credit\nOn February 28, 2022, our Sponsor Line was amended to extend the maturity date to February 28, 2024.\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe healthcare industry, which includes ILFs, ALFs, MCFs, CCRCs, SNFs, MOBs and hospitals, continues to experience the effects of COVID-19, including declines in resident occupancy, lower operating cash flows and compressed operating margins.\nThe CARES Act has provided over $100 billion in grants to eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19. Licensed assisted living providers became eligible to apply for funding under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 2 General Distribution allocation and remain eligible under the Provider Relief Fund Phase 3 and Phase 4 General Distributions. In addition, the CMS has provided accelerated and advance payments to Medicare providers. Operators continue to evaluate their options for financial assistance, such as utilizing programs within the CARES Act as well as other state and local government relief programs. However, the uncertainty regarding future availability of such relief, and its ultimate impact, including the extent to which relief funds from such programs will provide meaningful support for lost revenue and increasing costs, is uncertain. Additionally, although we continue to evaluate and monitor the terms and conditions associated with relief programs, we cannot ensure ultimate compliance with all the requirements related to the assistance received. If any of our operators fail to comply with all of the terms and conditions, they may be required to repay some or all of the grants received and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nHealthcare industry operating results will continue to be impacted to the extent occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels. Further, the healthcare industry anticipates operating margins will continue to be impacted by cost inflation, labor pressures, additional staffing needs and related cost burdens.\nThe healthcare industry's operational and financial recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 will depend on a variety of factors, which may differ considerably across regions, fluctuate over time and are highly uncertain. The healthcare industry experienced a higher pace of move-ins during the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the third quarter of 2021. As a result of overall increase in resident demand, improving consumer sentiment and easing restrictions on visitation and admissions, the seniors housing industry occupancy average rose to 81.0% during the fourth quarter of 2021 from 80.1% in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, annual inventory growth decreased to 2.4% during the fourth quarter of 2021, while construction versus inventory ratio of 5.2% remained elevated in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: The National Investment Centers for Seniors Housing & Care, or NIC).\nSeniors Housing\nNotwithstanding the demographics and forecasted spending growth, economic and healthcare market uncertainty, development, and competitive pressures have had a negative impact on the seniors housing industry, weakening the market's fundamentals and ultimately reducing operating income for managers and operators.\nSupply growth, which has outpaced demand, has challenged the seniors housing industry over the past several years. New inventory, coupled with the average move-in age of seniors housing residents increasing over time, has resulted in declining occupancy for the industry on average. Further, to remain competitive with the new supply, owners and operators of older facilities have increased capital expenditure spending, which in turn has negatively affected cash flow. While off its peak of 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, seniors housing under construction as a share of inventory was 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 (source: NIC). It is expected that, as demographics and demand continues to increase long-term, supply growth will follow.\nAs a result of increased supply, the seniors housing industry has experienced competitive pressures that have limited rent growth over the past several years. Average market rent growth reached its peak of 4.2% in 2016 and has since decreased to 2.3% as of the fourth quarter of 2021, with pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the decline (source: NIC). Limited future supply growth and reestablishing normal operations in a post-pandemic environment will be factors in achieving near and long term revenue growth for the industry.\nFurther, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tight labor market and competition to attract quality staff had resulted in increased wages and personnel costs, resulting in lower margins. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated operating expense growth, with increased staffing needs and personal protective equipment requirements. While it is expected that the increases in expenses to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be temporary, wage and benefits increases may continue to impact the industry's margins in the future, as labor represents 60% of the seniors housing industry's operating expenses (source: Green Street).\nSkilled Nursing\nWhile generally impacted by the same conditions as the seniors housing industry, SNF operators are currently facing various operational, reimbursement, legal and regulatory challenges. Increased wages and labor costs, narrowing of referral networks, shorter lengths of stay, staffing shortages, expenses associated with inspections, enforcement proceedings and legal actions related to professional and general liability claims have contributed to compressed margins and declines in cash flow.\nSNF operators receive a majority of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. With a dependence on government reimbursement as the primary source of their revenues, SNF operators are also subject to intensified efforts to impose pricing pressures and more stringent cost controls, through value-based payments, managed care and similar programs, which could result in lower daily reimbursement rates, lower lease coverage, decreased occupancy and declining operating margins, liquidity and financial conditions.\nOn February 28, 2022, the White House announced a set of reforms, developed by and implemented through HHS, aimed at improving safety and quality of nursing home care. The new initiatives include establishing a minimum nursing home staffing requirement, reducing resident room crowding and reinforcing safeguards against unnecessary medications and treatments. To ensure compliance, in addition to increased government inspections, the White House Administration plans to expand the financial penalties and other enforcement sanctions against facilities not meeting the set standards. These reforms might further increase the cost burdens for our SNF operators and expose them to financial penalties.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nCertain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective and complex judgments, and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time.\nFor a summary of our accounting policies, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe highlight below accounting estimates that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations and/or require significant management judgment and assumptions:\n\u2022Impairment\nOur investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments may be impaired or that carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting these reviews, we consider macroeconomic factors, including healthcare sector conditions, together with asset and market specific circumstance, among other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as compared to the carrying amount of the investment. Fair values can be estimated based upon the income capitalization approach, using net operating income for each property and applying indicative capitalization and discount rates or sales comparison approach, using what other purchasers and sellers in the market have agreed to as price for comparable properties.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment losses totaling $5.4 million on our operating real estate, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio, as a result of lower estimated future cash flows and market value, and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated impairment losses of $145.1 million for operating real estate that we continue to hold as of December 31, 2021. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 for additional information regarding impairment recorded in prior years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not impair any of our investments in unconsolidated ventures. The Eclipse joint venture recorded impairment losses, which have been recognized through our equity in earnings, of which our proportionate share totaled $1.8 million.\nDue to uncertainties over the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time, it is difficult to assess and estimate the further economic effects of COVID-19 with any meaningful precision. As the future impact of COVID-19 will depend on many factors beyond our control and knowledge, the resulting effect on impairment of our operating real estate and investments in unconsolidated ventures may materially differ from our current expectations and further impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nResults of Operations\nImpact of COVID-19\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, the world continued to experience the broad effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare real estate business and investments were challenged by declines in resident occupancy, lower labor force participation rates, which drove increased labor costs, and inflationary pressures on other operating expenses. We continue to monitor the progression of the economic recovery from COVID-19 and its effects on our results of operations and assess recoverability of value across our assets as conditions change.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n\nResident Fee Income\nThe following table presents resident fee income generated by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nResident fee income decreased $12.2 million as a result of property sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Watermark Fountains portfolio sold in December 2021, the Kansas City portfolio in June 2021 and a property within the Aqua portfolio sold in March 2021.\nExcluding properties sold, resident fee income increased $0.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy and rates at our Oak Cottage property.\nRental Income\nThe following table presents rental income generated by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nRental income decreased $19.7 million primarily due to the operator of our Arbors net lease portfolio not remitting full contractual rent during the year ended December 31, 2021, which also resulted in the write-off of straight-line rent receivables. Limited move-ins and elevated move-outs throughout the first half of 2021 resulted in lower average occupancy and rental income recognized by our ILFs. Additionally, the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio was sold in December 2021 and recognized lower contractual rent in 2021 under the amended terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is primarily interest earned on uninvested cash, which has been impacted by declining market interest rates.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income generated by our mezzanine loan debt investment decreased as a result of receiving the full repayment of outstanding principal in August 2021. The borrower funded principal repayments through net proceeds generated from the sale of underlying collateral and available operating cash flow.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nOverall, total operating expenses decreased $6.2 million primarily as a result of property sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Watermark Fountains portfolio sold in December 2021, the Kansas City portfolio in June 2021 and a property within the Aqua portfolio sold in March 2021. Additionally, COVID-19 related expenses were lower during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.\nExcluding properties sold and COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses increased $9.3 million, primarily as a result of our operators experiencing staffing challenges, which has increased salaries and wages due to additional overtime hours and use of agency and contract labor to fill open positions. In addition, the resumption of normalized business operations has allowed our operators to complete deferred repairs and maintenance projects.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\n\nInterest expense decreased $4.4 million primarily as a result of the repayment of mortgage notes payable which were collateralized by properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, average mortgage notes principal balances decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to continued principal amortization, while lower LIBOR has reduced interest expense on our floating-rate debt. Corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line, which was repaid in full in July 2021.\nAsset Management Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management fees - related party decreased $6.1 million as a result of the estimated net asset value effective December 2020 decreasing from the previous estimated net asset value effective December 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.8 million primarily as a result of amortizing our directors' and officers' insurance premium incurred and reimbursed to our Advisor over the term of the policy, beginning in December 2021. The policy premium was expensed as incurred by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we incurred non-operating costs at a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.2 million, primarily as a result of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reduced building depreciation expense in 2021.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, impairment losses on operating real estate totaled $5.4 million, consisting of $4.6 million recognized for one facility within our Winterfell portfolio and $0.8 million for our Smyrna net lease property, which was sold in May 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses totaling $166.0 million were recorded, consisting of $84.9 million recognized for nine facilities within our Winterfell portfolio, $4.2 million for a facility within the Avamere portfolio, $12.5 million for two facilities within the Rochester portfolio and $64.4 million for properties that were sold in 2021.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $7.7 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS, partially offset by a $0.5 million non-operating loss recognized at a property within the Watermark Fountains portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS were received and recognized.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nReal estate property sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted in net realized gains, which totaled $84.0 million and were partially offset by debt extinguishment losses, which totaled $8.7 million. In addition, we recognized gains on distributions that exceeded our carrying value for our investments in the Espresso and Envoy joint ventures, which totaled $4.4 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $0.3 million gain on the settlement of the share-based payment to our Advisor.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures\nThe following table presents the results of our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Represents our proportionate share of revenues and expenses excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO for unconsolidated investments. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion.\nWe recognized equity in earnings from our investments in unconsolidated investments during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to realized gains on property sales in the Eclipse and Espresso joint ventures, as compared to losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to real estate impairments recorded by the Diversified US/UK, Trilogy and Eclipse joint ventures.\nEquity in earnings, after FFO and MFFO adjustments, decreased by $4.2 million as a result of lower COVID-19 provider relief grants received and recognized by the Trilogy joint venture, partially offset by lower tax expense recognized in the Diversified US/UK portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nResident Fee Income\nThe following table presents resident fee income generated by our direct investments (dollars in thousands): \nOn a same store basis, resident fee income decreased $12.0 million primarily as a result of lower occupancy at our ALFs, MCFs and CCRCs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in limited inquiries and tours, which significantly decreased the number of move-ins at our facilities, and increased the number of move-outs during 2020.\nRental Income\nThe following table presents rental income generated by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nRental income decreased $4.1 million primarily due to overall decreases in occupancy at our ILFs and the sale of a net lease property during 2019. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in limited inquiries and tours, which significantly decreased the number of move-ins at our facilities, and increased the number of move-outs in 2020.\nEffective June 1, 2020, we granted a lease concession to the operator of the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio. The concession allowed the operator to defer a portion of contractual rent payments for a 90-day period, with full contractual rent repaid over the 12 months following the concession period. The amount of the deferred rental payments under the lease concession totaled $3.9 million. As there were no substantive changes to the original lease or changes in total cash flows, the concession was not treated as a lease modification and we continued to recognize lease income and receivables under the original terms of the lease.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue decreased primarily as a result of non-recurring service provider incentives recognized by the Winterfell portfolio during 2019, as well as lower interest earned on uninvested cash during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income on Debt Investments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income generated by our one mezzanine loan debt investment totaled $7.7 million, which was comparable to interest income recognized during year ended December 31, 2019.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents property operating expenses incurred by our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nOverall, operating expenses increased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable COVID-19 related expenses, which totaled $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These expenses include personal protective equipment for residents and staff as well as wages for increased staffing and paying a premium for labor in many markets, particularly in communities that were severely impacted by COVID-19.\nExcluding COVID-19 related expenses, operating expenses decreased $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower census in our direct investment operating portfolio resulted in lower utilities and food and beverage costs. Additionally, repairs and maintenance expense was lower year over year, as operators minimized all non-essential projects across our direct investment operating portfolio in response to COVID-19.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table presents interest expense incurred on our borrowings (dollars in thousands):\n\nInterest expense decreased $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of lower average mortgage notes principal balances due to continued principal amortization and loan payoffs. In addition, lower LIBOR reduced interest expense\non our floating rate debt. For the year ended December 31, 2020, corporate interest expense represents interest resulting from the borrowings under our Sponsor Line.\nAsset Management and Other Fees - Related Party\nOur Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value. Asset management and other fees - related party decreased $2.6 million as a result of the declining estimated net asset value year over year.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of significant increases to insurance premiums. Further, we incurred non-operating compensation costs for a property within the Watermark Fountains net lease portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents depreciation and amortization recognized on our direct investments (dollars in thousands):\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 million, primarily as a result of intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the Winterfell and Rochester portfolios in 2019. In addition, impairment losses recognized reduced depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment Loss\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $166.0 million for properties with sustained poor performance, declines in occupancy and operating margins, and which have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, impairment losses on operating real estate and held for sale assets totaled $27.6 million. Impairment was recognized for two ALFs with sustained low occupancy within the Rochester portfolio, two poor performing properties within the Kansas City portfolio and a net lease property classified as held for sale.\nOther Income\nOther income for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 provider relief grants from HHS. These grants were intended to mitigate the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as reimbursements for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19 by our direct operating investments. Provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions of the grants, we will not be required to repay these grants in the future.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $0.3 million gain on the settlement of the share-based payment to our Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2019, realized gains totaled $6.3 million and were primarily related to the sale of two net lease properties and two condominiums units for which we held future interests in the Watermark Fountains portfolio.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Ventures\nThe following table presents the results of our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\n _______________________________________\n(1)Represents our proportionate share of revenues and expenses excluded from the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Refer to -Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional discussion.\nOur proportionate share of losses generated by our unconsolidated ventures increased $30.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to real estate impairments recorded by the Diversified US/UK, Eclipse and Trilogy joint ventures.\nEquity in earnings, after FFO and MFFO adjustments, increased by $3.5 million. Improved performance in the Espresso joint venture, primarily due to full contractual rent collections and lower interest and operating expenses, as well as federal COVID-19 provider relief funds received and recognized by the Trilogy joint venture, were the main contributors to the increase. Non-recurring earnings recognized by the Envoy joint venture upon the completion of the sale of its remaining operating assets in 2019 and declines in operational performance in the Diversified US/UK and Eclipse joint ventures, as a result of the effects of COVID-19, partially offset the increase.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe believe that Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Modified Funds from Operations, or MFFO, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and of us in particular. We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable property, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciable property owned directly or indirectly and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting rules under U.S. GAAP that have been put into effect since the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in the non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO. For instance, the accounting treatment for acquisition fees related to business combinations has changed from being capitalized to being expensed. Additionally, publicly registered, non-traded REITs are typically different from traded REITs because they generally have a limited life followed by a liquidity event or other targeted exit strategy. Non-traded REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation as compared to later years when the proceeds from their initial public offering have been fully invested and when they may seek to implement a liquidity event or other exit strategy. However, it is likely that we will make investments past the acquisition and development stage, albeit at a substantially lower pace.\nAcquisition fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the origination and acquisition of debt investments have been amortized over the life of the investment as an adjustment to interest income, while fees paid to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of equity investments were generally expensed under U.S. GAAP. In both situations, the fees were included in the computation of net income (loss) and income (loss) before equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures and income tax benefit (expense), both of which are performance measures under U.S. GAAP. We adjusted MFFO for the amortization of acquisition fees in the period when such amortization was recognized under U.S. GAAP or in the period in which the acquisition fees were expensed. Acquisition fees were paid in cash that would otherwise have been available to distribute to our\nstockholders. Such fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor or its affiliates and third parties. However, in general, we earned origination fees for debt investments from our borrowers in an amount equal to the acquisition fees paid to our Advisor. Effective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisition of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDue to certain of the unique features of publicly-registered, non-traded REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, or IPA, an industry trade group, standardized a performance measure known as MFFO and recommends the use of MFFO for such REITs. Management believes MFFO is a useful performance measure to evaluate our business and further believes it is important to disclose MFFO in order to be consistent with the IPA recommendation and other non-traded REITs. MFFO adjustments for items such as acquisition fees would only be comparable to non-traded REITs that have completed the majority of their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics as us. Neither the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, nor any other regulatory body has approved the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO. In the future, the SEC or another regulatory body may decide to standardize permitted adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we may need to adjust our calculation and characterization of MFFO.\nMFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure. Although management uses the MFFO metric to evaluate future operating performance, this metric excludes certain key operating items and other adjustments that may affect our overall operating performance. MFFO is not equivalent to net income (loss) as determined under U.S. GAAP. In addition, MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value, since impairment is taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA, and adjust for certain items, such as accretion of a discount and amortization of a premium on borrowings and related deferred financing costs, as such adjustments are comparable to adjustments for debt investments and will be helpful in assessing our operating performance. Similarly, we adjust for the non-cash effect of unrealized gains or losses on unconsolidated ventures. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not calculate MFFO using the same method MFFO is calculated using FFO. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance. The IPA's definition of MFFO excludes from FFO the following items:\n\u2022acquisition fees and expenses;\n\u2022non-cash amounts related to straight-line rent and the amortization of above or below market and in-place intangible lease assets and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from an accrual basis of accounting under U.S. GAAP to a cash basis of accounting);\n\u2022amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt investments;\n\u2022non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments that meet the specified criteria identified in the rules and regulations of the SEC;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) from the early extinguishment of debt;\n\u2022realized gains (losses) on the extinguishment or sales of hedges, foreign exchange, securities and other derivative holdings except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of our business;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including CMBS and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed hedges and foreign exchange holdings;\n\u2022unrealized gains (losses) from the consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting;\n\u2022adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; and\n\u2022adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis as above.\nCertain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves/impairment on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. With respect to debt investments, we consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors,\nincluding but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. Fair value is typically estimated based on discounting expected future cash flow of the underlying collateral taking into consideration the discount rate, capitalization rate, occupancy, creditworthiness of major tenants and many other factors. This requires significant judgment and because it is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the consolidated balance sheets date. If the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral for the debt investment is less than its net carrying value, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. With respect to a real estate investment, a property's value is considered impaired if a triggering event is identified and our estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. The value of our investments may be impaired and their carrying values may not be recoverable due to our limited life. Investors should note that while impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of MFFO, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flow and the relatively limited term of a non-traded REIT's anticipated operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges through operational net revenues or cash flow prior to any liquidity event.\nWe believe that MFFO is a useful non-GAAP measure for non-traded REITs. It is helpful to management and stockholders in assessing our future operating performance once our organization and offering, and acquisition and development stages are complete. However, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-traded REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-traded REITs, including if we were to extend our acquisition and development stage or if we determined not to pursue an exit strategy.\nHowever, MFFO does have certain limitations. For instance, the effect of any amortization or accretion on debt investments originated or acquired at a premium or discount, respectively, is not reported in MFFO. In addition, realized gains (losses) from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains (losses) and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions.\nNeither FFO nor MFFO is equivalent to net income (loss) or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the U.S. GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance. Neither FFO nor MFFO is necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Furthermore, neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO and MFFO attributable to common stockholders (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Primarily represents our proportionate share of liability extinguishment gains, loan loss reserves, transaction costs and amortization of above/below market debt adjustments, straight-line rent adjustments, debt extinguishment losses and deferred financing costs, incurred through our investments in unconsolidated ventures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur current principal liquidity needs are to fund: (i) operating expenses; (ii) principal and interest payments on our borrowings and other commitments; and (iii) capital expenditures, including capital calls in connection with our unconsolidated joint venture investments.\nOur current primary sources of liquidity include the following: (i) cash on hand; (ii) proceeds from full or partial realization of investments; (iii) cash flow generated by our investments, both from our operating activities and distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures; and (iv) secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, including investment-level financing and/or a corporate credit facility.\nOur investments generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, resident fees and interest income, which are reduced by operating expenditures, debt service payments and capital expenditures and are used to pay corporate general and administrative expenses.\nAs of March 17, 2022, we had approximately $191.1 million of unrestricted cash and currently believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital needs for the following 12 months. Liquidity has improved during the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of proceeds received from both consolidated and unconsolidated investment portfolio sales and the full collection of the principal outstanding on our Espresso mezzanine loan debt investment.\nWhile we have the ability to meet our near-term liquidity needs, an extended recovery period from the effects of COVID-19 increases the risk of a prolonged negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur board of directors determined to suspend distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity in February 2019. Our board of directors continues to evaluate our distribution policy on a recurring basis, and more frequently as facts and circumstances warrant. While we do not anticipate recurring dividends in the near future, in light of the cash flow generated by our investments as compared to our capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations, our board will evaluate special distributions in connection with asset sales and other realization of our investments on a case-by-case basis based on, among other factors, current and projected liquidity needs, opportunities for investment in our assets (such as capital expenditure and de-levering opportunities) and other strategic initiatives.\nFor additional information regarding our liquidity needs and capital resources, see below.\nCash From Operations\nWe primarily generate cash flow from operations through net operating income from our operating properties and rental income from our net lease properties, in addition to receiving distributions from our investments in unconsolidated ventures. Net cash used in operating activities was $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, debt service payments on our borrowings exceeded our cash flow from operations. We have utilized proceeds from asset sales and repayments on our mezzanine loan to fund debt service payments, which is expected to continue until occupancy and revenues of our direct investments improve from current levels.\nA substantial majority of our direct investments are operating properties whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks. While our direct operating investments have not experienced any significant issues collecting rents or other fees from residents as a result of COVID-19, cash flow has continued to be negatively impacted by, among other things, suboptimal occupancy levels, rate pressures, increased labor and benefits costs, as well as rising real estate taxes. We expect that these factors will continue to materially impact our revenues, expenses and cash flow generated by the communities of our direct operating investments.\nFor our net lease investment, the operator of our Arbors portfolio has been impacted by the same COVID-19 factors discussed above, which has and will continue to affect its ability and willingness to pay rent. As of March 17, 2022, the operator has satisfied its contractual rent obligations through May 2021 and continues to make partial rental payments based on availability of cash and liquidity. The operator has applied for and benefited from federal relief assistance, however, the operator's ability to pay rent in the future is currently unknown. Numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have also affected or may affect the landlord and its ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent.\nIn addition, we have significant joint ventures and may not be able to control the timing of distributions, if any, from these investments. As of December 31, 2021, our unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures represented 40.3% and 12.3%, respectively, of our total real estate equity investments, based on cost. Our unconsolidated joint ventures, which have been similarly impacted by COVID-19 as our direct investments, are likely to continue to limit distributions to preserve liquidity.\nBorrowings\nWe use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy to leverage our investments while managing refinancing and interest rate risk. We typically finance our investments with medium to long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans, though our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. In addition, our Sponsor has made available a revolving line of credit to provide additional short-term liquidity as needed.\nWe are required to make recurring principal and interest payments on our borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had $943.8 million of consolidated asset-level borrowings outstanding and paid $92.8 million in recurring principal and interest payments on borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our unconsolidated joint ventures also have significant asset level borrowings, which may require capital to be funded if favorable refinancing is not obtained.\nDuring the year, the operator for the Arbors portfolio failed to remit contractual rent and satisfy other conditions under its leases, which resulted in a defaults under the operator's leases, and in turn, resulted in a non-monetary default under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties as of December 31, 2021. We have remitted contractual debt service and are in compliance with the other contractual terms under the mortgage notes collateralized by the properties.\nAs the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence our investments' performance, we may experience defaults in the future and it may have a negative impact on our ability to service or refinance our borrowings.\nOur charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300.0% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage limitation, excluding indirect leverage held through our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any securitized mortgage obligations to third parties, is 75.0% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, our leverage was 53.6% of our assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation. As of December 31, 2021, indirect leverage on assets, other than intangibles, before deducting loan loss reserves, other non-cash reserves and depreciation, held through our unconsolidated joint ventures was 59.5%.\nFor additional information regarding our borrowings, including principal repayments, timing of maturities and loans currently in default, refer to Note 6, Borrowings\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCapital Expenditures Activities\nWe are responsible for capital expenditures for our operating properties and, from time to time, may also fund capital expenditures for certain net lease properties. We continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position, functional and operating standards, increase operating income, achieve property stabilization and enhance the overall value of our assets. However, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will achieve these intended results.\nWe are also party to certain agreements that contemplate development of healthcare properties funded by us and our joint venture partners. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences under our joint venture governing documents for any such failure to fund.\nRealization and Disposition of Investments\nWe will actively pursue dispositions of assets and portfolios where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return, improve our liquidity position and generate value for shareholders. We have made significant investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures with third parties. We may share decision-making authority for these joint ventures that could prevent us from selling properties or our interest in the joint venture. Further, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence the property's performance, it may have a negative impact on our ability to generate desired returns on dispositions.\nDistributions\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually dividends equal to at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to stockholders. We have generated net operating losses for tax purposes and, accordingly, are currently not required to make distributions to our stockholders to qualify as a REIT. Refer to -Distributions Declared and Paid\u201d for further information regarding our historical distributions.\nRepurchases\nWe adopted a share repurchase program, or the Share Repurchase Program, effective August 7, 2012, which enabled stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate our Share Repurchase Program at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. In October 2018, our board of directors approved an amended and restated Share Repurchase Program, under which we only repurchased shares in connection with the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder. On April 7, 2020, our board of directors suspended all repurchases under our existing Share Repurchase Program effective April 30, 2020 in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nOther Commitments\nWe expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor, or its affiliates, pursuant to our advisory agreement, as applicable, in connection with the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. In December 2017, our advisory agreement was amended with changes to the asset management and acquisition fee structure. In June 2021, our advisory agreement was amended and renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021. In connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for further information regarding our advisory fees.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows (dollars in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $31.0 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in cash flow from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022declines in average occupancy, which resulted in lower rent and resident fees collected;\n\u2022less contractual rent collected from direct net lease investment operators; and\n\u2022higher payments for property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and mortgage payable interest, as a result of debt service that was deferred during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities are primarily proceeds from investment dispositions, net of any capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities was $661.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $8.4 million net cash used for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 were from property sales and principal repayments on our real estate debt investment. Cash inflows were used to fund recurring capital expenditures for existing investments and for general operations. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands):\n\nRecurring capital expenditures have increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the resumption of normalized business operations allowing our operators to complete deferred capital improvements.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in financing activities were primarily the repayment of mortgage notes payable collateralized by properties sold during the year, the repayment of the borrowings under the Sponsor Line and continued principal amortization on our mortgage notes. Cash outflows were partially offset by the refinancing of a mortgage note payable for a property within our Aqua portfolio, which generated $6.5 million in net proceeds. Cash flows used in financing activities was $538.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $12.1 million cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily the $35.0 million borrowed under the Sponsor Line, partially offset by principal amortization payments on mortgage notes and repurchases of shares under our Share Repurchase Program.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was a result of the following:\n\u2022collection of a regulatory reserve deposit for a healthcare facility;\n\u2022lower interest expense, due to lower debt principal balances and effective interest rates;\n\u2022lower cash interest payments due to deferred debt service under executed debt forbearance agreements; and\n\u2022lower asset management fees paid in cash.\nCash flow improvements were partially offset by lower rent and resident fee income as well as higher operating expenses as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily recurring capital expenditures for existing investments, partially offset by distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of an equity contribution to our unconsolidated investment in the Diversified US/UK joint venture, partially offset by the net proceeds generated from the sale of two net lease properties and distributions received from unconsolidated investments.\nThe following table presents cash used for capital expenditures, excluding our unconsolidated ventures (dollars in thousands): \nRecurring capital expenditures have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of limiting expenditures in response to COVID-19.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash flows from financing activities were principally impacted by borrowing $35.0 million under our Sponsor Line, partially offset by repurchases of common stock and repayments on our mortgage notes. Cash flows provided by financing activities was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and the repayment of a mortgage note payable upon the sale of two net lease properties were the primary drivers of financing cash flows.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\n____________________________________\n(1)Represents amortization of principal and repayment upon contractual initial maturity date.\n(2)Estimated interest payments are based on the remaining life of the borrowings. Applicable LIBOR rate, plus the respective spread as of December 31, 2021 was used to estimate payments for our floating-rate borrowings.\n(3)Our advisory agreement may be renewed on different terms or may be terminated at any time, subject to notice requirements. As a result, the amount included in the table above is an estimate only and assumes the current net asset value and the continuation of our advisory agreement on its current terms. Refer to -Related Party Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our Advisor asset management fee.\n(4)Excludes construction related and other commitments for future development.\nBorrowings that are maturing in our unconsolidated ventures may require us to fund additional contributions if favorable refinancing is not obtained. We are not obligated to fund capital contributions, however our investment in the unconsolidated investment may be diluted and we may be prohibited from participating in future cash flows if we are unable to fund. In addition, our joint venture partners may be entitled to call additional capital under the governing documents of our joint ventures and certain of our operators and managers may require us to fund capital projects under our leases or management agreements. Although we may not be obligated to fund such capital contributions or capital projects, we may be subject to adverse consequences for any such failure to fund.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in unconsolidated ventures. Refer to Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements. In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nDistributions Declared and Paid\nWe generally paid distributions on a monthly basis based on daily record dates on the first business day of the month following the month for which the distribution was accrued. From the date of our first investment on April 5, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we paid an annualized distribution amount of $0.675 per share of our common stock. Our board of directors approved a daily cash distribution of $0.000924658 per share of common stock, equivalent to an annualized distribution amount of $0.3375 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 and month ended January 31, 2019. Effective February 1, 2019, our board of directors suspended distributions in order to preserve capital and liquidity.\nSince inception of our first investment, we declared $433.8 million in distributions and generated cumulative FFO of $131.9 million. We did not declare any distributions during the year ended December 31, 2021 or year ended December 31, 2020.\nTo the extent distributions are paid from sources other than FFO, the ownership interest of our public stockholders will be diluted. Future distributions declared and paid may exceed FFO and cash flow provided by operations. FFO, as defined, may not reflect actual cash available for distributions. Our ability to pay distributions from FFO or cash flow provided by operations depends upon our operating performance, including the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment, the type and mix of our investments, accounting of our investments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the performance of underlying debt and ability to maintain liquidity. We will continue to assess our distribution policy in light of our operating performance and capital needs.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nAdvisor\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, acquiring, originating and asset managing investments on our behalf. Our Advisor may delegate certain of its\nobligations to affiliated entities, which may be organized under the laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions. References to our Advisor include our Advisor and any such affiliated entities. For such services, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, our Advisor receives fees and reimbursements from us. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our Advisor may defer or waive fees in its discretion. Below is a description and table of the fees and reimbursements incurred to our Advisor.\nIn June 2021, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on June 30, 2021, with terms identical to those in effect through June 30, 2021, but for the following modifications:\n\u2022the payment of the asset management fee entirely in the form of our shares of common stock; and\n\u2022effective January 1, 2022, a reduction of the asset management fee with respect to our corporate cash balance exceeding $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIn connection with the Sponsor Transaction, our advisory agreement was renewed for an additional one-year term commencing on February 28, 2022, upon terms identical to those in effect through February 28, 2022, but for certain updates to remove our Former Sponsor and add NRF as our New Sponsor for certain limited provisions.\nFees to Advisor\nAsset Management Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor receives a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of our most recently published aggregate estimated net asset value, as may be subsequently adjusted for any special distribution declared by our board of directors in connection with a sale, transfer or other disposition of a substantial portion of our assets. Effective July 1, 2021, the asset management fee is paid entirely in shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the most recently published net asset value per share, and effective January 1, 2022, the fee will be reduced if our corporate cash balances exceed $75.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.\nIncentive Fee\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive distributions equal to 15.0% of our net cash flows, whether from continuing operations, repayment of loans, disposition of assets or otherwise, but only after stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their invested capital plus a 6.75% cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such invested capital. From inception through December 31, 2021, our Advisor has not received any incentive fees.\nAcquisition Fee\nEffective January 1, 2018, our Advisor no longer receives an acquisition fee in connection with our acquisitions of real estate properties or debt investments.\nDisposition Fee\nEffective June 30, 2020, our Advisor no longer has the potential to receive a disposition fee in connection with the sale of real estate properties or debt investments.\nReimbursements to Advisor\nOperating Costs\nOur Advisor is entitled to receive reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs incurred by our Advisor in connection with administrative services provided to us. Our Advisor allocates, in good faith, indirect costs to us related to our Advisor's and its affiliates' employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the advisory agreement with our Advisor. The indirect costs include our allocable share of our Advisor's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The indirect costs also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies and other general and administrative costs and expenses. However, there is no reimbursement for personnel costs related to our executive officers (although there may be reimbursement for certain executive officers of our Advisor) and other personnel involved in activities for which our Advisor receives an acquisition fee or a disposition fee. Our Advisor allocates these costs to us relative to its and its affiliates' other managed companies in good faith and has reviewed the allocation with our board of directors, including our independent directors. Our Advisor updates our board of directors on a quarterly basis of any material changes to the expense allocation and provides a detailed review to the board of directors, at least annually, and as otherwise requested by the board of directors. We reimburse our Advisor quarterly for operating costs (including the asset management fee) based on a calculation, or the 2%/25% Guidelines, for the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of our average invested assets; or (ii)\n25.0% of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. Notwithstanding the above, we may reimburse our Advisor for expenses in excess of this limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. We calculate the expense reimbursement quarterly based upon the trailing twelve-month period.\nSummary of Fees and Reimbursements\nThe following table presents the fees and reimbursements incurred and paid to our Advisor (dollars in thousands):\n\n_______________________________________\n(1)Includes $10.6 million paid in shares of our common stock.\n(2)As of December 31, 2021, our Advisor did not have any unreimbursed operating costs which remained eligible to be allocated to us. For the year ended December 31, 2021, total operating expenses included in the 2%/25% Guidelines represented 0.5% of average invested assets and 103.4% of net income without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar non-cash reserves.

housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings, and hospitals. \n\n- 2021 was a transitional period with significant investment sales, financing changes, and portfolio shifts. Key events included selling the Watermark Fountains portfolio, repaying the mezzanine loan in full, borrowing and repaying the $35 million line of credit, and extending debt maturity.\n\n- COVID-19 continued to negatively impact occupancy, labor costs, and inflation. But demand and occupancy improved in the second half of 2021.\n\n- For direct operating properties, resident fee income declined due to property sales. On a same-store basis, revenues were flat but expenses increased due to staffing challenges.\n\n- Rental income declined due to non-payment of rent and sales of net lease properties. \n\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures improved compared to 2020 thanks to gains on property sales. But distributions remained limited due to capital needs.\n\n- Operating cash flow was negative in 2021 as debt payments exceeded revenues. Proceeds from investment sales and repayments funded the shortfall.  \n\n- The company remains current on debt obligations but some joint venture assets face refinancing risk. Liquidity has improved and the company has sufficient capital for the next 12 months.\n\n- The advisor continues to receive fees and reimbursements for managing the company's operations and investments.\n\nIn summary, 2021 was a transitional period for the company's portfolio and performance due to COVID-19 impacts, investment sales, and changes in capital structure. Liquidity has improved but challenges persist for direct operating assets and joint ventures."}
