Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data.\u201d Because of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases of the eye. We have worldwide rights to a portfolio of innovative products and product candidates that include two marketed products utilizing our proprietary mucus penetrating particle drug delivery technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY\u00ae technology, to address medical needs for the front of the eye. Our product candidates and programs include a proprietary regenerative biotherapy for severe ocular diseases and a pipeline of preclinical new chemical entities, or NCEs, targeted to address front and back of the eye diseases.\nOur two marketed products are EYSUVIS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 0.25%, for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, and INVELTYS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1%, a topical twice-a-day ocular steroid for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Both products apply our AMPPLIFY technology to loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications. The AMPPLIFY technology uses selectively-sized nanoparticles that each have a proprietary coating. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus.\nEYSUVIS is the first and only FDA-approved prescription product with an indication for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved EYSUVIS in October 2020, and we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in January 2021. We believe that EYSUVIS' broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies offer a favorable profile for the management of dry eye flares and other dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from short-term treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms. We further believe that these features of EYSUVIS are attractive to prescribing clinicians and EYSUVIS could become the preferred first-line prescription therapy for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, including the treatment of dry eye flares that affect the vast majority of dry eye patients.\nINVELTYS is the first and only FDA-approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The FDA approved INVELTYS in August 2018, and we commercially launched the product in January 2019. INVELTYS has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the target ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. We believe INVELTYS offers advantages over existing post-surgical treatment options.\nUpon the consummation of our acquisition of Combangio, Inc., or Combangio, on November 15, 2021, we acquired Combangio's product candidate, CMB-012, which we now refer to as KPI-012. KPI-012 is our lead product candidate and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects, or PCED, a rare disease of impaired corneal healing. We believe the multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren's Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis. For a further description of our acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d below and for a further description of KPI-012 and PCED, see Item 1, Business.\nWe are also progressing our pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs targeted to address both front and back of the eye diseases. These preclinical development programs include KPI-287, our receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor and our selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, or SEGRMs.\nKPI-287 is designed to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factor pathways, and is administered by suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. SEGRMs are a novel class of therapies designed to modify the downstream activity of the glucocorticoid receptors to exhibit the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the corticosteroid class of therapies while markedly reducing their associated side effects, which we are developing for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.\nWe have retained worldwide commercial rights for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012 and our preclinical development programs. Starting with FDA approval of INVELTYS, we have built a commercial infrastructure with our own focused, specialty sales force which now includes approximately 100 field-based commercial sales personnel. Our sales representatives promote both EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nWe expect to commercialize in the United States any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval as well. We also expect to explore commercialization of EYSUVIS for the treatment of dry eye disease in certain markets outside the United States, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations. Our net losses were $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $542.4 million. As we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in early January 2021 and commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, we have had only limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our sales agreement with Jefferies, LLC, or Jefferies, in at-the-market offerings, or ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford Finance, convertible promissory notes and warrants. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials and engaging in activities to launch and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. As a result of the acquisition of Combangio, we expect to devote substantial financial resources to the research and development and potential commercialization of KPI-012. Although we expect to continue to generate revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such revenue, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, including in connection with our continued development, regulatory approval efforts and commercialization, if any, of KPI-012. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nAcquisition of Combangio, Inc.\nOn November 15, 2021, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, we acquired Combangio, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing regenerative biotherapeutics for severe ocular diseases based on mesenchymal stem cell, or MSCs, secretomes, including, its lead product candidate, CMB-012 for the treatment of PCED, or the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, Combangio became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we refer to CMB-012 as KPI-012.\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition on November 15, 2021, or the Closing, we made an upfront payment of an aggregate of $5.0 million in cash to former Combangio stockholders and other equityholders, or the Combangio Equityholders, subject to customary adjustments, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 7,788,637 shares, or the Deferred Purchase Consideration, of our common stock to the Combangio Equityholders with an aggregate value of approximately $16.1 million, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 6,815,072 shares of common stock which were issued on January 3, 2022 and (ii) an aggregate of 973,565 shares of common stock that have been held back by us and will be issuable subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date (as defined below), or the Initial Holdback Shares. The aggregate value of the Deferred Purchase Consideration was\ncalculated using the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 12, 2021, the last trading day prior to the Closing.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Combangio Equityholders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us the following contingent consideration, or the Contingent Consideration:\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>up to $105.0 million in contingent milestone consideration, of which (i) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with any product candidate whose active ingredient comprises one or more biological factors secreted by MSCs or their progenitors, including KPI-012, or the Product Candidate, in a Phase 2 clinical trial, or the Dosing Milestone, (ii) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with a Product Candidate in a pivotal clinical trial, (iii) $12.5 million would become payable (with up to $6.25 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon regulatory approval by the FDA of marketing and sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions; (iv) $17.5 million would become payable (with up to $8.75 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon the first commercial sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions, and (v) an aggregate of up to $65.0 million would become payable in cash upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>tiered cash royalties at percentage rates in the mid-to-high single digits payable on annual net sales of all Product Candidates; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a cash payment at a percentage rate in the high single digits of all income, including earnout payments, received by us or any of our affiliates from a product license granted by us to a third party to sell or otherwise commercialize the Product Candidate in countries where neither we nor our affiliates conduct sales of such Product Candidate, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in shares of our common stock is referred to herein as Contingent Stock Consideration\u201d and the portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in cash is referred to herein as Contingent Cash Consideration\u201d.\nIf the issuance of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration would result in the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued under the Merger Agreement equaling or exceeding 19.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, or the Share Cap, then we will be required to pay the portion of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration in excess of the Share Cap in cash. If the aggregate amount of Contingent Cash Consideration payable in any calendar year (after giving effect to the Share Cap) exceeds $2,500,000, or the Excess Cash Cap, such excess portion, or the Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration, will be carried forward and, subject to application of the Excess Cash Cap in the following calendar year, become payable on the first business day of the following calendar year. Any Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration outstanding on June 1, 2026 is payable in full on June 1, 2026.\nFormer Combangio Equityholders who are non-accredited investors will receive cash in lieu of any of our common stock that otherwise would be issuable to them pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the Closing, we placed $625,000 of the cash purchase price in an escrow account, or the Escrow Account, to be disbursed in accordance with an escrow agreement with Computershare Corporate Trust Company, N.A., or the Escrow Agreement, as escrow agent, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will place 12.5% of any Contingent Cash Consideration that becomes payable prior to the date that is fifteen months after the Closing, or the Escrow Release Date, into such Escrow Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 12.5% of any Contingent Stock Consideration that becomes payable in common stock prior to the Escrow Release Date will be held back by us, or the Contingent Holdback Shares, and, together with the Initial Holdback Shares, which we collectively referred to herein as the Holdback Shares, will serve as partial security for the satisfaction of indemnification obligations and other payment obligations of the Combangio Equityholders and, subject to reduction in respect of these obligations, the Holdback Shares will be issued to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date.\nBusiness Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn order to safeguard the health of our employees from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are following, and will continue to follow, recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as federal, state, and local governments, regarding working-from-home practices for non-essential employees. We previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but if we suspend all or some in-person interactions with physicians in the future, or to the extent physicians limit in-person interactions, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nIn addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, our clinical development efforts for KPI-012 and our preclinical developments programs, and our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the length and severity of this pandemic, the timing and extent of any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the full extent of the impact on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nManagement is actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, customers, sales force, contractors, and workforce. For additional information on risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor entitled The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic and the efforts to prevent its spread have adversely impacted our operations and the market for INVELTYS, is believed to have impacted the ongoing commercialization of EYSUVIS and could impact the development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop, and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe commenced generating product revenues from sales of INVELTYS in January 2019, and commenced generating revenue from EYSUVIS upon the shipment to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020. Full promotional launch of EYSUVIS began in early January 2021. Our product revenues are recorded net of provisions relating to estimates for (i) trade discounts and allowances, such as discounts for prompt payment and other discounts and distributor fees, (ii) estimated rebates, chargebacks and co-pay assistance programs, and (iii) reserves for expected product returns. These estimates reflect current contractual and statutory requirements, known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from these estimates. If actual results vary, estimates may be adjusted in the period such change in estimate becomes known, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing through most of the second quarter of 2020, prescriptions of INVELTYS and revenue had been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as federal, state and local governments implemented restrictions on elective procedures, which included most ocular surgeries. While many deferred ocular surgeries have been rescheduled as individual states have released restrictions on elective procedures, prescriptions of INVELTYS and related revenue are still being adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and we are unable to project the specific timing or potential impact on future revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also cannot project the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the commercialization of EYSUVIS. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in\npreclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nCost of Product Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of materials, third-party manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs, royalty expense, allocation of labor, quality control and assurance, reserves for defective inventory, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, losses on inventory purchase commitments, and other manufacturing overhead costs. We expensed cost of product revenues related to INVELTYS as research and development expenses prior to U.S. regulatory approval, which we received on August 22, 2018. We expensed cost of product revenues related to EYSUVIS as research and development expenses prior to the determination that FDA approval was probable and before the future economic benefit was expected to be realized. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the cost of product revenues will be impacted consistent with the negative impact to product revenues, net. However, we are unable to predict the specific timing or specific impact on cost of product revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation and travel expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and our executive, finance, human resources, legal, compliance, information technology and business development functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external selling and marketing costs, costs to manufacture sample units and professional fees for auditing, tax, information technology, consultants, legal services and allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of INVELTYS and EYSUVIS, have incurred launch-related expenses during 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially if and when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate. Our sales force has resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field with physicians, which were previously suspended due to the restrictions with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are forced to suspend all or some in-person sales force interactions again in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, selling, general and administrative expenses could be favorably impacted by a reduction in certain expenses associated with the restriction in activities for our sales force and other employees. We are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact if we are forced to resume such restrictions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, an allocation of facilities expenses, overhead expenses and certain outside expenses. Our research and development expenses include:\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expenses incurred for the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, including costs of manufacturing product candidates prior to the determination that FDA approval of a drug candidate is probable and before the future economic benefit of the drug is expected to be realized; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and supplies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expense costs relating to the production of inventory for our product candidates, as research and development expenses within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period incurred, unless we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and we expect the future economic benefit from sales of the drug to be realized. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are capitalized as a prepaid expense until incurred. We track outsourced development costs by development program but do not allocate personnel costs, payments made under our license agreements or other costs to specific product candidates or development programs. These costs are included in Employee-related costs and Other research and development costs in the line items in the tables under Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe expect that our research and development costs will increase in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we continue to advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012, KPI-287 and our SEGRM program. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The probability of success for each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may incur reduced research and development costs resulting from any limitations that may be placed on the laboratory facilities that support our early-stage research. However, we are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact, nor are we able to predict the additional costs, if any, associated with personnel safely resuming their full activities.\nKPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development. Successful development and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials is uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We will continue to make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as ongoing assessments as to the commercial potential of product candidates and our ability to enter into collaborations with respect to each product candidate. We may need to raise additional capital and may seek collaborations in the future to advance our various product candidates. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nWe include costs to acquire or in-license product candidates in acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses. When we acquire the right to develop and commercialize a new product candidate, any upfront payments or any future milestone payments that are recorded at fair value that relate to the acquisition or licensing of such a right are immediately expensed as acquired IPR&D in the period in which they are incurred. These costs are immediately expensed provided that the payments do not also represent processes or activities that would constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, or provided that the product candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use.\nGain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration\nConsideration payable for our acquisitions may include future issuances of our common stock. We record an obligation for such Deferred Purchase Consideration at fair value on the acquisition date. We then revalue our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations, other than changes due to issuance, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of contractual coupon interest, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs and accretion of the final payment fee recognized on our debt arrangements.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, a prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fees on the credit agreement, or the Athyrium Credit Facility, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, or Athyrium.\nGain on Lease Modification\nGain on lease modification represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement we entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. In connection with the modification of this lease, we remeasured the operating right-of-use asset and liability balances and recognized a gain of $1.3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates-which also would have been reasonable-could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We perform the following five steps to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nProduct revenues, net\nWe sell EYSUVIS and INVELTYS primarily to wholesalers in the United States, or Customers. These Customers subsequently resell our products to specialty and other retail pharmacies. In addition to agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with third-party payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts for the purchase of our products.\nThe goods promised in our product sales contracts represent a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue from product sales at the point the Customer obtains control of the product, which occurs upon delivery. The transaction price ( net sales price\u201d) that is recognized as revenue for product sales includes the selling price to the Customer and an estimate of variable consideration. Components of variable consideration include prompt pay and other discounts, product returns, government rebates, third-party payor rebates, coverage gap rebates, incentives such as patient co-pay assistance, and other fees paid to Customers and other third-party payors where a distinct good or service is not received. Variable consideration is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either a reduction of accounts receivable, if payable to a Customer, or as a current liability, if payable to a third-party other than a Customer. We consider all relevant information when estimating variable consideration such as assessment of our current and anticipated sales and demand forecasts, actual payment history, information from third parties regarding the payor mix for products, information from third parties regarding the units remaining in the distribution channel, specific known market events and trends, industry data and current contractual and statutory requirements that are reasonably available. We include estimated amounts for such variable consideration in the net sales price to the extent it is determined probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nPayment terms with Customers do not exceed one year and, therefore, we do not account for a significant financing component in our arrangements. We expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract with a Customer when incurred as the period of benefit is generally less than one year.\nReserves for Variable Consideration:\nTrade Discounts and Allowances\nWe provide our Customers with certain trade discounts and allowances including discounts for prompt payments and other discounts and fees paid for distribution, data and administrative services. These discounts and fees are based on contractually-determined percentages and are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the period in which the related product revenue is recognized.\nChargebacks\nChargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to Customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These components of variable consideration are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits we expect to issue for units that remain in the\ndistribution channel at the end of each reporting period and that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, as well as chargebacks that Customers have claimed, but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we have a product returns policy that provides Customers right of return for product purchased within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of products that may be returned and present this amount as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, in addition to establishing a liability. Our estimates for product returns are based upon available industry data and our own sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel as well as historical returns, which develop over time. Our allowance for product returns has increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of an increase in the actual returns received.\nCommercial Payor and Medicare Part D Rebates\nWe contract with certain third-party payors, primarily pharmacy benefit managers, or PBM's, and health plans, or Plans, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our product. These rebates are based on contractual percentages applied to the amount of product prescribed to patients who are covered by the PBMs or the Plans with which it contracts. We estimate rebates for commercial and Medicare Part D payors based on the contractual discount percentage, the various payor mix for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS as well as future rebates that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. We also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Such estimates are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe are subject to discount obligations under Medicaid and other government programs. For Medicaid, reserves are based on actual payment history, and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Our liability for these rebates consists of estimates of claims for the current period and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nCo-pay Assistance Program\nWe offer a co-pay assistance program (the co-pay program\u201d), which is intended to provide financial assistance to patients who may or may not be covered by commercial insurance or who opt out of Medicare Part D programs. The calculation of accruals for the co-pay program is based on actual claims processed during the period as well as an estimate of the number and cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. Allowances for estimated co-pay claims are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out method. Costs include amounts related to third party manufacturing, transportation, internal labor and overhead. We capitalize pre-launch inventory when we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and expect the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized. In doing so, we consider a number of factors in order to determine the amount of inventory to be capitalized, including the historical experience of achieving regulatory approvals for our similar products, the amount of inventory that is likely to be used in commercial production, receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications and the compilation of the regulatory application. We also monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all\nrelevant communication with regulatory authorities. For inventories capitalized in preparation for product launch, anticipated future sales, expected shelf life and expected approval date are taken into account when evaluating realizability. The shelf life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, we consider the product stability data of all of the pre-launch inventory procured or produced to date to determine whether there is adequate shelf life. If management is aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process, or if the criteria for capitalizing inventory produced prior to regulatory approval are otherwise not met, we would not capitalize such inventory costs, choosing instead to recognize such costs as a research and development expense in the period incurred. For INVELTYS, capitalization of costs as inventory began upon U.S. regulatory approval. For EYSUVIS, capitalization of costs as inventory began in the third quarter of 2020 when we believed regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate was probable and expected the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized.\nWe perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, including quality control and assurance reserves for defective inventories, and we also write-down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of product revenues, unless associated with our samples inventory, in which case the charges are recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nShipping and handling costs for product shipments are recorded as incurred in costs of revenues along with costs associated with manufacturing the product, and any inventory write-downs. Inventory produced that will be used in a promotional sample program is expensed to selling, general and administrative expense when it is designated as a sample. Long-term inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress and/or finished goods inventory with an anticipated consumption or sale beyond one year from the balance sheet date based on our forecasted expectations.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe are required to make significant judgments and estimates to determine whether an acquisition constitutes an acquisition of a business or assets. For asset acquisitions, this includes whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. We are also required to make several significant judgments and estimates in order to determine the total consideration transferred for the asset acquisition and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on a relative fair value basis. If the asset related to acquired IPR&D has no alternative future use, it is expensed immediately upon the completion of the transaction.\nIn addition to upfront consideration, our asset acquisitions may also include contingent consideration payments to be made for future milestone events or royalties on net sales of future products. We assess whether such contingent consideration is required to be recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Contingent consideration payments in an asset acquisition not required to be recorded at fair value are recognized when the contingency is resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments can result from changes to one or more inputs, including adjustments to the probability of achievement, timing of the contingent milestone payments and changes to the applicable discount rates. Significant judgment is used in determining these assumptions during each reporting period. Reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. Any changes in the fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are included in loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For information related to the unobservable inputs related to the contingent consideration, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act, or JOBS Act, was enacted by the federal government. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 318: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,878\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 924\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,993\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,837)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,617\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,805)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,805)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (130,245)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,014)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (389)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,380)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,395)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,395)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on lease modification\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,311\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (142,605)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (104,327)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (38,278)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenues, net\nProduct revenues, net was $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of $6.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $4.9 million from INVELTYS sales, compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of $0.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $6.1 million from INVELTYS sales. The increase in product revenues, net of $4.8 million is primarily the result of sales of EYSUVIS, which we began shipping to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020 and for which we commenced a full commercial launch in January 2021, an increase in the total units of INVELTYS sold in the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as a higher per unit gross selling price of INVELTYS as compared to those sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases in INVELTYS sales were offset by higher estimated allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to those allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect product revenues to increase if and as we increase our market share and obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS from third-party payors; however, revenues could continue to be negatively impacted in 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCost of product revenues\nCost of product revenues was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of product revenues increased $0.9 million due to an increase in total INVELTYS units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as well as a higher INVELTYS cost per unit as a result of the units sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 being partially manufactured prior to its FDA approval and for which costs were expensed as research and development prior to such FDA approval as compared to those units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting these increases was an additional reserve for excess or obsolete inventory of $0.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The cost of product revenues attributable to EYSUVIS was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect the aggregate cost of product revenues to increase as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was an increase of $24.0 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $6.9 million increase in external sales and marketing costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the launch of EYSUVIS. External sales and marketing costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to commercial activities for INVELTYS. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a $14.6 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in employee headcount related to the launch of EYSUVIS and merit-based pay, a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation costs and a $1.7 million increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses, which included facility related costs and certain medical affairs costs attributable to our commercial products. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in costs for administrative and professional service fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, have incurred launch-related expenses in 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 319: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KPI-121 development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (4,302)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,190)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 655\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,837)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $6.8 million. The decrease was primarily the result of a $4.3 million decrease in EYSUVIS development costs related to a decrease in external spend on STRIDE 3, our Phase 3 clinical trial of EYSUVIS, a $3.2 million decrease in employee-related costs largely due to the decrease in the allocation of employee time dedicated to research and development, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in other research and development costs, which included preclinical studies and other facility related costs. We expect research and development costs to increase as we advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $26.6 million. Acquired IPR&D for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes costs associated with the acquisition of acquired in-process research and development from the Acquisition. There were no acquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.8 million and was primarily due to a change in the fair value of our underlying stock price. There was no gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any. The decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.2 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and our Athyrium Credit Facility. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Athyrium Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility until we repaid such indebtedness in full on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $80.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under our Loan Agreement after we drew down the tranche A term loan on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss of extinguishment of debt was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon the repayment in full of all amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fee were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on lease modification\nThe gain on lease modification was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. There was no gain on lease modification for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As we commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, and commenced a full promotional launch of our second product, EYSUVIS, in early January 2021, we have had limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and the Loan Agreement, convertible promissory notes and warrants.\nIn July 2017, we completed an IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which included 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $15.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $94.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of $7.3 million and offering costs of $2.2 million.\nOn August 9, 2018, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on August 27, 2018, or the 2018 Shelf Registration, under which we could initially offer and sell up to $250.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities, purchase contracts, purchase units or any combination of such securities during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2018 Shelf Registration becoming effective. The 2018 Shelf Registration is now expired.\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into the Athyrium Credit Facility with Athyrium for up to $110.0 million. The Athyrium Credit Facility provided for a Term Loan A in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million, and a Term Loan B in the aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million which we did not draw down. On May 4, 2021, concurrently with the closing of the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and the borrowing of the tranche A loan, we utilized substantially all of the proceeds from the tranche A term loan to repay in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, under which we had an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million of indebtedness outstanding. We terminated all commitments by Athyrium to extend further credit under the Athyrium Credit Facility and all guarantees and security interests granted by us thereunder. In connection with the termination of the Athyrium Credit Facility, we paid to the lenders a prepayment premium of $2.25 million and an exit fee of $0.8 million. The transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million, consisting of the prepayment premium, the unamortized debt discount and the unaccreted exit fee.\nOn October 5, 2018, we sold 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $8.25 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, the underwriters were granted an overallotment option to purchase an additional 1,125,000 shares of the common stock at the same public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 11, 2018, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase the overallotment shares. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 8,625,000 shares, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of $66.1 million. In connection with the filing of the 2018 Shelf Registration, we entered into a sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock in an ATM Offering, through Jefferies, as sales agent. Through the first quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 4,945,605 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $25.6 million. On March 10, 2020, we suspended and terminated the prospectus related to the ATM Offering.\nOn March 11, 2020, we sold 16,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $118.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. In addition, the underwriters of the offering were granted the option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of common stock offered in the public offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On April 3, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 979,371 shares of common stock at $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $7.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 16,979,371, resulting in total net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, of $125.4 million.\nUnder the 2018 Shelf Registration, which has now expired, we issued an aggregate of 30,549,976 shares of common stock, including under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of $231.7 million.\nOn May 7, 2020, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 7, 2020, or the 2020 Shelf Registration, under which we may offer and sell up to $350.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities or units during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2020 Shelf Registration becoming effective. In connection with the filing of the 2020 Shelf Registration, we entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of our common stock under our ATM Offering. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,821,059 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $20.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,760,198 shares of our common stock under our ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $41.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, there was $11.3 million of shares of common stock remaining under the ATM Offering that we may issue and sell in the future and, excluding the shares of common stock that may be offered under our ATM Offering, there was $275.0 million of securities available to be issued under the 2020 Shelf Registration.\nOn May 4, 2021, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance, in its capacity as lender, or the Lender, and in its capacity as collateral agent, pursuant to which a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million is available to us, consisting of (i) a tranche A term loan that was disbursed on the closing date of the Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million; (ii) a contingent tranche B term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million available to us through June 30, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $75.0 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions; and (iii) a contingent tranche C term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million available to us through December 31, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $100 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions. The term loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 30-day LIBOR and 0.11%, plus 7.89%. Certain of the customary negative covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability, among other things, to incur future debt, grant liens, make investments, make acquisitions, distribute dividends, make certain restricted payments and sell assets, subject in each case to certain exceptions. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments until December 1, 2024 if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan are made, and until June 1, 2025 if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made, or the Amortization Date. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans are required to be repaid in monthly installments starting on the Amortization Date based on a repayment schedule equal to (i) 18 months if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan is made and (ii) 12 months if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each term loan is due and payable in full on May 1, 2026, or the Maturity Date.\nWe paid a facility fee of $400,000 on the closing date of the Loan Agreement and have agreed to pay a facility fee of $100,000 upon closing of the tranche B term loan and a $125,000 facility fee upon the closing of the tranche C term loan. We will be required to make a final payment fee of 7.00% of the original principal amount of any funded term loan payable on the earlier of (i) the prepayment of the term loan in full or (ii) the Maturity Date. At our option, we may elect to prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding loans, subject to a prepayment fee equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: 3.00% if an advance is prepaid during the first 12 months following the applicable advance date, 2.00% if an advance is prepaid after 12 months but prior to 24 months following the applicable advance date, and 1.00% if an advance is prepaid any time after 24 months following the applicable advance date but prior to the Maturity Date. For further information about the Loan Agreement, see Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration to the former Combangio Equityholders. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Combangio Equityholders are entitled to receive from us, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Contingent Cash Consideration and Contingent Stock Consideration, which would become payable upon our achievement of various development, regulatory and sales milestones and as a result of certain cash royalty payment obligations. At our option, we may satisfy a portion of certain of the milestone payments through either the payment of cash or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock up to the Share Cap. For a full description of the consideration payable as a result of the Acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d above.\nOur other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 primarily related to lease obligations and licensing and commercial supply agreements. For information related to our future commitments for our lease related obligations, see Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements. For information related to our future commitments relating to our licensing and commercial supply agreements, see Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $92.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and as of December 31, 2020, we had $153.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $80.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC. As of December 31, 2020, we had $75.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nOn November 12, 2021, we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021, modifying the lease to accelerate the lease termination date to January 11, 2022, or the Lease Termination\nDate. Under the terms of the lease termination agreement, we received a payment of $2.0 million from the landlord in January 2022 and released $2.0 million of restricted cash on the Lease Termination Date that was pledged as collateral under a letter of credit with cash on deposit required by the terminated lease.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 320: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (108,235)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (90,694)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (17,541)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,209)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (118,074)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (8,275)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,397\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $108.2 million compared to $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.5 million, primarily due to a $10.5 million increase in the net loss adjusted for non-cash charges and the timing of working capital fluctuations which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase. Notable working capital fluctuations include an increase to accounts receivable in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.8 million driven by an increase in sales largely due to the launch of EYSUVIS, whereas accounts receivable had decreased by $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by improved days outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2020. Inventory increased by a greater amount during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to an increase in manufacturing activity for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million, as compared to a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $70.8 million compared to net cash used of $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $149.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the sales or maturities of short-term investments of $76.3 million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $0.1 million, partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of IPR&D, net of cash acquired, of $4.7 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $0.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the purchases of short-term investments of $113.6 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $37.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $42.6 million, a decrease of $118.0 million compared to $160.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $77.8 million of net proceeds from the tranche A term loan under our Loan Agreement, $41.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $1.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the repayment of indebtedness under our Athyrium Credit Facility of $78.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $125.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration, $33.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $2.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future as compared to prior periods as we advance the clinical development of KPI-012. Our research and development expenses will also increase substantially in the future as we advance our preclinical development programs, including KPI-287 and our novel SEGRM program, and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for our product candidates. We continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States and expect selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nOur expenses will also increase if and as we:\nTable 321: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>submit an IND for, and continue the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>initiate and continue the research and development of KPI-012 for additional indications, including initiating and conducting clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to manufacture the clinical supply of KPI-012; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for PCED in the United States and other jurisdictions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for additional indications; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>continue to grow our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in connection with the commercialization of EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any product candidates for which we may submit for and obtain marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 327: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>seek regulatory approval for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS outside of the United States; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 328: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>progress our current and any future preclinical development programs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>conduct clinical trials and other development activities and/or seek marketing approval for any other product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>integrate employees of Combangio; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific, manufacturing, commercial and management personnel, including to support our operations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>expand our operational, financial and management systems; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>increase our product liability insurance coverage as we expand our commercialization efforts for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses. Net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, along with anticipated revenue from EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, will enable us to fund our operations, lease and debt service obligations, and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. As a result, we could deplete our available capital resources sooner or later than we currently expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our expenses will increase from what we anticipate if:\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we elect or are required by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or studies in addition to those expected; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>there are any delays in enrollment of patients in or completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>there are any third-party challenges to our intellectual property portfolio, or the need arises to defend against intellectual property-related claims or enforce our intellectual property rights. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. While we began to generate revenue from the sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in late December 2020 and January 2019, respectively, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future revenue from these products, and we may not achieve profitability. Our lead product candidate, KPI-012, is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all. Achieving and maintaining profitability will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successfully commercializing and growing EYSUVIS and INVELTYS revenues; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>achieving an adequate level of market acceptance, and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any other products we commercialize; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successfully integrating Combangio into our business; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>timely filing of an IND for, and completing the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED and any other indications we determine to pursue; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>subject to obtaining favorable results from our planned clinical trials of KPI-012, applying for and obtaining marketing approval of KPI-012; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successfully commercializing KPI-012, if approved; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>manufacturing at commercial scale, marketing, selling and distributing EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and, if approved, KPI-012; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>maintaining regulatory and marketing approvals for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 348: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>discovering, developing and successfully seeking marketing approval and commercialization of any additional product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hiring and building a full commercial organization required for marketing, selling and distributing those products for which we obtain marketing approval; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>adapting our business in response to the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 and its collateral consequences. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEYSUVIS and INVELTYS are our only products that have been approved for sale, and they have only been approved in the United States. We plan to seek approval in other jurisdictions, but may not do so successfully, or at all. Further, the successful commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States is subject to many risks. As a company, we have limited experience commercializing products, and we may not be able to do so successfully. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product launches and failures to meet expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us. Our revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS alone may not be sufficient for us to become profitable in the near future, if at all. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nIn addition, our commercialization efforts have previously been hampered by the operational restrictions on our sales force from quarantines, travel restrictions and bans and other governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these restrictions, we previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but to the extent we restrict, or are restricted from, in-person interactions with physicians, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. In addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidates that we may develop. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our development and commercialization efforts will depend on the length and severity of this pandemic, including the extent there is any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of the foregoing on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include pledging of assets as collateral, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our Loan Agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Under our Loan Agreement, we are also restricted from incurring future debt, granting liens, making investments, making acquisitions, distributing dividends on our common stock, making certain restricted payments and selling assets and making certain other uses of our cash, without the lenders' consent, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to advance our business. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may again cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to\nexperience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or current or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies, issue new accounting pronouncements. Where applicable, we adopt these new standards according to the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the impact of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation upon adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data.\u201d Because of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases of the eye. We have worldwide rights to a portfolio of innovative products and product candidates that include two marketed products utilizing our proprietary mucus penetrating particle drug delivery technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY\u00ae technology, to address medical needs for the front of the eye. Our product candidates and programs include a proprietary regenerative biotherapy for severe ocular diseases and a pipeline of preclinical new chemical entities, or NCEs, targeted to address front and back of the eye diseases.\nOur two marketed products are EYSUVIS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 0.25%, for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, and INVELTYS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1%, a topical twice-a-day ocular steroid for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Both products apply our AMPPLIFY technology to loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications. The AMPPLIFY technology uses selectively-sized nanoparticles that each have a proprietary coating. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus.\nEYSUVIS is the first and only FDA-approved prescription product with an indication for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved EYSUVIS in October 2020, and we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in January 2021. We believe that EYSUVIS' broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies offer a favorable profile for the management of dry eye flares and other dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from short-term treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms. We further believe that these features of EYSUVIS are attractive to prescribing clinicians and EYSUVIS could become the preferred first-line prescription therapy for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, including the treatment of dry eye flares that affect the vast majority of dry eye patients.\nINVELTYS is the first and only FDA-approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The FDA approved INVELTYS in August 2018, and we commercially launched the product in January 2019. INVELTYS has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the target ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. We believe INVELTYS offers advantages over existing post-surgical treatment options.\nUpon the consummation of our acquisition of Combangio, Inc., or Combangio, on November 15, 2021, we acquired Combangio's product candidate, CMB-012, which we now refer to as KPI-012. KPI-012 is our lead product candidate and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects, or PCED, a rare disease of impaired corneal healing. We believe the multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren's Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis. For a further description of our acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d below and for a further description of KPI-012 and PCED, see Item 1, Business.\nWe are also progressing our pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs targeted to address both front and back of the eye diseases. These preclinical development programs include KPI-287, our receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor and our selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, or SEGRMs.\nKPI-287 is designed to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factor pathways, and is administered by suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. SEGRMs are a novel class of therapies designed to modify the downstream activity of the glucocorticoid receptors to exhibit the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the corticosteroid class of therapies while markedly reducing their associated side effects, which we are developing for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.\nWe have retained worldwide commercial rights for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012 and our preclinical development programs. Starting with FDA approval of INVELTYS, we have built a commercial infrastructure with our own focused, specialty sales force which now includes approximately 100 field-based commercial sales personnel. Our sales representatives promote both EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nWe expect to commercialize in the United States any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval as well. We also expect to explore commercialization of EYSUVIS for the treatment of dry eye disease in certain markets outside the United States, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations. Our net losses were $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $542.4 million. As we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in early January 2021 and commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, we have had only limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our sales agreement with Jefferies, LLC, or Jefferies, in at-the-market offerings, or ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford Finance, convertible promissory notes and warrants. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials and engaging in activities to launch and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. As a result of the acquisition of Combangio, we expect to devote substantial financial resources to the research and development and potential commercialization of KPI-012. Although we expect to continue to generate revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such revenue, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, including in connection with our continued development, regulatory approval efforts and commercialization, if any, of KPI-012. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nAcquisition of Combangio, Inc.\nOn November 15, 2021, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, we acquired Combangio, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing regenerative biotherapeutics for severe ocular diseases based on mesenchymal stem cell, or MSCs, secretomes, including, its lead product candidate, CMB-012 for the treatment of PCED, or the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, Combangio became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we refer to CMB-012 as KPI-012.\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition on November 15, 2021, or the Closing, we made an upfront payment of an aggregate of $5.0 million in cash to former Combangio stockholders and other equityholders, or the Combangio Equityholders, subject to customary adjustments, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 7,788,637 shares, or the Deferred Purchase Consideration, of our common stock to the Combangio Equityholders with an aggregate value of approximately $16.1 million, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 6,815,072 shares of common stock which were issued on January 3, 2022 and (ii) an aggregate of 973,565 shares of common stock that have been held back by us and will be issuable subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date (as defined below), or the Initial Holdback Shares. The aggregate value of the Deferred Purchase Consideration was\ncalculated using the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 12, 2021, the last trading day prior to the Closing.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Combangio Equityholders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us the following contingent consideration, or the Contingent Consideration:\n \u25cf up to $105.0 million in contingent milestone consideration, of which (i) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with any product candidate whose active ingredient comprises one or more biological factors secreted by MSCs or their progenitors, including KPI-012, or the Product Candidate, in a Phase 2 clinical trial, or the Dosing Milestone, (ii) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with a Product Candidate in a pivotal clinical trial, (iii) $12.5 million would become payable (with up to $6.25 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon regulatory approval by the FDA of marketing and sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions; (iv) $17.5 million would become payable (with up to $8.75 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon the first commercial sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions, and (v) an aggregate of up to $65.0 million would become payable in cash upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments; \n \u25cf tiered cash royalties at percentage rates in the mid-to-high single digits payable on annual net sales of all Product Candidates; and \n \u25cf a cash payment at a percentage rate in the high single digits of all income, including earnout payments, received by us or any of our affiliates from a product license granted by us to a third party to sell or otherwise commercialize the Product Candidate in countries where neither we nor our affiliates conduct sales of such Product Candidate, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. \nThe portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in shares of our common stock is referred to herein as Contingent Stock Consideration\u201d and the portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in cash is referred to herein as Contingent Cash Consideration\u201d.\nIf the issuance of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration would result in the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued under the Merger Agreement equaling or exceeding 19.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, or the Share Cap, then we will be required to pay the portion of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration in excess of the Share Cap in cash. If the aggregate amount of Contingent Cash Consideration payable in any calendar year (after giving effect to the Share Cap) exceeds $2,500,000, or the Excess Cash Cap, such excess portion, or the Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration, will be carried forward and, subject to application of the Excess Cash Cap in the following calendar year, become payable on the first business day of the following calendar year. Any Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration outstanding on June 1, 2026 is payable in full on June 1, 2026.\nFormer Combangio Equityholders who are non-accredited investors will receive cash in lieu of any of our common stock that otherwise would be issuable to them pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the Closing, we placed $625,000 of the cash purchase price in an escrow account, or the Escrow Account, to be disbursed in accordance with an escrow agreement with Computershare Corporate Trust Company, N.A., or the Escrow Agreement, as escrow agent, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will place 12.5% of any Contingent Cash Consideration that becomes payable prior to the date that is fifteen months after the Closing, or the Escrow Release Date, into such Escrow Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 12.5% of any Contingent Stock Consideration that becomes payable in common stock prior to the Escrow Release Date will be held back by us, or the Contingent Holdback Shares, and, together with the Initial Holdback Shares, which we collectively referred to herein as the Holdback Shares, will serve as partial security for the satisfaction of indemnification obligations and other payment obligations of the Combangio Equityholders and, subject to reduction in respect of these obligations, the Holdback Shares will be issued to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date.\nBusiness Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn order to safeguard the health of our employees from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are following, and will continue to follow, recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as federal, state, and local governments, regarding working-from-home practices for non-essential employees. We previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but if we suspend all or some in-person interactions with physicians in the future, or to the extent physicians limit in-person interactions, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nIn addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, our clinical development efforts for KPI-012 and our preclinical developments programs, and our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the length and severity of this pandemic, the timing and extent of any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the full extent of the impact on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nManagement is actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, customers, sales force, contractors, and workforce. For additional information on risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor entitled The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic and the efforts to prevent its spread have adversely impacted our operations and the market for INVELTYS, is believed to have impacted the ongoing commercialization of EYSUVIS and could impact the development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop, and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe commenced generating product revenues from sales of INVELTYS in January 2019, and commenced generating revenue from EYSUVIS upon the shipment to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020. Full promotional launch of EYSUVIS began in early January 2021. Our product revenues are recorded net of provisions relating to estimates for (i) trade discounts and allowances, such as discounts for prompt payment and other discounts and distributor fees, (ii) estimated rebates, chargebacks and co-pay assistance programs, and (iii) reserves for expected product returns. These estimates reflect current contractual and statutory requirements, known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from these estimates. If actual results vary, estimates may be adjusted in the period such change in estimate becomes known, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing through most of the second quarter of 2020, prescriptions of INVELTYS and revenue had been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as federal, state and local governments implemented restrictions on elective procedures, which included most ocular surgeries. While many deferred ocular surgeries have been rescheduled as individual states have released restrictions on elective procedures, prescriptions of INVELTYS and related revenue are still being adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and we are unable to project the specific timing or potential impact on future revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also cannot project the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the commercialization of EYSUVIS. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in\npreclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nCost of Product Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of materials, third-party manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs, royalty expense, allocation of labor, quality control and assurance, reserves for defective inventory, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, losses on inventory purchase commitments, and other manufacturing overhead costs. We expensed cost of product revenues related to INVELTYS as research and development expenses prior to U.S. regulatory approval, which we received on August 22, 2018. We expensed cost of product revenues related to EYSUVIS as research and development expenses prior to the determination that FDA approval was probable and before the future economic benefit was expected to be realized. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the cost of product revenues will be impacted consistent with the negative impact to product revenues, net. However, we are unable to predict the specific timing or specific impact on cost of product revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation and travel expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and our executive, finance, human resources, legal, compliance, information technology and business development functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external selling and marketing costs, costs to manufacture sample units and professional fees for auditing, tax, information technology, consultants, legal services and allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of INVELTYS and EYSUVIS, have incurred launch-related expenses during 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially if and when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate. Our sales force has resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field with physicians, which were previously suspended due to the restrictions with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are forced to suspend all or some in-person sales force interactions again in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, selling, general and administrative expenses could be favorably impacted by a reduction in certain expenses associated with the restriction in activities for our sales force and other employees. We are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact if we are forced to resume such restrictions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, an allocation of facilities expenses, overhead expenses and certain outside expenses. Our research and development expenses include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf expenses incurred for the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, including costs of manufacturing product candidates prior to the determination that FDA approval of a drug candidate is probable and before the future economic benefit of the drug is expected to be realized; and \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and supplies. \nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expense costs relating to the production of inventory for our product candidates, as research and development expenses within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period incurred, unless we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and we expect the future economic benefit from sales of the drug to be realized. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are capitalized as a prepaid expense until incurred. We track outsourced development costs by development program but do not allocate personnel costs, payments made under our license agreements or other costs to specific product candidates or development programs. These costs are included in Employee-related costs and Other research and development costs in the line items in the tables under Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe expect that our research and development costs will increase in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we continue to advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012, KPI-287 and our SEGRM program. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The probability of success for each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may incur reduced research and development costs resulting from any limitations that may be placed on the laboratory facilities that support our early-stage research. However, we are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact, nor are we able to predict the additional costs, if any, associated with personnel safely resuming their full activities.\nKPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development. Successful development and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials is uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We will continue to make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as ongoing assessments as to the commercial potential of product candidates and our ability to enter into collaborations with respect to each product candidate. We may need to raise additional capital and may seek collaborations in the future to advance our various product candidates. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nWe include costs to acquire or in-license product candidates in acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses. When we acquire the right to develop and commercialize a new product candidate, any upfront payments or any future milestone payments that are recorded at fair value that relate to the acquisition or licensing of such a right are immediately expensed as acquired IPR&D in the period in which they are incurred. These costs are immediately expensed provided that the payments do not also represent processes or activities that would constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, or provided that the product candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use.\nGain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration\nConsideration payable for our acquisitions may include future issuances of our common stock. We record an obligation for such Deferred Purchase Consideration at fair value on the acquisition date. We then revalue our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations, other than changes due to issuance, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of contractual coupon interest, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs and accretion of the final payment fee recognized on our debt arrangements.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, a prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fees on the credit agreement, or the Athyrium Credit Facility, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, or Athyrium.\nGain on Lease Modification\nGain on lease modification represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement we entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. In connection with the modification of this lease, we remeasured the operating right-of-use asset and liability balances and recognized a gain of $1.3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates-which also would have been reasonable-could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We perform the following five steps to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nProduct revenues, net\nWe sell EYSUVIS and INVELTYS primarily to wholesalers in the United States, or Customers. These Customers subsequently resell our products to specialty and other retail pharmacies. In addition to agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with third-party payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts for the purchase of our products.\nThe goods promised in our product sales contracts represent a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue from product sales at the point the Customer obtains control of the product, which occurs upon delivery. The transaction price ( net sales price\u201d) that is recognized as revenue for product sales includes the selling price to the Customer and an estimate of variable consideration. Components of variable consideration include prompt pay and other discounts, product returns, government rebates, third-party payor rebates, coverage gap rebates, incentives such as patient co-pay assistance, and other fees paid to Customers and other third-party payors where a distinct good or service is not received. Variable consideration is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either a reduction of accounts receivable, if payable to a Customer, or as a current liability, if payable to a third-party other than a Customer. We consider all relevant information when estimating variable consideration such as assessment of our current and anticipated sales and demand forecasts, actual payment history, information from third parties regarding the payor mix for products, information from third parties regarding the units remaining in the distribution channel, specific known market events and trends, industry data and current contractual and statutory requirements that are reasonably available. We include estimated amounts for such variable consideration in the net sales price to the extent it is determined probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nPayment terms with Customers do not exceed one year and, therefore, we do not account for a significant financing component in our arrangements. We expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract with a Customer when incurred as the period of benefit is generally less than one year.\nReserves for Variable Consideration:\nTrade Discounts and Allowances\nWe provide our Customers with certain trade discounts and allowances including discounts for prompt payments and other discounts and fees paid for distribution, data and administrative services. These discounts and fees are based on contractually-determined percentages and are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the period in which the related product revenue is recognized.\nChargebacks\nChargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to Customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These components of variable consideration are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits we expect to issue for units that remain in the\ndistribution channel at the end of each reporting period and that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, as well as chargebacks that Customers have claimed, but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we have a product returns policy that provides Customers right of return for product purchased within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of products that may be returned and present this amount as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, in addition to establishing a liability. Our estimates for product returns are based upon available industry data and our own sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel as well as historical returns, which develop over time. Our allowance for product returns has increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of an increase in the actual returns received.\nCommercial Payor and Medicare Part D Rebates\nWe contract with certain third-party payors, primarily pharmacy benefit managers, or PBM's, and health plans, or Plans, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our product. These rebates are based on contractual percentages applied to the amount of product prescribed to patients who are covered by the PBMs or the Plans with which it contracts. We estimate rebates for commercial and Medicare Part D payors based on the contractual discount percentage, the various payor mix for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS as well as future rebates that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. We also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Such estimates are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe are subject to discount obligations under Medicaid and other government programs. For Medicaid, reserves are based on actual payment history, and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Our liability for these rebates consists of estimates of claims for the current period and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nCo-pay Assistance Program\nWe offer a co-pay assistance program (the co-pay program\u201d), which is intended to provide financial assistance to patients who may or may not be covered by commercial insurance or who opt out of Medicare Part D programs. The calculation of accruals for the co-pay program is based on actual claims processed during the period as well as an estimate of the number and cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. Allowances for estimated co-pay claims are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out method. Costs include amounts related to third party manufacturing, transportation, internal labor and overhead. We capitalize pre-launch inventory when we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and expect the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized. In doing so, we consider a number of factors in order to determine the amount of inventory to be capitalized, including the historical experience of achieving regulatory approvals for our similar products, the amount of inventory that is likely to be used in commercial production, receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications and the compilation of the regulatory application. We also monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all\nrelevant communication with regulatory authorities. For inventories capitalized in preparation for product launch, anticipated future sales, expected shelf life and expected approval date are taken into account when evaluating realizability. The shelf life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, we consider the product stability data of all of the pre-launch inventory procured or produced to date to determine whether there is adequate shelf life. If management is aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process, or if the criteria for capitalizing inventory produced prior to regulatory approval are otherwise not met, we would not capitalize such inventory costs, choosing instead to recognize such costs as a research and development expense in the period incurred. For INVELTYS, capitalization of costs as inventory began upon U.S. regulatory approval. For EYSUVIS, capitalization of costs as inventory began in the third quarter of 2020 when we believed regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate was probable and expected the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized.\nWe perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, including quality control and assurance reserves for defective inventories, and we also write-down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of product revenues, unless associated with our samples inventory, in which case the charges are recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nShipping and handling costs for product shipments are recorded as incurred in costs of revenues along with costs associated with manufacturing the product, and any inventory write-downs. Inventory produced that will be used in a promotional sample program is expensed to selling, general and administrative expense when it is designated as a sample. Long-term inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress and/or finished goods inventory with an anticipated consumption or sale beyond one year from the balance sheet date based on our forecasted expectations.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe are required to make significant judgments and estimates to determine whether an acquisition constitutes an acquisition of a business or assets. For asset acquisitions, this includes whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. We are also required to make several significant judgments and estimates in order to determine the total consideration transferred for the asset acquisition and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on a relative fair value basis. If the asset related to acquired IPR&D has no alternative future use, it is expensed immediately upon the completion of the transaction.\nIn addition to upfront consideration, our asset acquisitions may also include contingent consideration payments to be made for future milestone events or royalties on net sales of future products. We assess whether such contingent consideration is required to be recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Contingent consideration payments in an asset acquisition not required to be recorded at fair value are recognized when the contingency is resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments can result from changes to one or more inputs, including adjustments to the probability of achievement, timing of the contingent milestone payments and changes to the applicable discount rates. Significant judgment is used in determining these assumptions during each reporting period. Reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. Any changes in the fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are included in loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For information related to the unobservable inputs related to the contingent consideration, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act, or JOBS Act, was enacted by the federal government. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 318: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,878\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 924\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,993\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,837)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired in-process research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,617\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,805)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,805)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (130,245)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,014)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (389)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,380)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,395)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,395)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on lease modification\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,311\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (142,605)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (104,327)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (38,278)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct revenues, net\nProduct revenues, net was $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of $6.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $4.9 million from INVELTYS sales, compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of $0.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $6.1 million from INVELTYS sales. The increase in product revenues, net of $4.8 million is primarily the result of sales of EYSUVIS, which we began shipping to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020 and for which we commenced a full commercial launch in January 2021, an increase in the total units of INVELTYS sold in the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as a higher per unit gross selling price of INVELTYS as compared to those sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases in INVELTYS sales were offset by higher estimated allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to those allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect product revenues to increase if and as we increase our market share and obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS from third-party payors; however, revenues could continue to be negatively impacted in 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCost of product revenues\nCost of product revenues was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of product revenues increased $0.9 million due to an increase in total INVELTYS units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as well as a higher INVELTYS cost per unit as a result of the units sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 being partially manufactured prior to its FDA approval and for which costs were expensed as research and development prior to such FDA approval as compared to those units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting these increases was an additional reserve for excess or obsolete inventory of $0.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The cost of product revenues attributable to EYSUVIS was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect the aggregate cost of product revenues to increase as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was an increase of $24.0 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $6.9 million increase in external sales and marketing costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the launch of EYSUVIS. External sales and marketing costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to commercial activities for INVELTYS. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a $14.6 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in employee headcount related to the launch of EYSUVIS and merit-based pay, a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation costs and a $1.7 million increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses, which included facility related costs and certain medical affairs costs attributable to our commercial products. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in costs for administrative and professional service fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, have incurred launch-related expenses in 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 319: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>KPI-121 development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 4,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (4,302)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,190)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other research and development costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 655\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,837)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $6.8 million. The decrease was primarily the result of a $4.3 million decrease in EYSUVIS development costs related to a decrease in external spend on STRIDE 3, our Phase 3 clinical trial of EYSUVIS, a $3.2 million decrease in employee-related costs largely due to the decrease in the allocation of employee time dedicated to research and development, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in other research and development costs, which included preclinical studies and other facility related costs. We expect research and development costs to increase as we advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $26.6 million. Acquired IPR&D for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes costs associated with the acquisition of acquired in-process research and development from the Acquisition. There were no acquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.8 million and was primarily due to a change in the fair value of our underlying stock price. There was no gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any. The decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.2 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and our Athyrium Credit Facility. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Athyrium Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility until we repaid such indebtedness in full on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $80.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under our Loan Agreement after we drew down the tranche A term loan on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss of extinguishment of debt was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon the repayment in full of all amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fee were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on lease modification\nThe gain on lease modification was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. There was no gain on lease modification for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As we commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, and commenced a full promotional launch of our second product, EYSUVIS, in early January 2021, we have had limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and the Loan Agreement, convertible promissory notes and warrants.\nIn July 2017, we completed an IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which included 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $15.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $94.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of $7.3 million and offering costs of $2.2 million.\nOn August 9, 2018, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on August 27, 2018, or the 2018 Shelf Registration, under which we could initially offer and sell up to $250.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities, purchase contracts, purchase units or any combination of such securities during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2018 Shelf Registration becoming effective. The 2018 Shelf Registration is now expired.\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into the Athyrium Credit Facility with Athyrium for up to $110.0 million. The Athyrium Credit Facility provided for a Term Loan A in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million, and a Term Loan B in the aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million which we did not draw down. On May 4, 2021, concurrently with the closing of the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and the borrowing of the tranche A loan, we utilized substantially all of the proceeds from the tranche A term loan to repay in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, under which we had an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million of indebtedness outstanding. We terminated all commitments by Athyrium to extend further credit under the Athyrium Credit Facility and all guarantees and security interests granted by us thereunder. In connection with the termination of the Athyrium Credit Facility, we paid to the lenders a prepayment premium of $2.25 million and an exit fee of $0.8 million. The transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million, consisting of the prepayment premium, the unamortized debt discount and the unaccreted exit fee.\nOn October 5, 2018, we sold 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $8.25 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, the underwriters were granted an overallotment option to purchase an additional 1,125,000 shares of the common stock at the same public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 11, 2018, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase the overallotment shares. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 8,625,000 shares, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of $66.1 million. In connection with the filing of the 2018 Shelf Registration, we entered into a sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock in an ATM Offering, through Jefferies, as sales agent. Through the first quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 4,945,605 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $25.6 million. On March 10, 2020, we suspended and terminated the prospectus related to the ATM Offering.\nOn March 11, 2020, we sold 16,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $118.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. In addition, the underwriters of the offering were granted the option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of common stock offered in the public offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On April 3, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 979,371 shares of common stock at $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $7.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 16,979,371, resulting in total net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, of $125.4 million.\nUnder the 2018 Shelf Registration, which has now expired, we issued an aggregate of 30,549,976 shares of common stock, including under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of $231.7 million.\nOn May 7, 2020, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 7, 2020, or the 2020 Shelf Registration, under which we may offer and sell up to $350.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities or units during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2020 Shelf Registration becoming effective. In connection with the filing of the 2020 Shelf Registration, we entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of our common stock under our ATM Offering. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,821,059 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $20.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,760,198 shares of our common stock under our ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $41.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, there was $11.3 million of shares of common stock remaining under the ATM Offering that we may issue and sell in the future and, excluding the shares of common stock that may be offered under our ATM Offering, there was $275.0 million of securities available to be issued under the 2020 Shelf Registration.\nOn May 4, 2021, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance, in its capacity as lender, or the Lender, and in its capacity as collateral agent, pursuant to which a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million is available to us, consisting of (i) a tranche A term loan that was disbursed on the closing date of the Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million; (ii) a contingent tranche B term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million available to us through June 30, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $75.0 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions; and (iii) a contingent tranche C term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million available to us through December 31, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $100 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions. The term loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 30-day LIBOR and 0.11%, plus 7.89%. Certain of the customary negative covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability, among other things, to incur future debt, grant liens, make investments, make acquisitions, distribute dividends, make certain restricted payments and sell assets, subject in each case to certain exceptions. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments until December 1, 2024 if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan are made, and until June 1, 2025 if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made, or the Amortization Date. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans are required to be repaid in monthly installments starting on the Amortization Date based on a repayment schedule equal to (i) 18 months if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan is made and (ii) 12 months if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each term loan is due and payable in full on May 1, 2026, or the Maturity Date.\nWe paid a facility fee of $400,000 on the closing date of the Loan Agreement and have agreed to pay a facility fee of $100,000 upon closing of the tranche B term loan and a $125,000 facility fee upon the closing of the tranche C term loan. We will be required to make a final payment fee of 7.00% of the original principal amount of any funded term loan payable on the earlier of (i) the prepayment of the term loan in full or (ii) the Maturity Date. At our option, we may elect to prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding loans, subject to a prepayment fee equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: 3.00% if an advance is prepaid during the first 12 months following the applicable advance date, 2.00% if an advance is prepaid after 12 months but prior to 24 months following the applicable advance date, and 1.00% if an advance is prepaid any time after 24 months following the applicable advance date but prior to the Maturity Date. For further information about the Loan Agreement, see Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration to the former Combangio Equityholders. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Combangio Equityholders are entitled to receive from us, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Contingent Cash Consideration and Contingent Stock Consideration, which would become payable upon our achievement of various development, regulatory and sales milestones and as a result of certain cash royalty payment obligations. At our option, we may satisfy a portion of certain of the milestone payments through either the payment of cash or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock up to the Share Cap. For a full description of the consideration payable as a result of the Acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d above.\nOur other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 primarily related to lease obligations and licensing and commercial supply agreements. For information related to our future commitments for our lease related obligations, see Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements. For information related to our future commitments relating to our licensing and commercial supply agreements, see Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $92.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and as of December 31, 2020, we had $153.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $80.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC. As of December 31, 2020, we had $75.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nOn November 12, 2021, we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021, modifying the lease to accelerate the lease termination date to January 11, 2022, or the Lease Termination\nDate. Under the terms of the lease termination agreement, we received a payment of $2.0 million from the landlord in January 2022 and released $2.0 million of restricted cash on the Lease Termination Date that was pledged as collateral under a letter of credit with cash on deposit required by the terminated lease.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 320: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (108,235)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (90,694)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (17,541)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,209)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (118,074)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 5,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (8,275)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,397\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $108.2 million compared to $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.5 million, primarily due to a $10.5 million increase in the net loss adjusted for non-cash charges and the timing of working capital fluctuations which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase. Notable working capital fluctuations include an increase to accounts receivable in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.8 million driven by an increase in sales largely due to the launch of EYSUVIS, whereas accounts receivable had decreased by $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by improved days outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2020. Inventory increased by a greater amount during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to an increase in manufacturing activity for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million, as compared to a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $70.8 million compared to net cash used of $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $149.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the sales or maturities of short-term investments of $76.3 million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $0.1 million, partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of IPR&D, net of cash acquired, of $4.7 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $0.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the purchases of short-term investments of $113.6 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $37.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $42.6 million, a decrease of $118.0 million compared to $160.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $77.8 million of net proceeds from the tranche A term loan under our Loan Agreement, $41.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $1.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the repayment of indebtedness under our Athyrium Credit Facility of $78.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $125.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration, $33.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $2.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future as compared to prior periods as we advance the clinical development of KPI-012. Our research and development expenses will also increase substantially in the future as we advance our preclinical development programs, including KPI-287 and our novel SEGRM program, and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for our product candidates. We continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States and expect selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nOur expenses will also increase if and as we:\n \u25cf submit an IND for, and continue the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED; \n \u25cf initiate and continue the research and development of KPI-012 for additional indications, including initiating and conducting clinical trials; \n \u25cf scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to manufacture the clinical supply of KPI-012; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for PCED in the United States and other jurisdictions; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for additional indications; \n \u25cf continue to grow our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in connection with the commercialization of EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any product candidates for which we may submit for and obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS outside of the United States; \n \u25cf progress our current and any future preclinical development programs; \n \u25cf conduct clinical trials and other development activities and/or seek marketing approval for any other product candidates; \n \u25cf in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf integrate employees of Combangio; \n \u25cf hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific, manufacturing, commercial and management personnel, including to support our operations; \n \u25cf expand our operational, financial and management systems; and \n \u25cf increase our product liability insurance coverage as we expand our commercialization efforts for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. \nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses. Net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, along with anticipated revenue from EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, will enable us to fund our operations, lease and debt service obligations, and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. As a result, we could deplete our available capital resources sooner or later than we currently expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our expenses will increase from what we anticipate if:\n \u25cf we elect or are required by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or studies in addition to those expected; \n \u25cf there are any delays in enrollment of patients in or completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates; \n \u25cf we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; or \n \u25cf there are any third-party challenges to our intellectual property portfolio, or the need arises to defend against intellectual property-related claims or enforce our intellectual property rights. \nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. While we began to generate revenue from the sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in late December 2020 and January 2019, respectively, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future revenue from these products, and we may not achieve profitability. Our lead product candidate, KPI-012, is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all. Achieving and maintaining profitability will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n \u25cf successfully commercializing and growing EYSUVIS and INVELTYS revenues; \n \u25cf achieving an adequate level of market acceptance, and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any other products we commercialize; \n \u25cf successfully integrating Combangio into our business; \n \u25cf timely filing of an IND for, and completing the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED and any other indications we determine to pursue; \n \u25cf subject to obtaining favorable results from our planned clinical trials of KPI-012, applying for and obtaining marketing approval of KPI-012; \n \u25cf successfully commercializing KPI-012, if approved; \n \u25cf manufacturing at commercial scale, marketing, selling and distributing EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and, if approved, KPI-012; \n \u25cf maintaining regulatory and marketing approvals for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS; \n \u25cf discovering, developing and successfully seeking marketing approval and commercialization of any additional product candidates; \n \u25cf hiring and building a full commercial organization required for marketing, selling and distributing those products for which we obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights; and \n \u25cf adapting our business in response to the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 and its collateral consequences. \nEYSUVIS and INVELTYS are our only products that have been approved for sale, and they have only been approved in the United States. We plan to seek approval in other jurisdictions, but may not do so successfully, or at all. Further, the successful commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States is subject to many risks. As a company, we have limited experience commercializing products, and we may not be able to do so successfully. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product launches and failures to meet expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us. Our revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS alone may not be sufficient for us to become profitable in the near future, if at all. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nIn addition, our commercialization efforts have previously been hampered by the operational restrictions on our sales force from quarantines, travel restrictions and bans and other governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these restrictions, we previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but to the extent we restrict, or are restricted from, in-person interactions with physicians, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. In addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidates that we may develop. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our development and commercialization efforts will depend on the length and severity of this pandemic, including the extent there is any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of the foregoing on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include pledging of assets as collateral, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our Loan Agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Under our Loan Agreement, we are also restricted from incurring future debt, granting liens, making investments, making acquisitions, distributing dividends on our common stock, making certain restricted payments and selling assets and making certain other uses of our cash, without the lenders' consent, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to advance our business. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may again cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to\nexperience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or current or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies, issue new accounting pronouncements. Where applicable, we adopt these new standards according to the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the impact of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation upon adoption.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes thereto appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data.\u201d Because of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases of the eye. We have worldwide rights to a portfolio of innovative products and product candidates that include two marketed products utilizing our proprietary mucus penetrating particle drug delivery technology, which we refer to as our AMPPLIFY\u00ae technology, to address medical needs for the front of the eye. Our product candidates and programs include a proprietary regenerative biotherapy for severe ocular diseases and a pipeline of preclinical new chemical entities, or NCEs, targeted to address front and back of the eye diseases.\nOur two marketed products are EYSUVIS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 0.25%, for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, and INVELTYS\u00ae (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 1%, a topical twice-a-day ocular steroid for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. Both products apply our AMPPLIFY technology to loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications. The AMPPLIFY technology uses selectively-sized nanoparticles that each have a proprietary coating. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus.\nEYSUVIS is the first and only FDA-approved prescription product with an indication for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved EYSUVIS in October 2020, and we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in January 2021. We believe that EYSUVIS' broad mechanism of action, rapid onset of relief of both signs and symptoms, favorable tolerability profile and potential to be complementary to existing therapies offer a favorable profile for the management of dry eye flares and other dry eye associated conditions that would benefit from short-term treatment of dry eye signs and symptoms. We further believe that these features of EYSUVIS are attractive to prescribing clinicians and EYSUVIS could become the preferred first-line prescription therapy for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, including the treatment of dry eye flares that affect the vast majority of dry eye patients.\nINVELTYS is the first and only FDA-approved ocular corticosteroid product with a twice-a-day dosing regimen for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The FDA approved INVELTYS in August 2018, and we commercially launched the product in January 2019. INVELTYS has the highest concentration (1%) of LE on the market in the United States and is formulated with our AMPPLIFY technology, which enables INVELTYS to deliver 3.75x more drug to the target ocular tissue compared to an active comparator. We believe INVELTYS offers advantages over existing post-surgical treatment options.\nUpon the consummation of our acquisition of Combangio, Inc., or Combangio, on November 15, 2021, we acquired Combangio's product candidate, CMB-012, which we now refer to as KPI-012. KPI-012 is our lead product candidate and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects, or PCED, a rare disease of impaired corneal healing. We believe the multifactorial mechanism of action of KPI-012 also makes it a platform technology, and we are evaluating KPI-012 for potential expansion to indications for rare front of the eye diseases, such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chemical burns and Sjogren's Syndrome, as well as select rare back of the eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and optic neuritis. For a further description of our acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d below and for a further description of KPI-012 and PCED, see Item 1, Business.\nWe are also progressing our pipeline of proprietary NCE preclinical development programs targeted to address both front and back of the eye diseases. These preclinical development programs include KPI-287, our receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor and our selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, or SEGRMs.\nKPI-287 is designed to inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factor pathways, and is administered by suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. SEGRMs are a novel class of therapies designed to modify the downstream activity of the glucocorticoid receptors to exhibit the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the corticosteroid class of therapies while markedly reducing their associated side effects, which we are developing for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.\nWe have retained worldwide commercial rights for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS, KPI-012 and our preclinical development programs. Starting with FDA approval of INVELTYS, we have built a commercial infrastructure with our own focused, specialty sales force which now includes approximately 100 field-based commercial sales personnel. Our sales representatives promote both EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nWe expect to commercialize in the United States any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval as well. We also expect to explore commercialization of EYSUVIS for the treatment of dry eye disease in certain markets outside the United States, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations. Our net losses were $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $542.4 million. As we commenced a full promotional launch of EYSUVIS in early January 2021 and commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, we have had only limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our sales agreement with Jefferies, LLC, or Jefferies, in at-the-market offerings, or ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and our Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford Finance, convertible promissory notes and warrants. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials and engaging in activities to launch and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. As a result of the acquisition of Combangio, we expect to devote substantial financial resources to the research and development and potential commercialization of KPI-012. Although we expect to continue to generate revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such revenue, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, including in connection with our continued development, regulatory approval efforts and commercialization, if any, of KPI-012. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nAcquisition of Combangio, Inc.\nOn November 15, 2021, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, we acquired Combangio, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing regenerative biotherapeutics for severe ocular diseases based on mesenchymal stem cell, or MSCs, secretomes, including, its lead product candidate, CMB-012 for the treatment of PCED, or the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, Combangio became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we refer to CMB-012 as KPI-012.\nIn connection with the closing of the Acquisition on November 15, 2021, or the Closing, we made an upfront payment of an aggregate of $5.0 million in cash to former Combangio stockholders and other equityholders, or the Combangio Equityholders, subject to customary adjustments, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 7,788,637 shares, or the Deferred Purchase Consideration, of our common stock to the Combangio Equityholders with an aggregate value of approximately $16.1 million, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 6,815,072 shares of common stock which were issued on January 3, 2022 and (ii) an aggregate of 973,565 shares of common stock that have been held back by us and will be issuable subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date (as defined below), or the Initial Holdback Shares. The aggregate value of the Deferred Purchase Consideration was\ncalculated using the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 12, 2021, the last trading day prior to the Closing.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Combangio Equityholders, in the aggregate and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, will also be entitled to receive from us the following contingent consideration, or the Contingent Consideration:\n \u25cf up to $105.0 million in contingent milestone consideration, of which (i) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with any product candidate whose active ingredient comprises one or more biological factors secreted by MSCs or their progenitors, including KPI-012, or the Product Candidate, in a Phase 2 clinical trial, or the Dosing Milestone, (ii) $2.3 million would become payable in cash and $2.7 million would be payable in shares of our common stock upon the first patient dosed with a Product Candidate in a pivotal clinical trial, (iii) $12.5 million would become payable (with up to $6.25 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon regulatory approval by the FDA of marketing and sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions; (iv) $17.5 million would become payable (with up to $8.75 million payable, at our option, in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash) upon the first commercial sale of a Product Candidate in the United States, subject to certain specified reductions, and (v) an aggregate of up to $65.0 million would become payable in cash upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, or the Net Sales Milestone Payments; \n \u25cf tiered cash royalties at percentage rates in the mid-to-high single digits payable on annual net sales of all Product Candidates; and \n \u25cf a cash payment at a percentage rate in the high single digits of all income, including earnout payments, received by us or any of our affiliates from a product license granted by us to a third party to sell or otherwise commercialize the Product Candidate in countries where neither we nor our affiliates conduct sales of such Product Candidate, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. \nThe portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in shares of our common stock is referred to herein as Contingent Stock Consideration\u201d and the portion of any payment of Contingent Consideration payable in cash is referred to herein as Contingent Cash Consideration\u201d.\nIf the issuance of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration would result in the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued under the Merger Agreement equaling or exceeding 19.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, or the Share Cap, then we will be required to pay the portion of the Deferred Purchase Consideration or any Contingent Stock Consideration in excess of the Share Cap in cash. If the aggregate amount of Contingent Cash Consideration payable in any calendar year (after giving effect to the Share Cap) exceeds $2,500,000, or the Excess Cash Cap, such excess portion, or the Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration, will be carried forward and, subject to application of the Excess Cash Cap in the following calendar year, become payable on the first business day of the following calendar year. Any Carry Forward Contingent Cash Consideration outstanding on June 1, 2026 is payable in full on June 1, 2026.\nFormer Combangio Equityholders who are non-accredited investors will receive cash in lieu of any of our common stock that otherwise would be issuable to them pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the Closing, we placed $625,000 of the cash purchase price in an escrow account, or the Escrow Account, to be disbursed in accordance with an escrow agreement with Computershare Corporate Trust Company, N.A., or the Escrow Agreement, as escrow agent, and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will place 12.5% of any Contingent Cash Consideration that becomes payable prior to the date that is fifteen months after the Closing, or the Escrow Release Date, into such Escrow Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 12.5% of any Contingent Stock Consideration that becomes payable in common stock prior to the Escrow Release Date will be held back by us, or the Contingent Holdback Shares, and, together with the Initial Holdback Shares, which we collectively referred to herein as the Holdback Shares, will serve as partial security for the satisfaction of indemnification obligations and other payment obligations of the Combangio Equityholders and, subject to reduction in respect of these obligations, the Holdback Shares will be issued to the Combangio Equityholders on the Escrow Release Date.\nBusiness Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn order to safeguard the health of our employees from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are following, and will continue to follow, recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as federal, state, and local governments, regarding working-from-home practices for non-essential employees. We previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but if we suspend all or some in-person interactions with physicians in the future, or to the extent physicians limit in-person interactions, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market and commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nIn addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization efforts of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, our clinical development efforts for KPI-012 and our preclinical developments programs, and our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the length and severity of this pandemic, the timing and extent of any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the full extent of the impact on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nManagement is actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, customers, sales force, contractors, and workforce. For additional information on risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor entitled The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic and the efforts to prevent its spread have adversely impacted our operations and the market for INVELTYS, is believed to have impacted the ongoing commercialization of EYSUVIS and could impact the development of KPI-012 or any other product candidate we develop, and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nFinancial Operations Overview\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe commenced generating product revenues from sales of INVELTYS in January 2019, and commenced generating revenue from EYSUVIS upon the shipment to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020. Full promotional launch of EYSUVIS began in early January 2021. Our product revenues are recorded net of provisions relating to estimates for (i) trade discounts and allowances, such as discounts for prompt payment and other discounts and distributor fees, (ii) estimated rebates, chargebacks and co-pay assistance programs, and (iii) reserves for expected product returns. These estimates reflect current contractual and statutory requirements, known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from these estimates. If actual results vary, estimates may be adjusted in the period such change in estimate becomes known, which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing through most of the second quarter of 2020, prescriptions of INVELTYS and revenue had been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as federal, state and local governments implemented restrictions on elective procedures, which included most ocular surgeries. While many deferred ocular surgeries have been rescheduled as individual states have released restrictions on elective procedures, prescriptions of INVELTYS and related revenue are still being adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and we are unable to project the specific timing or potential impact on future revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also cannot project the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the commercialization of EYSUVIS. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in\npreclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nCost of Product Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of materials, third-party manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs, royalty expense, allocation of labor, quality control and assurance, reserves for defective inventory, reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, losses on inventory purchase commitments, and other manufacturing overhead costs. We expensed cost of product revenues related to INVELTYS as research and development expenses prior to U.S. regulatory approval, which we received on August 22, 2018. We expensed cost of product revenues related to EYSUVIS as research and development expenses prior to the determination that FDA approval was probable and before the future economic benefit was expected to be realized. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the cost of product revenues will be impacted consistent with the negative impact to product revenues, net. However, we are unable to predict the specific timing or specific impact on cost of product revenues given the continued uncertainty around the impact and duration of the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, commissions, stock-based compensation and travel expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and our executive, finance, human resources, legal, compliance, information technology and business development functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external selling and marketing costs, costs to manufacture sample units and professional fees for auditing, tax, information technology, consultants, legal services and allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of INVELTYS and EYSUVIS, have incurred launch-related expenses during 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially if and when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate. Our sales force has resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field with physicians, which were previously suspended due to the restrictions with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are forced to suspend all or some in-person sales force interactions again in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, selling, general and administrative expenses could be favorably impacted by a reduction in certain expenses associated with the restriction in activities for our sales force and other employees. We are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact if we are forced to resume such restrictions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with our research activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, an allocation of facilities expenses, overhead expenses and certain outside expenses. Our research and development expenses include:\n \u25cf employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; \n \u25cf expenses incurred for the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and under agreements with contract research organizations, including costs of manufacturing product candidates prior to the determination that FDA approval of a drug candidate is probable and before the future economic benefit of the drug is expected to be realized; and \n \u25cf facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and supplies. \nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expense costs relating to the production of inventory for our product candidates, as research and development expenses within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period incurred, unless we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and we expect the future economic benefit from sales of the drug to be realized. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are capitalized as a prepaid expense until incurred. We track outsourced development costs by development program but do not allocate personnel costs, payments made under our license agreements or other costs to specific product candidates or development programs. These costs are included in Employee-related costs and Other research and development costs in the line items in the tables under Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe expect that our research and development costs will increase in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we continue to advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012, KPI-287 and our SEGRM program. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our product candidates. The probability of success for each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may incur reduced research and development costs resulting from any limitations that may be placed on the laboratory facilities that support our early-stage research. However, we are unable to predict the specific amount of this impact, nor are we able to predict the additional costs, if any, associated with personnel safely resuming their full activities.\nKPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development. Successful development and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials is uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. We will continue to make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as ongoing assessments as to the commercial potential of product candidates and our ability to enter into collaborations with respect to each product candidate. We may need to raise additional capital and may seek collaborations in the future to advance our various product candidates. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nWe include costs to acquire or in-license product candidates in acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses. When we acquire the right to develop and commercialize a new product candidate, any upfront payments or any future milestone payments that are recorded at fair value that relate to the acquisition or licensing of such a right are immediately expensed as acquired IPR&D in the period in which they are incurred. These costs are immediately expensed provided that the payments do not also represent processes or activities that would constitute a business\u201d as defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, or provided that the product candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use.\nGain on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration\nConsideration payable for our acquisitions may include future issuances of our common stock. We record an obligation for such Deferred Purchase Consideration at fair value on the acquisition date. We then revalue our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our Deferred Purchase Consideration obligations, other than changes due to issuance, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of contractual coupon interest, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs and accretion of the final payment fee recognized on our debt arrangements.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, a prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fees on the credit agreement, or the Athyrium Credit Facility, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, or Athyrium.\nGain on Lease Modification\nGain on lease modification represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement we entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. In connection with the modification of this lease, we remeasured the operating right-of-use asset and liability balances and recognized a gain of $1.3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates-which also would have been reasonable-could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We perform the following five steps to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only recognize revenue when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.\nProduct revenues, net\nWe sell EYSUVIS and INVELTYS primarily to wholesalers in the United States, or Customers. These Customers subsequently resell our products to specialty and other retail pharmacies. In addition to agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with third-party payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts for the purchase of our products.\nThe goods promised in our product sales contracts represent a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue from product sales at the point the Customer obtains control of the product, which occurs upon delivery. The transaction price ( net sales price\u201d) that is recognized as revenue for product sales includes the selling price to the Customer and an estimate of variable consideration. Components of variable consideration include prompt pay and other discounts, product returns, government rebates, third-party payor rebates, coverage gap rebates, incentives such as patient co-pay assistance, and other fees paid to Customers and other third-party payors where a distinct good or service is not received. Variable consideration is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either a reduction of accounts receivable, if payable to a Customer, or as a current liability, if payable to a third-party other than a Customer. We consider all relevant information when estimating variable consideration such as assessment of our current and anticipated sales and demand forecasts, actual payment history, information from third parties regarding the payor mix for products, information from third parties regarding the units remaining in the distribution channel, specific known market events and trends, industry data and current contractual and statutory requirements that are reasonably available. We include estimated amounts for such variable consideration in the net sales price to the extent it is determined probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nPayment terms with Customers do not exceed one year and, therefore, we do not account for a significant financing component in our arrangements. We expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract with a Customer when incurred as the period of benefit is generally less than one year.\nReserves for Variable Consideration:\nTrade Discounts and Allowances\nWe provide our Customers with certain trade discounts and allowances including discounts for prompt payments and other discounts and fees paid for distribution, data and administrative services. These discounts and fees are based on contractually-determined percentages and are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the period in which the related product revenue is recognized.\nChargebacks\nChargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to Customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These components of variable consideration are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits we expect to issue for units that remain in the\ndistribution channel at the end of each reporting period and that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, as well as chargebacks that Customers have claimed, but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with industry practice, we have a product returns policy that provides Customers right of return for product purchased within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of products that may be returned and present this amount as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, in addition to establishing a liability. Our estimates for product returns are based upon available industry data and our own sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel as well as historical returns, which develop over time. Our allowance for product returns has increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of an increase in the actual returns received.\nCommercial Payor and Medicare Part D Rebates\nWe contract with certain third-party payors, primarily pharmacy benefit managers, or PBM's, and health plans, or Plans, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our product. These rebates are based on contractual percentages applied to the amount of product prescribed to patients who are covered by the PBMs or the Plans with which it contracts. We estimate rebates for commercial and Medicare Part D payors based on the contractual discount percentage, the various payor mix for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS as well as future rebates that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. We also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Such estimates are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nGovernment Rebates\nWe are subject to discount obligations under Medicaid and other government programs. For Medicaid, reserves are based on actual payment history, and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Our liability for these rebates consists of estimates of claims for the current period and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nCo-pay Assistance Program\nWe offer a co-pay assistance program (the co-pay program\u201d), which is intended to provide financial assistance to patients who may or may not be covered by commercial insurance or who opt out of Medicare Part D programs. The calculation of accruals for the co-pay program is based on actual claims processed during the period as well as an estimate of the number and cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel at the end of each reporting period. Allowances for estimated co-pay claims are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out method. Costs include amounts related to third party manufacturing, transportation, internal labor and overhead. We capitalize pre-launch inventory when we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate is probable and expect the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized. In doing so, we consider a number of factors in order to determine the amount of inventory to be capitalized, including the historical experience of achieving regulatory approvals for our similar products, the amount of inventory that is likely to be used in commercial production, receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications and the compilation of the regulatory application. We also monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all\nrelevant communication with regulatory authorities. For inventories capitalized in preparation for product launch, anticipated future sales, expected shelf life and expected approval date are taken into account when evaluating realizability. The shelf life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory, we consider the product stability data of all of the pre-launch inventory procured or produced to date to determine whether there is adequate shelf life. If management is aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process, or if the criteria for capitalizing inventory produced prior to regulatory approval are otherwise not met, we would not capitalize such inventory costs, choosing instead to recognize such costs as a research and development expense in the period incurred. For INVELTYS, capitalization of costs as inventory began upon U.S. regulatory approval. For EYSUVIS, capitalization of costs as inventory began in the third quarter of 2020 when we believed regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of the product candidate was probable and expected the future economic benefit of the drug to be realized.\nWe perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, including quality control and assurance reserves for defective inventories, and we also write-down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of product revenues, unless associated with our samples inventory, in which case the charges are recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required which would be recorded as a cost of product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nShipping and handling costs for product shipments are recorded as incurred in costs of revenues along with costs associated with manufacturing the product, and any inventory write-downs. Inventory produced that will be used in a promotional sample program is expensed to selling, general and administrative expense when it is designated as a sample. Long-term inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress and/or finished goods inventory with an anticipated consumption or sale beyond one year from the balance sheet date based on our forecasted expectations.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe are required to make significant judgments and estimates to determine whether an acquisition constitutes an acquisition of a business or assets. For asset acquisitions, this includes whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. We are also required to make several significant judgments and estimates in order to determine the total consideration transferred for the asset acquisition and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on a relative fair value basis. If the asset related to acquired IPR&D has no alternative future use, it is expensed immediately upon the completion of the transaction.\nIn addition to upfront consideration, our asset acquisitions may also include contingent consideration payments to be made for future milestone events or royalties on net sales of future products. We assess whether such contingent consideration is required to be recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Contingent consideration payments in an asset acquisition not required to be recorded at fair value are recognized when the contingency is resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. Changes in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments can result from changes to one or more inputs, including adjustments to the probability of achievement, timing of the contingent milestone payments and changes to the applicable discount rates. Significant judgment is used in determining these assumptions during each reporting period. Reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. Any changes in the fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities are included in loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For information related to the unobservable inputs related to the contingent consideration, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act, or JOBS Act, was enacted by the federal government. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have\nirrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nProduct revenues, net\nProduct revenues, net was $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of $6.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $4.9 million from INVELTYS sales, compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of $0.3 million from EYSUVIS sales and $6.1 million from INVELTYS sales. The increase in product revenues, net of $4.8 million is primarily the result of sales of EYSUVIS, which we began shipping to wholesalers in the United States in late December 2020 and for which we commenced a full commercial launch in January 2021, an increase in the total units of INVELTYS sold in the year ended December 31, 2021 as well as a higher per unit gross selling price of INVELTYS as compared to those sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases in INVELTYS sales were offset by higher estimated allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to those allowances per unit during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect product revenues to increase if and as we increase our market share and obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS from third-party payors; however, revenues could continue to be negatively impacted in 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCost of product revenues\nCost of product revenues was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of product revenues increased $0.9 million due to an increase in total INVELTYS units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as well as a higher INVELTYS cost per unit as a result of the units sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 being partially manufactured prior to its FDA approval and for which costs were expensed as research and development prior to such FDA approval as compared to those units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting these increases was an additional reserve for excess or obsolete inventory of $0.5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The cost of product revenues attributable to EYSUVIS was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect the aggregate cost of product revenues to increase as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $105.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was an increase of $24.0 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $6.9 million increase in external sales and marketing costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the launch of EYSUVIS. External sales and marketing costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to commercial activities for INVELTYS. Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a $14.6 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in employee headcount related to the launch of EYSUVIS and merit-based pay, a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation costs and a $1.7 million increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses, which included facility related costs and certain medical affairs costs attributable to our commercial products. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in costs for administrative and professional service fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 as we have completed the buildout of our commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, have incurred launch-related expenses in 2021 that we do not expect to incur again in the future related to EYSUVIS or INVELTYS and have terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters, effective January 11, 2022. Until we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012 or any other product candidate, if approved, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will remain largely consistent beyond 2022 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS and as we support our continued research and development activities and seek marketing approval for our product candidates, including KPI-012. We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the research and development expenses incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nResearch and development expenses were $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $6.8 million. The decrease was primarily the result of a $4.3 million decrease in EYSUVIS development costs related to a decrease in external spend on STRIDE 3, our Phase 3 clinical trial of EYSUVIS, a $3.2 million decrease in employee-related costs largely due to the decrease in the allocation of employee time dedicated to research and development, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in other research and development costs, which included preclinical studies and other facility related costs. We expect research and development costs to increase as we advance our development programs and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for product candidates, including KPI-012.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $26.6 million. Acquired IPR&D for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes costs associated with the acquisition of acquired in-process research and development from the Acquisition. There were no acquired IPR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration\nGain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.8 million and was primarily due to a change in the fair value of our underlying stock price. There was no gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, if any. The decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.2 million. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and our Athyrium Credit Facility. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of the contractual coupon interest expense, the amortization of the debt discount and the accretion of the final payment fee associated with our Athyrium Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility until we repaid such indebtedness in full on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $80.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under our Loan Agreement after we drew down the tranche A term loan on May 4, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $75.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss of extinguishment of debt was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon the repayment in full of all amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, prepayment premium and unaccreted exit fee were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGain on lease modification\nThe gain on lease modification was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and represents the gain recognized in connection with the lease termination agreement entered into in November 2021 with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021. There was no gain on lease modification for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As we commercially launched our first product, INVELTYS, in January 2019, and commenced a full promotional launch of our second product, EYSUVIS, in early January 2021, we have had limited revenues to date from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our IPO, follow-on public common stock offerings and sales of our common stock under our ATM Offerings, private placements of preferred stock, borrowings under credit facilities and the Loan Agreement, convertible promissory notes and warrants.\nIn July 2017, we completed an IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which included 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a price of $15.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $94.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of $7.3 million and offering costs of $2.2 million.\nOn August 9, 2018, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on August 27, 2018, or the 2018 Shelf Registration, under which we could initially offer and sell up to $250.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities, purchase contracts, purchase units or any combination of such securities during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2018 Shelf Registration becoming effective. The 2018 Shelf Registration is now expired.\nOn October 1, 2018, we entered into the Athyrium Credit Facility with Athyrium for up to $110.0 million. The Athyrium Credit Facility provided for a Term Loan A in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million, and a Term Loan B in the aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million which we did not draw down. On May 4, 2021, concurrently with the closing of the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and the borrowing of the tranche A loan, we utilized substantially all of the proceeds from the tranche A term loan to repay in full all outstanding amounts owed under the Athyrium Credit Facility, under which we had an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million of indebtedness outstanding. We terminated all commitments by Athyrium to extend further credit under the Athyrium Credit Facility and all guarantees and security interests granted by us thereunder. In connection with the termination of the Athyrium Credit Facility, we paid to the lenders a prepayment premium of $2.25 million and an exit fee of $0.8 million. The transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million, consisting of the prepayment premium, the unamortized debt discount and the unaccreted exit fee.\nOn October 5, 2018, we sold 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $8.25 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, the underwriters were granted an overallotment option to purchase an additional 1,125,000 shares of the common stock at the same public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 11, 2018, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase the overallotment shares. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 8,625,000 shares, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of $66.1 million. In connection with the filing of the 2018 Shelf Registration, we entered into a sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock in an ATM Offering, through Jefferies, as sales agent. Through the first quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 4,945,605 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $25.6 million. On March 10, 2020, we suspended and terminated the prospectus related to the ATM Offering.\nOn March 11, 2020, we sold 16,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration at a public offering price of $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $118.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. In addition, the underwriters of the offering were granted the option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 shares of common stock offered in the public offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. On April 3, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 979,371 shares of common stock at $7.89 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $7.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The total number of shares sold by us in the offering was 16,979,371, resulting in total net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, of $125.4 million.\nUnder the 2018 Shelf Registration, which has now expired, we issued an aggregate of 30,549,976 shares of common stock, including under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of $231.7 million.\nOn May 7, 2020, we filed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on May 7, 2020, or the 2020 Shelf Registration, under which we may offer and sell up to $350.0 million of a variety of securities including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, debt securities or units during the three-year period that commenced upon the 2020 Shelf Registration becoming effective. In connection with the filing of the 2020 Shelf Registration, we entered into an amended and restated sales agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $75.0 million of our common stock under our ATM Offering. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,821,059 shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $20.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,760,198 shares of our common stock under our ATM Offering, resulting in net proceeds to us of $41.2 million. As of December 31, 2021, there was $11.3 million of shares of common stock remaining under the ATM Offering that we may issue and sell in the future and, excluding the shares of common stock that may be offered under our ATM Offering, there was $275.0 million of securities available to be issued under the 2020 Shelf Registration.\nOn May 4, 2021, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance, in its capacity as lender, or the Lender, and in its capacity as collateral agent, pursuant to which a term loan of up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million is available to us, consisting of (i) a tranche A term loan that was disbursed on the closing date of the Loan Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million; (ii) a contingent tranche B term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million available to us through June 30, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $75.0 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions; and (iii) a contingent tranche C term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million available to us through December 31, 2023 and within 90 days of our achieving trailing 6-month product revenue equal to or greater than $100 million, subject to certain other terms and conditions. The term loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 30-day LIBOR and 0.11%, plus 7.89%. Certain of the customary negative covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability, among other things, to incur future debt, grant liens, make investments, make acquisitions, distribute dividends, make certain restricted payments and sell assets, subject in each case to certain exceptions. The Loan Agreement provides for interest-only payments until December 1, 2024 if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan are made, and until June 1, 2025 if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made, or the Amortization Date. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans are required to be repaid in monthly installments starting on the Amortization Date based on a repayment schedule equal to (i) 18 months if neither the tranche B term loan nor the tranche C term loan is made and (ii) 12 months if either the tranche B term loan or the tranche C term loan is made. All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each term loan is due and payable in full on May 1, 2026, or the Maturity Date.\nWe paid a facility fee of $400,000 on the closing date of the Loan Agreement and have agreed to pay a facility fee of $100,000 upon closing of the tranche B term loan and a $125,000 facility fee upon the closing of the tranche C term loan. We will be required to make a final payment fee of 7.00% of the original principal amount of any funded term loan payable on the earlier of (i) the prepayment of the term loan in full or (ii) the Maturity Date. At our option, we may elect to prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding loans, subject to a prepayment fee equal to the following percentage of the principal amount being prepaid: 3.00% if an advance is prepaid during the first 12 months following the applicable advance date, 2.00% if an advance is prepaid after 12 months but prior to 24 months following the applicable advance date, and 1.00% if an advance is prepaid any time after 24 months following the applicable advance date but prior to the Maturity Date. For further information about the Loan Agreement, see Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, we may be required to pay additional contingent consideration to the former Combangio Equityholders. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, former Combangio Equityholders are entitled to receive from us, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Contingent Cash Consideration and Contingent Stock Consideration, which would become payable upon our achievement of various development, regulatory and sales milestones and as a result of certain cash royalty payment obligations. At our option, we may satisfy a portion of certain of the milestone payments through either the payment of cash or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock up to the Share Cap. For a full description of the consideration payable as a result of the Acquisition of Combangio, see Acquisition of Combangio, Inc.\u201d above.\nOur other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 primarily related to lease obligations and licensing and commercial supply agreements. For information related to our future commitments for our lease related obligations, see Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements. For information related to our future commitments relating to our licensing and commercial supply agreements, see Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $92.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and as of December 31, 2020, we had $153.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $80.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC. As of December 31, 2020, we had $75.0 million in indebtedness, which represented the aggregate principal amount that was outstanding under the Athyrium Credit Facility.\nOn November 12, 2021, we entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord for our office and laboratory space at our former corporate headquarters in Watertown, Massachusetts, which was amended on December 22, 2021, modifying the lease to accelerate the lease termination date to January 11, 2022, or the Lease Termination\nDate. Under the terms of the lease termination agreement, we received a payment of $2.0 million from the landlord in January 2022 and released $2.0 million of restricted cash on the Lease Termination Date that was pledged as collateral under a letter of credit with cash on deposit required by the terminated lease.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $108.2 million compared to $90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.5 million, primarily due to a $10.5 million increase in the net loss adjusted for non-cash charges and the timing of working capital fluctuations which accounted for $7.0 million of the increase. Notable working capital fluctuations include an increase to accounts receivable in the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.8 million driven by an increase in sales largely due to the launch of EYSUVIS, whereas accounts receivable had decreased by $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by improved days outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2020. Inventory increased by a greater amount during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to an increase in manufacturing activity for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. Partially offsetting these increases was an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $4.9 million, as compared to a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $70.8 million compared to net cash used of $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $149.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the sales or maturities of short-term investments of $76.3 million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $0.1 million, partially offset by cash paid for the acquisition of IPR&D, net of cash acquired, of $4.7 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $0.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of the purchases of short-term investments of $113.6 million and purchases of property and equipment and other assets of $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $37.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $42.6 million, a decrease of $118.0 million compared to $160.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $77.8 million of net proceeds from the tranche A term loan under our Loan Agreement, $41.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $1.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the repayment of indebtedness under our Athyrium Credit Facility of $78.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $125.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the 2018 Shelf Registration, $33.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the ATM Offering and $2.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nWe anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future as compared to prior periods as we advance the clinical development of KPI-012. Our research and development expenses will also increase substantially in the future as we advance our preclinical development programs, including KPI-287 and our novel SEGRM program, and conduct any necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and other development activities for our product candidates. We continue to commercialize EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States and expect selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially when we pursue the commercialization of KPI-012, if approved, and support commercialization of any other product candidate.\nOur expenses will also increase if and as we:\n \u25cf submit an IND for, and continue the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED; \n \u25cf initiate and continue the research and development of KPI-012 for additional indications, including initiating and conducting clinical trials; \n \u25cf scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to manufacture the clinical supply of KPI-012; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for PCED in the United States and other jurisdictions; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for KPI-012 for additional indications; \n \u25cf continue to grow our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in connection with the commercialization of EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any product candidates for which we may submit for and obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf seek regulatory approval for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS outside of the United States; \n \u25cf progress our current and any future preclinical development programs; \n \u25cf conduct clinical trials and other development activities and/or seek marketing approval for any other product candidates; \n \u25cf in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u25cf integrate employees of Combangio; \n \u25cf hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific, manufacturing, commercial and management personnel, including to support our operations; \n \u25cf expand our operational, financial and management systems; and \n \u25cf increase our product liability insurance coverage as we expand our commercialization efforts for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. \nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses. Net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021, along with anticipated revenue from EYSUVIS and INVELTYS, will enable us to fund our operations, lease and debt service obligations, and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. As a result, we could deplete our available capital resources sooner or later than we currently expect.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our expenses will increase from what we anticipate if:\n \u25cf we elect or are required by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or studies in addition to those expected; \n \u25cf there are any delays in enrollment of patients in or completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates; \n \u25cf we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; or \n \u25cf there are any third-party challenges to our intellectual property portfolio, or the need arises to defend against intellectual property-related claims or enforce our intellectual property rights. \nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. While we began to generate revenue from the sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in late December 2020 and January 2019, respectively, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future revenue from these products, and we may not achieve profitability. Our lead product candidate, KPI-012, is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all. Achieving and maintaining profitability will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n \u25cf successfully commercializing and growing EYSUVIS and INVELTYS revenues; \n \u25cf achieving an adequate level of market acceptance, and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors for EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and any other products we commercialize; \n \u25cf successfully integrating Combangio into our business; \n \u25cf timely filing of an IND for, and completing the clinical development of, KPI-012 for PCED and any other indications we determine to pursue; \n \u25cf subject to obtaining favorable results from our planned clinical trials of KPI-012, applying for and obtaining marketing approval of KPI-012; \n \u25cf successfully commercializing KPI-012, if approved; \n \u25cf manufacturing at commercial scale, marketing, selling and distributing EYSUVIS, INVELTYS and, if approved, KPI-012; \n \u25cf maintaining regulatory and marketing approvals for EYSUVIS and INVELTYS; \n \u25cf discovering, developing and successfully seeking marketing approval and commercialization of any additional product candidates; \n \u25cf hiring and building a full commercial organization required for marketing, selling and distributing those products for which we obtain marketing approval; \n \u25cf obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights; and \n \u25cf adapting our business in response to the current pandemic health event resulting from COVID-19 and its collateral consequences. \nEYSUVIS and INVELTYS are our only products that have been approved for sale, and they have only been approved in the United States. We plan to seek approval in other jurisdictions, but may not do so successfully, or at all. Further, the successful commercialization of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS in the United States is subject to many risks. As a company, we have limited experience commercializing products, and we may not be able to do so successfully. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product launches and failures to meet expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us. Our revenue from sales of EYSUVIS and INVELTYS alone may not be sufficient for us to become profitable in the near future, if at all. Moreover, KPI-012 is in the early stages of clinical development and all of our other research and development programs are in preclinical development and, accordingly, we do not expect to generate revenue from KPI-012 or any other product candidate for several years, if at all.\nIn addition, our commercialization efforts have previously been hampered by the operational restrictions on our sales force from quarantines, travel restrictions and bans and other governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these restrictions, we previously suspended our sales force from substantially all in-person interactions with physicians and were limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2020, our sales force resumed substantially all in-person interactions in the field, but to the extent we restrict, or are restricted from, in-person interactions with physicians, we may be limited to conducting educational and promotional activities virtually, which may continue to hamper our ability to market EYSUVIS and INVELTYS. In addition, government restrictions have at times led to moratoria on elective ocular surgeries in many jurisdictions, which had significantly reduced, and may in the future continue to significantly reduce, the demand for INVELTYS, which is indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has generally had an adverse impact on the launch of pharmaceutical products, and we believe the pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the launch of EYSUVIS. We also do not know the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our development of KPI-012 or any other product candidates that we may develop. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our development and commercialization efforts will depend on the length and severity of this pandemic, including the extent there is any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or any variant strains of the virus, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of the foregoing on our customers, employees, vendors and government agencies, which is uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include pledging of assets as collateral, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our Loan Agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Under our Loan Agreement, we are also restricted from incurring future debt, granting liens, making investments, making acquisitions, distributing dividends on our common stock, making certain restricted payments and selling assets and making certain other uses of our cash, without the lenders' consent, subject in each case to certain exceptions.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to advance our business. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may again cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the volatility of our stock price and trading in our stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to\nexperience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or current or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies, issue new accounting pronouncements. Where applicable, we adopt these new standards according to the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the impact of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation upon adoption.", "item_7_tables": "Table 318: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The increase was primarily due to costs associated with acquiring Combangio and launching EYSUVIS.\n\n- Net loss was $142.6 million in 2021 compared to $104.3 million in 2020. The higher net loss was mainly driven by the increase in operating expenses.\n\n- As of December 31, 2021, Kala had $92.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. This is expected to fund operations into the second quarter of 2023.\n\n- In May 2021, Kala entered into a $125 million term loan agreement with Oxford Finance LLC. This provided $80 million in financing upfront.\n\n- Product revenues were $11.2 million in 2021, up from $6.4 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the launch of EYSUVIS in early 2021.\n\n- R&D expenses decreased to $11.5 million in 2021 from $18.4 million in 2020, primarily due to lower spending on EYSUVIS clinical trials.\n\n- In November 2021, Kala acquired Combangio and its lead asset KPI-012 for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects. This resulted in a $26.6 million charge for acquired in-process R&D.\n\n- Kala expects R&D and SG&A expenses to increase going forward as it advances KPI-012 into later stage trials and prepares for potential commercialization. The company will need to raise additional capital to support these activities."}
