MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and gains from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California and Northern Nevada, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California and Northern Nevada, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million or 11% over net income of $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Pretax income increased by $2.3 million, or 12%, to $21.4 million in 2019 from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet interest income increased by $4.5 million to $37.6 million during 2019 from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $5.0 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $511 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on other interest earning assets increased by $22 thousand. The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million during 2019 ,up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the $8.9 million earned during 2018. The largest component of the decrease in non-interest income was a $1.0 million decline in the gain on sale of SBA loans. Non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand to $22.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The largest component of the increase in non-interest expense was an increase in salary and benefit expense of $871 thousand.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $734 thousand from $5.1 million in 2018 to $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $865 million, an increase of $41 million from $824 million at December 31, 2018. This increase included increases of $53.5 million in loans, $342 thousand in premises and equipment, $328 thousand in bank owned life insurance and $256 thousand in cash. These items were partially offset by decreases of $12.2 million in investment securities, $463 thousand in OREO and $1.0 million in other assets.\nGross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million.\nTotal deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe $20.8 million increase in deposits includes increases of $27.6 million in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, $8.1 million in money market accounts and $6.2 million in savings accounts.These items were partially offset by declines of $2.3 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $18.8 million in time deposits.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nThe return on average assets was 1.82% for 2019, down slightly from 1.83% for 2018. The return on average equity was 20.2% for 2019, down from 23.3% for 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. Average balances are based on average daily balances. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up $4.5 million, or 14%, from $33.1 million during 2018. The $4.5 million included an increase of $5.0 million, or 15%, in interest income, from $34.3 million during 2018 to $39.3 million during the current year and an increase of $511 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on interest-earning bank deposits increased by $22 thousand.\nInterest and fees on loans was $34.3 million during 2019. The average loan balances were $588.8 million for 2019, up $70.2 million from $518.6 million during 2018. The following table compares loan balances by type at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in Each\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in Each\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction & land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>619,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average yield on loans was 5.82% for 2019 up 8 basis points from 5.74% for 2018. We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 37 basis points. At December 31, 2019 approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand as a result of an increase in average balance of $18.1 million from $153.0 million in 2018 to $171.1 million in 2019. Yield on investment securities declined slightly from 2.58% during 2018 to 2.57% in 2019. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $632 thousand in 2019 and $610 thousand in 2018, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $22 thousand increase in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to an increase in the average rate paid on interest earning deposits of 20 basis points from 1.85% during 2018 to 2.05% in 2019 which is consistent with the average federal funds rate during this period. The effect of the increase in yield was mostly offset by a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $2.0 million from $32.9 million during 2018 to $30.9 million in 2019.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $485 thousand from $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, to $1,201 thousand during 2019. This increase mostly relates to an increase in interest expense on money market accounts and time deposits related to the purchase of our Carson City, Nevada branch on October 26, 2018. The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which Plumas Bank pays in other markets. To date we have maintained the rates on the money market accounts at this branch but have experienced a decrease in deposits mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 money market accounts housed at our Carson City branch averaged $14.9 million and time deposits at this branch averaged $11.2 million. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $277 thousand to $411 thousand related to an increase in average rate paid of 28 basis points and an increase in average balances of $17.3 million from $69.4 million during 2018 to $86.7 million during 2019. Interest on time deposits increased by $197 thousand from $192 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $389 thousand during 2019. During this same period average time deposits increased by $4.1 million and the average rate paid on time deposit increased by 37 basis points.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $26 thousand from $520 thousand during 2018 to $546 thousand during the current period mostly related to an increase in rate paid on junior subordinated debentures. Interest on the debentures, which totaled $531 thousand during 2019 and $510 thousand during 2018, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nNet interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2019 increased to 4.75%, from 4.70% during 2018.\n2018 compared to 2017. Net interest income was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, up $5.2 million, or 18%, from $27.9 million during 2017. The $5.2 million included an increase of $5.4 million, or 18.5%, in interest income, from $28.9 million during 2017 to $34.3 million during 2018 and an increase of $219 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.0 million and interest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million. Interest on deposits decreased by $64 thousand. The increases in interest on loans and investments include both an increase in average balance and an increase in average yield.\nInterest and fees on loans was $29.8 million during 2018. The average loan balances were $518.6 million for 2018, up $46.9 million from the $471.7 million during 2017.\nThe average yield on loans was 5.74% for 2018 up 27 basis points from 5.47% for 2017. We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 81 basis points. At December 31, 2018 approximately 28% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million as a result of an increase in yield of 41 basis points from 2.17% during 2017 to 2.58% during 2018 and an increase in average balance from $114.5 million in 2017 to $153.0 million in 2018. During the current period yield benefited from market conditions and the maturity, sales and payments on lower earning securities. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $610 thousand in 2018 and $674 thousand in 2017, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $64 thousand decrease in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $23.6 million from $56.5 million during 2017 to $32.9 million in 2018. The decrease in average balance was mostly offset by an increase in yield of 66 basis points from 119 basis points in 2017 to 185 basis points in 2018; consistent with the increase in the average fed funds rate during these periods.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $134 thousand to $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $582 thousand in 2017. Of this increase, $81 thousand relates to interest at our Carson City branch . The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which the Bank pays in other markets and we would expect some runoff on these accounts as they reprice over time. Interest expense on NOW accounts increased by $7 thousand. Rates paid on NOW accounts averaged 0.09% during 2018 and 2017. Average balances increased by $6.6 million to $103.5 million during 2018 from $96.9 million during 2017. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $50 thousand to $134 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. Rates paid on money market accounts averaged 0.19% during 2018 and 0.14% in 2017. The increase is primarily related to higher cost money market accounts at the Carson City branch. Average balances increased by $10.8 million from $58.6 million in 2017 to $69.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Much of this increase is associated with the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $30 thousand as we continued to experience growth in this category of deposits. Average savings deposits increased by $17.1 million from $159.7 million during 2017 to $176.8 million during 2018. The average rate paid on savings accounts was 17 basis points in 2018 and 2017.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $47 thousand from $145 thousand during 2017 to $192 thousand during 2018 primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Carson City branch Average time deposits declined by $2.7 million from $47.4 million during 2017 to $44.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits was 0.43% in 2018 and 0.31% during 2017.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $85 thousand from $435 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $520 thousand during the current twelve-month period. Interest expense on the Company's note payable decreased by $28 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was related to a decrease in average borrowings on this note from $700 thousand during 2017 to $0 in 2018. The note payable was paid off in April of 2017. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $109 thousand to $510 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.\nAs a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2018 increased to 4.70%, from 4.35% during 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to repay their loan. The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.\nThese estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio. However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change during Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interchange revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(136 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings on bank owned life insurance policies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on sale of investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(158 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on equity securities with no readily determinable fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The largest component of this decrease was a decline of $1.0 million in gains on sale of SBA loans from $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $867 thousand during 2019. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $19.5 million during 2019 and $41.7 million during 2018. Loans originated for sale totaled $20.4 million during 2019 compared to $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. We attribute some of the decline in originations to the government shutdown during the first quarter of 2019. During the shutdown we were unable to provide SBA guaranteed loans. In addition, higher market rates have resulted in a decrease in demand and competition in the SBA lending market remains intense. Loan servicing income, which decreased by $40 thousand, represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold into the secondary market. At December 31, 2019 we were servicing $116 million in guaranteed portions of loans, a decrease of $6 million from $122 million at December 31, 2018. Non-interest income benefited during the 2018 period from a $209 thousand gain recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities, which in our case consists of stock in our correspondent banks, without a readily determinable fair market value. No gain or loss was recorded on these investment securities during the current period.\nPartially offsetting these declines in non-interest income were increases of $119 thousand in service charge income and $200 thousand in interchange income mostly related to an increase in the size of the bank. Other increases in non-interest income included a $114 thousand gain on sale of investment securities and an increase in dividends on FHLB stock of $77 thousand related to an increase in the dividend rate as well as an increase in holdings of FHLB stock.\n2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $8.9 million, an increase of $601 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Included in this increase were two items of a non-recurring nature. A $209 thousand gain was recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities and the loss on sale of investment securities declined by $150 thousand to $8 thousand in 2018. Other significant increases in non-interest income included $109 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, $187 thousand in interchange income and $69 thousand in loan service fees. We attribute these increases primarily to growth in the bank.\nThe largest decrease in non-interest income was a $136 thousand decline in gains on sale of loans. The decline in gain on sale relates to a decline in the average premium received on sale. Gains on sale of loans mostly relate to sales of SBA 7(a) loans. Gains on sale of loans decreased from $2.0 million during 2017 to $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $41.7 million during 2018 and $36.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Loans originated for sale totaled $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and $31.3 million during 2017. Loan servicing income increased by $69 thousand; at December 31, 2018 we were servicing $122 million in guaranteed portions of loans, an increase of $9 million from $113 million at December 31, 2017.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

During 2019 non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand, or 4% to $22.8 million, up from $21.8 million during 2018. Total non-interest expense related to our Carson City, Nevada branch was $866 thousand during 2019 and $340 thousand during 2018. Excluding the effect of the Carson City branch, non-interest expense would have increased by 2% .\nThe Company's single largest expense is salary and benefit costs. During 2019, salary and benefit expense increased by $871 thousand, or 7%, to $13.0 million. Salary expense increased by $1.0 million related to annual merit and promotion increases, an increase of seven Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employees and a full year of operations of our Carson City, Nevada branch. Other significant increases in salary and benefit expense include a decline of $226 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs and an increase of $114 thousand in medical insurance expense. Partially offsetting these items was a decline of $544 thousand in commission expense consistent with the decline in SBA sales. Other significant increases in non-interest expense include $349 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense, $236 thousand in amortization of core deposit intangible, $176 thousand in director compensation and expense and $157 thousand in outside service fees. The largest decreases in non-interest expense were $228 thousand in gain on sale of OREO properties and reductions in professional fees of $221 thousand, deposit insurance expense of $172 thousand, other non-interest expense of $153 thousand and $115 thousand in the provision for change in OREO valuation.\nOf the $349 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment costs, $139 thousand relates to the Carson City, Nevada branch. Of the remaining increase the three largest items were increases of $74 thousand in equipment depreciation, $74 thousand in software costs and $38 thousand in rent expense. The increase in amortization of core deposit intangible is related to the amortization of the core deposit intangible recorded on the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Director compensation and expense was abnormally low during the 2018 period as it included the reversal of accrued retirement costs related to our former director John Flournoy who elected not to run for reelection in 2018 and instead allowed his board term to expire as of May 16, 2018. Mr. Flournoy did not meet the minimum years of service required under his agreement to receive benefits. In addition, during 2019 we have added two new Board members. The increase in outside services primarily relates to growth in the Bank.\nProfessional fees during the current period benefited from a reduction in consulting costs of $109 thousand and corporate legal costs of $127 thousand. Consulting costs were somewhat high during the 2018 period as they included an external review of our compliance management system and $29 thousand related to our acquisition of the Carson City, Nevada branch. Legal fees during the 2018 period included $44 thousand related to the Carson City branch acquisition and $45 associated with litigation brought by a third-party municipality against one of our borrowers which could adversely affect our collateral position. Deposit insurance costs during the current period benefited from assessment credits we were able to apply to our deposit insurance billings. Plumas Bank was awarded assessment credits totaling $177 thousand which became available once the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached at least 1.38. During the third quarter we were notified that the reserve ratio was 1.40 on June 30, 2019 and that our credits would be available to offset insurance assessments beginning with the April 1, 2019 assessment period. Other non-interest expense during the 2018 period was also higher than normal as it included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments and costs associated with the pending termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. During 2018 we purchased a building in Tahoe City which, after remodeling is complete, will become the new home of our Tahoe City branch. Our lease obligation at our current location includes a termination penalty that during 2018 has been accrued into other expense. During 2019 we sold three OREO properties recording a net gain on sale of $275 thousand.\n2018 compared to 2017. Non-interest expense increased by $1.7 million to $21.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $20.1 million during 2017. The three largest components of this increase were increases of $633 thousand in salaries and benefits, $313 thousand in professional fees and $352 thousand in Other. The largest components of the increase in salary and benefit expense were increases of $762 thousand in salary expense and $386 thousand in bonus expense. Salary expense increased to $9.5 million related to additions to staff and merit and promotion increases. Total FTE increased from 142 at December 31, 2017 to 155 at December 31, 2018. This increase includes 4 FTE at our Carson City branch. The additional nine FTE includes additions to staff to support branch and lending activities as well as additional administrative personnel. Bonus expense is mostly a function of pretax income; the increase during the 2018 period is primarily related to the increase in pretax income and expansion in 2018 in the bonus plan to include nonofficer level personnel. These items were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $731 thousand to $2.5 million related mostly to an increase in loan origination activity.\nProfessional fees increased by $313 thousand related primarily to an $139 thousand increase in consulting expense and a $132 thousand increase in legal expense. The increase in other non-interest expense included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments, an increase of $63 thousand in charge offs on over drafted deposit accounts and an accrual for costs associated with the termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. These three items accounted for approximately 70% of the $352 thousand increase in Other expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $5.9 million, or 27.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2019. This compares to an income tax provision of $5.1 million, or 26.8% of pre-tax income during 2018. The percentages for 2019 and 2018 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal loan and securities interest decrease taxable income. In addition, the 2019 and 2018 provision include income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options of $41 thousand and $134 thousand, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \"More likely than not\" is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.\nFinancial Condition\nLoan Portfolio. Gross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million. The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.\nAs shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, agricultural loans and commercial loans.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> End of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> End of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction & land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>619,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 72% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, and Sierra and in Washoe and Carson City Counties in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.\nThe rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 74% and 75%, respectively of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate totaled approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, 32% and 33%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate. While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types. The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 14.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019. The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate. In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans. Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans. The Company's agricultural loan balances totaled $79 million at December 31, 2019 and $69 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,084 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agriculture (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>566,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>486,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,243 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,958 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,549 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,078 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>616,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>562,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>456,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes equity lines of credit and auto\n(2) Includes agriculture real estate\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2019.

The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company's credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company's management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans monthly and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans. MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO. MARC consists of the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower's financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower's management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.\nFormula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Loss factors are based on the Company's historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.\nThe discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. We have purchased software to support the CECL calculation of the allowance for loan losses under ASU No 2016-13 and have engaged the software vendor to assist in the transition to the CECL model. The Company's preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses. However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of the potential impact. On October 16, 2019, the FASB approved a proposal to change the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies, as defined by the SEC, and other non-SEC reporting entities delaying the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. As the Company is a smaller reporting company and has not adopted provisions of the standard early, the delay is applicable to the Company.\nThe following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company's allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December

Net charge-offs totaled $1,215 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2019 up $504 thousand from $711 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. The largest component of this increase was an increase of $262 thousand in charge-offs on commercial loans which mostly relates to charge-offs on the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased from 0.14% during 2018 to 0.21% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> End of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate construction & land\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer (includes equity lines of credit & auto)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $7.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $7.0 million at December 31, 2018. Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $27 thousand from $181 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $154 thousand at December 31, 2019. At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion. General reserves were $7.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $6.8 million at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.17% at December 31, 2019. The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.15% at December 31, 2019 and 1.20% at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.\nImpaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section. The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nA restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.\nLoans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $0.9 million, $1.0 million, $1.1 million, $2.6 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 up from $2.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nA substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Total substandard loans increased by $2.6 million from $741 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $3.3 million at December 31, 2019. Loans classified as special mention increased by $3.3 million from $4.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $7.6 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, $1.4 million of performing loans were classified as substandard. Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $2.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $154 thousand and $181 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, $71 thousand and $11 thousand had been charged off against impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. OREO holdings represented three properties totaling $707 thousand at December 31, 2019 and six properties totaling $1.2 million at December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.33% at December 31, 2019 and 0.28% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, dollars in thousands:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dispositions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(675 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision from change in OREO valuation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio and Federal Reserve Balances.

Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each Category\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> to Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> to Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money Market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>726,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. To assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> Remaining Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three months to six months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over six months to 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,868 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTime deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company's local business and individual customer base. The potential impact on the Company's liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company's asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.\nShort-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company held $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets. Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2019, the Company can borrow up to $130 million. To borrow the $229 million in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2.7 million in additional FHLB stock. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB or the correspondent banks under these agreements at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNote Payable On October 1, 2019 the Company renewed its line of credit, for a one-year term, with the same lender (the Note\u201d). The maximum amount outstanding at any one time on the Note cannot exceed $5 million. There were no borrowings on the Note during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Note bears interest at a rate of the U.S. \"Prime Rate\" plus one-quarter percent per annum and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company's 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank. Under the Note, the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios. The Bank was in compliance with all such covenants related to the Note at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nRepurchase Agreements. In 2011 the Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling $16.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $13.1 million at December 31, 2018 are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with a carrying amount of $22.0 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank's premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are business trust subsidiaries formed by the Company with capital of $349 thousand and $179 thousand, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.\nDuring 2002, Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities (\"Trust Preferred Securities\"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000. During 2005, Trust II issued 4,000 Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $4,000,000. The entire proceeds were invested by Trust I in the amount of $6,186,000 and Trust II in the amount of $4,124,000 in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the \"Subordinated Debentures\") issued by the Company, with identical maturity, repricing and payment terms as the Trust Preferred Securities. The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.\nTrust I's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 5.35% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. Trust II's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 3.37% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%. The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%. Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.\nInterest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 related to the subordinated debentures was $531,000, $510,000 and $401,000, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. Stock option activity increased shareholders' equity by $0.4 million. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nIt is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. The Board of Directors believes that such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company's stock. All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board periodically, but on no regular schedule, reviews the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by California and federal law and the policies and regulations of the FRB as well as restrictions the Subordinated Debentures.\nOn October 20, 2016 the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend. The dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share was paid on November 21, 2016. A semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.14 per share was paid on May 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017, a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.18 per share was paid on May 15, 2018 and November 15, 2018, and a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.23 per share was paid on May 15, 2019 and November 15, 2019 representing a 130% increase over the dividend paid on November 21, 2016.\nCapital Standards. The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\nIn July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III,\u201d that increased the minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks and implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The Basel III capital rules include a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized\u201d include a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the Basel III capital rules require that banking organizations maintain an a capital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the Basel III capital rules require the following minimum ratios for a bank holding company or bank to be considered well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2019, the Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceed the thresholds necessary to be considered well capitalized\u201d under the Basel III framework.\nUnder the FRB's Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding company Policy Statement (the Policy Statement\u201d), qualifying bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to the Basel III consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. The new capital rules continue to apply to the Bank.\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio\u201d (the ratio of a bank's tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) that qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion in assets may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. A qualifying banking organization that elects to use new ratio will be considered to have met all applicable federal regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized, \u201d if it maintains community bank leverage ratio capital exceeding 9%. The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Our management is evaluating the new ratio but has not made a decision as to whether we will adopt it.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Minimum Amount of Capital Required\n</td> <td>

Bank met all its capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company policy is to maintain the Bank's ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments and $126 thousand in letters of credit. This compares to $126.9 million in unfunded loan commitments and $417 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2018. Of the $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments, $65.4 million and $46.0 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2019, $57.3 million were secured by real estate, of which $21.2 million was secured by commercial real estate and $36.1 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOperating Leases. The Company leases three depository branches, three lending offices, two administrative offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations. Including variable lease expense, total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2018 and 2017 were $465,000, $379,000 and $348,000, respectively. The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2020 and the last such lease expiring on December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements. The Company's liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the FHLB or the correspondent bank borrowing lines at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nCustomer deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company's securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company's available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and gains from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California and Northern Nevada, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California and Northern Nevada, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million or 11% over net income of $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Pretax income increased by $2.3 million, or 12%, to $21.4 million in 2019 from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet interest income increased by $4.5 million to $37.6 million during 2019 from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $5.0 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $511 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on other interest earning assets increased by $22 thousand. The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million during 2019,up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the $8.9 million earned during 2018. The largest component of the decrease in non-interest income was a $1.0 million decline in the gain on sale of SBA loans. Non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand to $22.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The largest component of the increase in non-interest expense was an increase in salary and benefit expense of $871 thousand.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $734 thousand from $5.1 million in 2018 to $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $865 million, an increase of $41 million from $824 million at December 31, 2018. This increase included increases of $53.5 million in loans, $342 thousand in premises and equipment, $328 thousand in bank owned life insurance and $256 thousand in cash. These items were partially offset by decreases of $12.2 million in investment securities, $463 thousand in OREO and $1.0 million in other assets.\nGross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million.\nTotal deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe $20.8 million increase in deposits includes increases of $27.6 million in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, $8.1 million in money market accounts and $6.2 million in savings accounts.These items were partially offset by declines of $2.3 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $18.8 million in time deposits.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nThe return on average assets was 1.82% for 2019, down slightly from 1.83% for 2018. The return on average equity was 20.2% for 2019, down from 23.3% for 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. Average balances are based on average daily balances. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

on a tax-equivalent basis. (2) Average nonaccrual loan balances of $2.0 million for 2019, $1.0 million for 2018 and $3.2 million for 2017 are included in average loan balances for computational purposes. (3) Loan origination fees and costs are included in interest income as adjustments of the loan yields over the life of the loan using the interest method. Loan interest income includes net loan costs of $741,000, $462,000 and $501,000 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. (5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets. \nThe following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years

Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up $4.5 million, or 14%, from $33.1 million during 2018. The $4.5 million included an increase of $5.0 million, or 15%, in interest income, from $34.3 million during 2018 to $39.3 million during the current year and an increase of $511 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on interest-earning bank deposits increased by $22 thousand.\nInterest and fees on loans was $34.3 million during 2019. The average loan balances were $588.8 million for 2019, up $70.2 million from $518.6 million during 2018.

We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 37 basis points. At December 31, 2019 approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand as a result of an increase in average balance of $18.1 million from $153.0 million in 2018 to $171.1 million in 2019. Yield on investment securities declined slightly from 2.58% during 2018 to 2.57% in 2019. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $632 thousand in 2019 and $610 thousand in 2018, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $22 thousand increase in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to an increase in the average rate paid on interest earning deposits of 20 basis points from 1.85% during 2018 to 2.05% in 2019 which is consistent with the average federal funds rate during this period. The effect of the increase in yield was mostly offset by a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $2.0 million from $32.9 million during 2018 to $30.9 million in 2019.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $485 thousand from $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, to $1,201 thousand during 2019. This increase mostly relates to an increase in interest expense on money market accounts and time deposits related to the purchase of our Carson City, Nevada branch on October 26, 2018. The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which Plumas Bank pays in other markets. To date we have maintained the rates on the money market accounts at this branch but have experienced a decrease in deposits mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 money market accounts housed at our Carson City branch averaged $14.9 million and time deposits at this branch averaged $11.2 million. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $277 thousand to $411 thousand related to an increase in average rate paid of 28 basis points and an increase in average balances of $17.3 million from $69.4 million during 2018 to $86.7 million during 2019. Interest on time deposits increased by $197 thousand from $192 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $389 thousand during 2019. During this same period average time deposits increased by $4.1 million and the average rate paid on time deposit increased by 37 basis points.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $26 thousand from $520 thousand during 2018 to $546 thousand during the current period mostly related to an increase in rate paid on junior subordinated debentures. Interest on the debentures, which totaled $531 thousand during 2019 and $510 thousand during 2018, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nNet interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2019 increased to 4.75%, from 4.70% during 2018.\n2018 compared to 2017. Net interest income was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, up $5.2 million, or 18%, from $27.9 million during 2017. The $5.2 million included an increase of $5.4 million, or 18.5%, in interest income, from $28.9 million during 2017 to $34.3 million during 2018 and an increase of $219 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.0 million and interest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million. Interest on deposits decreased by $64 thousand. The increases in interest on loans and investments include both an increase in average balance and an increase in average yield.\nInterest and fees on loans was $29.8 million during 2018. The average loan balances were $518.6 million for 2018, up $46.9 million from the $471.7 million during 2017.\nThe average yield on loans was 5.74% for 2018 up 27 basis points from 5.47% for 2017. We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 81 basis points. At December 31, 2018 approximately 28% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million as a result of an increase in yield of 41 basis points from 2.17% during 2017 to 2.58% during 2018 and an increase in average balance from $114.5 million in 2017 to $153.0 million in 2018. During the current period yield benefited from market conditions and the maturity, sales and payments on lower earning securities. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $610 thousand in 2018 and $674 thousand in 2017, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $64 thousand decrease in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $23.6 million from $56.5 million during 2017 to $32.9 million in 2018. The decrease in average balance was mostly offset by an increase in yield of 66 basis points from 119 basis points in 2017 to 185 basis points in 2018; consistent with the increase in the average fed funds rate during these periods.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $134 thousand to $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $582 thousand in 2017. Of this increase, $81 thousand relates to interest at our Carson City branch. The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which the Bank pays in other markets and we would expect some runoff on these accounts as they reprice over time. Interest expense on NOW accounts increased by $7 thousand. Rates paid on NOW accounts averaged 0.09% during 2018 and 2017. Average balances increased by $6.6 million to $103.5 million during 2018 from $96.9 million during 2017. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $50 thousand to $134 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. Rates paid on money market accounts averaged 0.19% during 2018 and 0.14% in 2017. The increase is primarily related to higher cost money market accounts at the Carson City branch. Average balances increased by $10.8 million from $58.6 million in 2017 to $69.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Much of this increase is associated with the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $30 thousand as we continued to experience growth in this category of deposits. Average savings deposits increased by $17.1 million from $159.7 million during 2017 to $176.8 million during 2018. The average rate paid on savings accounts was 17 basis points in 2018 and 2017.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $47 thousand from $145 thousand during 2017 to $192 thousand during 2018 primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Carson City branch Average time deposits declined by $2.7 million from $47.4 million during 2017 to $44.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits was 0.43% in 2018 and 0.31% during 2017.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $85 thousand from $435 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $520 thousand during the current twelve-month period. Interest expense on the Company's note payable decreased by $28 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was related to a decrease in average borrowings on this note from $700 thousand during 2017 to $0 in 2018. The note payable was paid off in April of 2017. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $109 thousand to $510 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.\nAs a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2018 increased to 4.70%, from 4.35% during 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to repay their loan. The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.\nThese estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio. However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change during Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interchange revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of loans, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,036 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(136 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings on bank owned life insurance policies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on sale of investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(158 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on equity securities with no readily determinable fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(209 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(746 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The largest component of this decrease was a decline of $1.0 million in gains on sale of SBA loans from $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $867 thousand during 2019. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $19.5 million during 2019 and $41.7 million during 2018. Loans originated for sale totaled $20.4 million during 2019 compared to $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. We attribute some of the decline in originations to the government shutdown during the first quarter of 2019. During the shutdown we were unable to provide SBA guaranteed loans. In addition, higher market rates have resulted in a decrease in demand and competition in the SBA lending market remains intense. Loan servicing income, which decreased by $40 thousand, represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold into the secondary market. At December 31, 2019 we were servicing $116 million in guaranteed portions of loans, a decrease of $6 million from $122 million at December 31, 2018. Non-interest income benefited during the 2018 period from a $209 thousand gain recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities, which in our case consists of stock in our correspondent banks, without a readily determinable fair market value. No gain or loss was recorded on these investment securities during the current period.\nPartially offsetting these declines in non-interest income were increases of $119 thousand in service charge income and $200 thousand in interchange income mostly related to an increase in the size of the bank. Other increases in non-interest income included a $114 thousand gain on sale of investment securities and an increase in dividends on FHLB stock of $77 thousand related to an increase in the dividend rate as well as an increase in holdings of FHLB stock.\n2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $8.9 million, an increase of $601 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Included in this increase were two items of a non-recurring nature. A $209 thousand gain was recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities and the loss on sale of investment securities declined by $150 thousand to $8 thousand in 2018. Other significant increases in non-interest income included $109 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, $187 thousand in interchange income and $69 thousand in loan service fees. We attribute these increases primarily to growth in the bank.\nThe largest decrease in non-interest income was a $136 thousand decline in gains on sale of loans. The decline in gain on sale relates to a decline in the average premium received on sale. Gains on sale of loans mostly relate to sales of SBA 7(a) loans. Gains on sale of loans decreased from $2.0 million during 2017 to $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $41.7 million during 2018 and $36.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Loans originated for sale totaled $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and $31.3 million during 2017. Loan servicing income increased by $69 thousand; at December 31, 2018 we were servicing $122 million in guaranteed portions of loans, an increase of $9 million from $113 million at December 31, 2017.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

During 2019 non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand, or 4% to $22.8 million, up from $21.8 million during 2018. Total non-interest expense related to our Carson City, Nevada branch was $866 thousand during 2019 and $340 thousand during 2018. Excluding the effect of the Carson City branch, non-interest expense would have increased by 2%.\nThe Company's single largest expense is salary and benefit costs. During 2019, salary and benefit expense increased by $871 thousand, or 7%, to $13.0 million. Salary expense increased by $1.0 million related to annual merit and promotion increases, an increase of seven Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employees and a full year of operations of our Carson City, Nevada branch. Other significant increases in salary and benefit expense include a decline of $226 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs and an increase of $114 thousand in medical insurance expense. Partially offsetting these items was a decline of $544 thousand in commission expense consistent with the decline in SBA sales. Other significant increases in non-interest expense include $349 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense, $236 thousand in amortization of core deposit intangible, $176 thousand in director compensation and expense and $157 thousand in outside service fees. The largest decreases in non-interest expense were $228 thousand in gain on sale of OREO properties and reductions in professional fees of $221 thousand, deposit insurance expense of $172 thousand, other non-interest expense of $153 thousand and $115 thousand in the provision for change in OREO valuation.\nOf the $349 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment costs, $139 thousand relates to the Carson City, Nevada branch. Of the remaining increase the three largest items were increases of $74 thousand in equipment depreciation, $74 thousand in software costs and $38 thousand in rent expense. The increase in amortization of core deposit intangible is related to the amortization of the core deposit intangible recorded on the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Director compensation and expense was abnormally low during the 2018 period as it included the reversal of accrued retirement costs related to our former director John Flournoy who elected not to run for reelection in 2018 and instead allowed his board term to expire as of May 16, 2018. Mr. Flournoy did not meet the minimum years of service required under his agreement to receive benefits. In addition, during 2019 we have added two new Board members. The increase in outside services primarily relates to growth in the Bank.\nProfessional fees during the current period benefited from a reduction in consulting costs of $109 thousand and corporate legal costs of $127 thousand. Consulting costs were somewhat high during the 2018 period as they included an external review of our compliance management system and $29 thousand related to our acquisition of the Carson City, Nevada branch. Legal fees during the 2018 period included $44 thousand related to the Carson City branch acquisition and $45 associated with litigation brought by a third-party municipality against one of our borrowers which could adversely affect our collateral position. Deposit insurance costs during the current period benefited from assessment credits we were able to apply to our deposit insurance billings. Plumas Bank was awarded assessment credits totaling $177 thousand which became available once the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached at least 1.38. During the third quarter we were notified that the reserve ratio was 1.40 on June 30, 2019 and that our credits would be available to offset insurance assessments beginning with the April 1, 2019 assessment period. Other non-interest expense during the 2018 period was also higher than normal as it included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments and costs associated with the pending termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. During 2018 we purchased a building in Tahoe City which, after remodeling is complete, will become the new home of our Tahoe City branch. Our lease obligation at our current location includes a termination penalty that during 2018 has been accrued into other expense. During 2019 we sold three OREO properties recording a net gain on sale of $275 thousand.\n2018 compared to 2017. Non-interest expense increased by $1.7 million to $21.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $20.1 million during 2017. The three largest components of this increase were increases of $633 thousand in salaries and benefits, $313 thousand in professional fees and $352 thousand in Other. The largest components of the increase in salary and benefit expense were increases of $762 thousand in salary expense and $386 thousand in bonus expense. Salary expense increased to $9.5 million related to additions to staff and merit and promotion increases. Total FTE increased from 142 at December 31, 2017 to 155 at December 31, 2018. This increase includes 4 FTE at our Carson City branch. The additional nine FTE includes additions to staff to support branch and lending activities as well as additional administrative personnel. Bonus expense is mostly a function of pretax income; the increase during the 2018 period is primarily related to the increase in pretax income and expansion in 2018 in the bonus plan to include nonofficer level personnel. These items were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $731 thousand to $2.5 million related mostly to an increase in loan origination activity.\nProfessional fees increased by $313 thousand related primarily to an $139 thousand increase in consulting expense and a $132 thousand increase in legal expense. The increase in other non-interest expense included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments, an increase of $63 thousand in charge offs on over drafted deposit accounts and an accrual for costs associated with the termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. These three items accounted for approximately 70% of the $352 thousand increase in Other expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $5.9 million, or 27.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2019. This compares to an income tax provision of $5.1 million, or 26.8% of pre-tax income during 2018. The percentages for 2019 and 2018 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal loan and securities interest decrease taxable income. In addition, the 2019 and 2018 provision include income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options of $41 thousand and $134 thousand, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \"More likely than not\" is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.\nFinancial Condition\nLoan Portfolio. Gross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million. The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.\nAs shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, agricultural loans and commercial loans.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Loans in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> End of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> End of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Category to\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Loans\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - residential\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction & land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity Lines of Credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Auto\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>619,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>566,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 72% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, and Sierra and in Washoe and Carson City Counties in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.\nThe rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 74% and 75%, respectively of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate totaled approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, 32% and 33%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate. While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types. The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 14.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019. The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate. In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans. Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans. The Company's agricultural loan balances totaled $79 million at December 31, 2019 and $69 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate - construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,084 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,274 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agriculture (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>566,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>486,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>461,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,243 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,958 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,669 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,549 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,078 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>616,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>562,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>482,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>456,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>396,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes equity lines of credit and auto\n(2) Includes agriculture real estate\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2019.

The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company's credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company's management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans monthly and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans. MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO. MARC consists of the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower's financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower's management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.\nFormula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Loss factors are based on the Company's historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.\nThe discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. We have purchased software to support the CECL calculation of the allowance for loan losses under ASU No 2016-13 and have engaged the software vendor to assist in the transition to the CECL model. The Company's preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses. However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of the potential impact. On October 16, 2019, the FASB approved a proposal to change the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies, as defined by the SEC, and other non-SEC reporting entities delaying the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. As the Company is a smaller reporting company and has not adopted provisions of the standard early, the delay is applicable to the Company.\nThe following table provides certain information for the

Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $27 thousand from $181 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $154 thousand at December 31, 2019. At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion. General reserves were $7.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $6.8 million at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.17% at December 31, 2019. The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.15% at December 31, 2019 and 1.20% at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.\nImpaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section. The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nA restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.\nLoans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $0.9 million, $1.0 million, $1.1 million, $2.6 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 5 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThe following table sets forth the amount of the Company's nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,546 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,546 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other vehicles owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,332 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income forgone on nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income recorded on a cash basis on nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming loans to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Nonperforming assets to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNonperforming loans at December 31, 2019 were $2.1 million, an increase of $933 thousand from the $1.1 million balance at December 31, 2018. Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $121 thousand at December 31, 2019 and $128 thousand at December 31, 2018, respectively. Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 up from $2.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nA substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Total substandard loans increased by $2.6 million from $741 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $3.3 million at December 31, 2019. Loans classified as special mention increased by $3.3 million from $4.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $7.6 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, $1.4 million of performing loans were classified as substandard. Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $2.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $154 thousand and $181 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, $71 thousand and $11 thousand had been charged off against impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. OREO holdings represented three properties totaling $707 thousand at December 31, 2019 and six properties totaling $1.2 million at December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.33% at December 31, 2019 and 0.28% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, dollars in thousands:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Additions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dispositions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(675 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision from change in OREO valuation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Portfolio and Federal Reserve Balances. Total investment securities were $159.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and $171.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2.9 million were recorded, net of $861 thousand in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2.9 million were recorded, net of $846 thousand in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company sold fifty-five available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $19.7 million recording a $114 thousand gain on sale. During 2018 the Company sold eighteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $4.2 million recording an $8 thousand loss on sale.\nThe investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 consisted of $125.7 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 89 municipal securities totaling $33.6 million. The investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 consisted of $132.7 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 119 municipal securities totaling $38.8 million.\nThere were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $20.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $19.9 million at December 31, 2018. The balance, at December 31, 2019, earned interest at the rate of 1.55%.\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.\nThe following tables summarize the values of the Company's investment securities held on the dates indicated:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale (fair value)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government-sponsored agency residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,678 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,788 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,678 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company's securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2019.

Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Each Category\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> to Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Balance at End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> to Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> of Period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/31/2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>331,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOW\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money Market\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Savings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>726,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. To assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> Remaining Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three months to six months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over six months to 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,868 </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTime deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company's local business and individual customer base. The potential impact on the Company's liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company's asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.\nShort-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company held $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets. Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2019, the Company can borrow up to $130 million. To borrow the $229 million in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2.7 million in additional FHLB stock. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB or the correspondent banks under these agreements at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNote Payable On October 1, 2019 the Company renewed its line of credit, for a one-year term, with the same lender (the Note\u201d). The maximum amount outstanding at any one time on the Note cannot exceed $5 million. There were no borrowings on the Note during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Note bears interest at a rate of the U.S. \"Prime Rate\" plus one-quarter percent per annum and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company's 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank. Under the Note, the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios. The Bank was in compliance with all such covenants related to the Note at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nRepurchase Agreements. In 2011 the Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling $16.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $13.1 million at December 31, 2018 are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with a carrying amount of $22.0 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank's premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are business trust subsidiaries formed by the Company with capital of $349 thousand and $179 thousand, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.\nDuring 2002, Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities (\"Trust Preferred Securities\"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000. During 2005, Trust II issued 4,000 Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $4,000,000. The entire proceeds were invested by Trust I in the amount of $6,186,000 and Trust II in the amount of $4,124,000 in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the \"Subordinated Debentures\") issued by the Company, with identical maturity, repricing and payment terms as the Trust Preferred Securities. The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.\nTrust I's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 5.35% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. Trust II's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 3.37% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%. The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%. Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.\nInterest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 related to the subordinated debentures was $531,000, $510,000 and $401,000, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. Stock option activity increased shareholders' equity by $0.4 million. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nIt is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. The Board of Directors believes that such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company's stock. All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board periodically, but on no regular schedule, reviews the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by California and federal law and the policies and regulations of the FRB as well as restrictions the Subordinated Debentures.\nOn October 20, 2016 the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend. The dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share was paid on November 21, 2016. A semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.14 per share was paid on May 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017, a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.18 per share was paid on May 15, 2018 and November 15, 2018, and a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.23 per share was paid on May 15, 2019 and November 15, 2019 representing a 130% increase over the dividend paid on November 21, 2016.\nCapital Standards. The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\nIn July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III,\u201d that increased the minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks and implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The Basel III capital rules include a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized\u201d include a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the Basel III capital rules require that banking organizations maintain an a capital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the Basel III capital rules require the following minimum ratios for a bank holding company or bank to be considered well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2019, the Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceed the thresholds necessary to be considered well capitalized\u201d under the Basel III framework.\nUnder the FRB's Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding company Policy Statement (the Policy Statement\u201d), qualifying bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to the Basel III consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. The new capital rules continue to apply to the Bank.\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio\u201d (the ratio of a bank's tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) that qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion in assets may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. A qualifying banking organization that elects to use new ratio will be considered to have met all applicable federal regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized, \u201d if it maintains community bank leverage ratio capital exceeding 9%. The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Our management is evaluating the new ratio but has not made a decision as to whether we will adopt it.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Minimum Amount of Capital Required\n</td> <td>

Bank met all its capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company policy is to maintain the Bank's ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments and $126 thousand in letters of credit. This compares to $126.9 million in unfunded loan commitments and $417 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2018. Of the $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments, $65.4 million and $46.0 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2019, $57.3 million were secured by real estate, of which $21.2 million was secured by commercial real estate and $36.1 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOperating Leases. The Company leases three depository branches, three lending offices, two administrative offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations. Including variable lease expense, total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2018 and 2017 were $465,000, $379,000 and $348,000, respectively. The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2020 and the last such lease expiring on December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements. The Company's liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the FHLB or the correspondent bank borrowing lines at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nCustomer deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company's securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company's available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company for Plumas Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank. We derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related, commercial, automobile and consumer loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and gains from the sale of government guaranteed loans. Our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We rely on locally-generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans.\nWe are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results, like those of other financial institutions operating in California and Northern Nevada, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in California and Northern Nevada, including the strength of the real estate market. In addition, both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the Bank's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. Our most complex accounting policies require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. We have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance-sheet date. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nWe evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because it is based upon management's assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans, including current economic conditions, past credit experience, delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans.\nWe cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio, which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital. It pertains to the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe Company recorded net income of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.5 million or 11% over net income of $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Pretax income increased by $2.3 million, or 12%, to $21.4 million in 2019 from $19.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNet interest income increased by $4.5 million to $37.6 million during 2019 from $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $5.0 million partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $511 thousand. Interest on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on other interest earning assets increased by $22 thousand. The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million during 2019,up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the $8.9 million earned during 2018. The largest component of the decrease in non-interest income was a $1.0 million decline in the gain on sale of SBA loans. Non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand to $22.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The largest component of the increase in non-interest expense was an increase in salary and benefit expense of $871 thousand.\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $734 thousand from $5.1 million in 2018 to $5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2019 were $865 million, an increase of $41 million from $824 million at December 31, 2018. This increase included increases of $53.5 million in loans, $342 thousand in premises and equipment, $328 thousand in bank owned life insurance and $256 thousand in cash. These items were partially offset by decreases of $12.2 million in investment securities, $463 thousand in OREO and $1.0 million in other assets.\nGross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million.\nTotal deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe $20.8 million increase in deposits includes increases of $27.6 million in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, $8.1 million in money market accounts and $6.2 million in savings accounts.These items were partially offset by declines of $2.3 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $18.8 million in time deposits.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nThe return on average assets was 1.82% for 2019, down slightly from 1.83% for 2018. The return on average equity was 20.2% for 2019, down from 23.3% for 2018.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents, for the years indicated, the distribution of consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity. Average balances are based on average daily balances. It also presents the amounts of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant yields expressed in both dollars and yield percentages, as well as the amounts of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant cost expressed in both dollars and rate percentages. Nonaccrual loans are included in the calculation of average loans while nonaccrued interest thereon is excluded from the computation of yields earned:\n\n (1) Interest income is reflected on an actual basis and is not computed on a tax-equivalent basis. (2) Average nonaccrual loan balances of $2.0 million for 2019, $1.0 million for 2018 and $3.2 million for 2017 are included in average loan balances for computational purposes. (3) Loan origination fees and costs are included in interest income as adjustments of the loan yields over the life of the loan using the interest method. Loan interest income includes net loan costs of $741,000, $462,000 and $501,000 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (4) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. (5) Net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets. \nThe following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense, for the years indicated and the amount of change attributable to variances in volume, rates and the combination of volume and rates based on the relative changes of volume and rates:\n\n (1) The volume change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the previous year's rate. \n (2) The rate change in net interest income represents the change in rate multiplied by the previous year's average balance. \n (3) The mix change in net interest income represents the change in average balance multiplied by the change in rate. \n2019 compared to 2018. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest income was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up $4.5 million, or 14%, from $33.1 million during 2018. The $4.5 million included an increase of $5.0 million, or 15%, in interest income, from $34.3 million during 2018 to $39.3 million during the current year and an increase of $511 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.5 million, interest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand and interest on interest-earning bank deposits increased by $22 thousand.\nInterest and fees on loans was $34.3 million during 2019. The average loan balances were $588.8 million for 2019, up $70.2 million from $518.6 million during 2018. The following table compares loan balances by type at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nThe average yield on loans was 5.82% for 2019 up 8 basis points from 5.74% for 2018. We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 37 basis points. At December 31, 2019 approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $444 thousand as a result of an increase in average balance of $18.1 million from $153.0 million in 2018 to $171.1 million in 2019. Yield on investment securities declined slightly from 2.58% during 2018 to 2.57% in 2019. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $632 thousand in 2019 and $610 thousand in 2018, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $22 thousand increase in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to an increase in the average rate paid on interest earning deposits of 20 basis points from 1.85% during 2018 to 2.05% in 2019 which is consistent with the average federal funds rate during this period. The effect of the increase in yield was mostly offset by a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $2.0 million from $32.9 million during 2018 to $30.9 million in 2019.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $485 thousand from $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, to $1,201 thousand during 2019. This increase mostly relates to an increase in interest expense on money market accounts and time deposits related to the purchase of our Carson City, Nevada branch on October 26, 2018. The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which Plumas Bank pays in other markets. To date we have maintained the rates on the money market accounts at this branch but have experienced a decrease in deposits mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 money market accounts housed at our Carson City branch averaged $14.9 million and time deposits at this branch averaged $11.2 million. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $277 thousand to $411 thousand related to an increase in average rate paid of 28 basis points and an increase in average balances of $17.3 million from $69.4 million during 2018 to $86.7 million during 2019. Interest on time deposits increased by $197 thousand from $192 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $389 thousand during 2019. During this same period average time deposits increased by $4.1 million and the average rate paid on time deposit increased by 37 basis points.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $26 thousand from $520 thousand during 2018 to $546 thousand during the current period mostly related to an increase in rate paid on junior subordinated debentures. Interest on the debentures, which totaled $531 thousand during 2019 and $510 thousand during 2018, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nNet interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. As a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2019 increased to 4.75%, from 4.70% during 2018.\n2018 compared to 2017. Net interest income was $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, up $5.2 million, or 18%, from $27.9 million during 2017. The $5.2 million included an increase of $5.4 million, or 18.5%, in interest income, from $28.9 million during 2017 to $34.3 million during 2018 and an increase of $219 thousand in interest expense.\nInterest and fees on loans increased by $4.0 million and interest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million. Interest on deposits decreased by $64 thousand. The increases in interest on loans and investments include both an increase in average balance and an increase in average yield.\nInterest and fees on loans was $29.8 million during 2018. The average loan balances were $518.6 million for 2018, up $46.9 million from the $471.7 million during 2017.\nThe average yield on loans was 5.74% for 2018 up 27 basis points from 5.47% for 2017. We attribute much of the increase in yield to an increase in the average prime rate of 81 basis points. At December 31, 2018 approximately 28% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of loans tied to the prime rate or an equivalent rate.\nInterest on investment securities increased by $1.5 million as a result of an increase in yield of 41 basis points from 2.17% during 2017 to 2.58% during 2018 and an increase in average balance from $114.5 million in 2017 to $153.0 million in 2018. During the current period yield benefited from market conditions and the maturity, sales and payments on lower earning securities. Interest income on interest bearing deposits, which totaled $610 thousand in 2018 and $674 thousand in 2017, primarily relates to interest on cash balances held at the Federal Reserve. The $64 thousand decrease in interest on interest bearing deposits was related to a decrease in average interest earning deposits of $23.6 million from $56.5 million during 2017 to $32.9 million in 2018. The decrease in average balance was mostly offset by an increase in yield of 66 basis points from 119 basis points in 2017 to 185 basis points in 2018; consistent with the increase in the average fed funds rate during these periods.\nInterest expense on deposits increased by $134 thousand to $716 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $582 thousand in 2017. Of this increase, $81 thousand relates to interest at our Carson City branch. The average rate paid on the Carson City money market and time deposits exceeds that which the Bank pays in other markets and we would expect some runoff on these accounts as they reprice over time. Interest expense on NOW accounts increased by $7 thousand. Rates paid on NOW accounts averaged 0.09% during 2018 and 2017. Average balances increased by $6.6 million to $103.5 million during 2018 from $96.9 million during 2017. Interest expense on money market accounts increased by $50 thousand to $134 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. Rates paid on money market accounts averaged 0.19% during 2018 and 0.14% in 2017. The increase is primarily related to higher cost money market accounts at the Carson City branch. Average balances increased by $10.8 million from $58.6 million in 2017 to $69.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Much of this increase is associated with the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Interest expense on savings accounts increased by $30 thousand as we continued to experience growth in this category of deposits. Average savings deposits increased by $17.1 million from $159.7 million during 2017 to $176.8 million during 2018. The average rate paid on savings accounts was 17 basis points in 2018 and 2017.\nInterest expense on time deposits increased $47 thousand from $145 thousand during 2017 to $192 thousand during 2018 primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Carson City branch Average time deposits declined by $2.7 million from $47.4 million during 2017 to $44.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The average rate paid on time deposits was 0.43% in 2018 and 0.31% during 2017.\nInterest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased by $85 thousand from $435 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $520 thousand during the current twelve-month period. Interest expense on the Company's note payable decreased by $28 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was related to a decrease in average borrowings on this note from $700 thousand during 2017 to $0 in 2018. The note payable was paid off in April of 2017. Interest expense on junior subordinated debentures, which increased by $109 thousand to $510 thousand, fluctuates with changes in the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate.\nAs a result of the changes noted above, the net interest margin for 2018 increased to 4.70%, from 4.35% during 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million up $500 thousand from $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Analysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loans and prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower's ability to repay their loan. The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates.\nThese estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio. However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n2019 compared to 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, non-interest income totaled $8.1 million, a decrease of $746 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The largest component of this decrease was a decline of $1.0 million in gains on sale of SBA loans from $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $867 thousand during 2019. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $19.5 million during 2019 and $41.7 million during 2018. Loans originated for sale totaled $20.4 million during 2019 compared to $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. We attribute some of the decline in originations to the government shutdown during the first quarter of 2019. During the shutdown we were unable to provide SBA guaranteed loans. In addition, higher market rates have resulted in a decrease in demand and competition in the SBA lending market remains intense. Loan servicing income, which decreased by $40 thousand, represents servicing income received on the guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold into the secondary market. At December 31, 2019 we were servicing $116 million in guaranteed portions of loans, a decrease of $6 million from $122 million at December 31, 2018. Non-interest income benefited during the 2018 period from a $209 thousand gain recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities, which in our case consists of stock in our correspondent banks, without a readily determinable fair market value. No gain or loss was recorded on these investment securities during the current period.\nPartially offsetting these declines in non-interest income were increases of $119 thousand in service charge income and $200 thousand in interchange income mostly related to an increase in the size of the bank. Other increases in non-interest income included a $114 thousand gain on sale of investment securities and an increase in dividends on FHLB stock of $77 thousand related to an increase in the dividend rate as well as an increase in holdings of FHLB stock.\n2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $8.9 million, an increase of $601 thousand from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Included in this increase were two items of a non-recurring nature. A $209 thousand gain was recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities and the loss on sale of investment securities declined by $150 thousand to $8 thousand in 2018. Other significant increases in non-interest income included $109 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, $187 thousand in interchange income and $69 thousand in loan service fees. We attribute these increases primarily to growth in the bank.\nThe largest decrease in non-interest income was a $136 thousand decline in gains on sale of loans. The decline in gain on sale relates to a decline in the average premium received on sale. Gains on sale of loans mostly relate to sales of SBA 7(a) loans. Gains on sale of loans decreased from $2.0 million during 2017 to $1.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $41.7 million during 2018 and $36.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Loans originated for sale totaled $38.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and $31.3 million during 2017. Loan servicing income increased by $69 thousand; at December 31, 2018 we were servicing $122 million in guaranteed portions of loans, an increase of $9 million from $113 million at December 31, 2017.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of other non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\n2019 compared to 2018. During 2019 non-interest expense increased by $969 thousand, or 4% to $22.8 million, up from $21.8 million during 2018. Total non-interest expense related to our Carson City, Nevada branch was $866 thousand during 2019 and $340 thousand during 2018. Excluding the effect of the Carson City branch, non-interest expense would have increased by 2%.\nThe Company's single largest expense is salary and benefit costs. During 2019, salary and benefit expense increased by $871 thousand, or 7%, to $13.0 million. Salary expense increased by $1.0 million related to annual merit and promotion increases, an increase of seven Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employees and a full year of operations of our Carson City, Nevada branch. Other significant increases in salary and benefit expense include a decline of $226 thousand in the deferral of loan origination costs and an increase of $114 thousand in medical insurance expense. Partially offsetting these items was a decline of $544 thousand in commission expense consistent with the decline in SBA sales. Other significant increases in non-interest expense include $349 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense, $236 thousand in amortization of core deposit intangible, $176 thousand in director compensation and expense and $157 thousand in outside service fees. The largest decreases in non-interest expense were $228 thousand in gain on sale of OREO properties and reductions in professional fees of $221 thousand, deposit insurance expense of $172 thousand, other non-interest expense of $153 thousand and $115 thousand in the provision for change in OREO valuation.\nOf the $349 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment costs, $139 thousand relates to the Carson City, Nevada branch. Of the remaining increase the three largest items were increases of $74 thousand in equipment depreciation, $74 thousand in software costs and $38 thousand in rent expense. The increase in amortization of core deposit intangible is related to the amortization of the core deposit intangible recorded on the acquisition of the Carson City branch. Director compensation and expense was abnormally low during the 2018 period as it included the reversal of accrued retirement costs related to our former director John Flournoy who elected not to run for reelection in 2018 and instead allowed his board term to expire as of May 16, 2018. Mr. Flournoy did not meet the minimum years of service required under his agreement to receive benefits. In addition, during 2019 we have added two new Board members. The increase in outside services primarily relates to growth in the Bank.\nProfessional fees during the current period benefited from a reduction in consulting costs of $109 thousand and corporate legal costs of $127 thousand. Consulting costs were somewhat high during the 2018 period as they included an external review of our compliance management system and $29 thousand related to our acquisition of the Carson City, Nevada branch. Legal fees during the 2018 period included $44 thousand related to the Carson City branch acquisition and $45 associated with litigation brought by a third-party municipality against one of our borrowers which could adversely affect our collateral position. Deposit insurance costs during the current period benefited from assessment credits we were able to apply to our deposit insurance billings. Plumas Bank was awarded assessment credits totaling $177 thousand which became available once the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached at least 1.38. During the third quarter we were notified that the reserve ratio was 1.40 on June 30, 2019 and that our credits would be available to offset insurance assessments beginning with the April 1, 2019 assessment period. Other non-interest expense during the 2018 period was also higher than normal as it included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments and costs associated with the pending termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. During 2018 we purchased a building in Tahoe City which, after remodeling is complete, will become the new home of our Tahoe City branch. Our lease obligation at our current location includes a termination penalty that during 2018 has been accrued into other expense. During 2019 we sold three OREO properties recording a net gain on sale of $275 thousand.\n2018 compared to 2017. Non-interest expense increased by $1.7 million to $21.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, up from $20.1 million during 2017. The three largest components of this increase were increases of $633 thousand in salaries and benefits, $313 thousand in professional fees and $352 thousand in Other. The largest components of the increase in salary and benefit expense were increases of $762 thousand in salary expense and $386 thousand in bonus expense. Salary expense increased to $9.5 million related to additions to staff and merit and promotion increases. Total FTE increased from 142 at December 31, 2017 to 155 at December 31, 2018. This increase includes 4 FTE at our Carson City branch. The additional nine FTE includes additions to staff to support branch and lending activities as well as additional administrative personnel. Bonus expense is mostly a function of pretax income; the increase during the 2018 period is primarily related to the increase in pretax income and expansion in 2018 in the bonus plan to include nonofficer level personnel. These items were partially offset by an increase in the deferral of loan origination costs of $731 thousand to $2.5 million related mostly to an increase in loan origination activity.\nProfessional fees increased by $313 thousand related primarily to an $139 thousand increase in consulting expense and a $132 thousand increase in legal expense. The increase in other non-interest expense included a $50 thousand increase in the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments, an increase of $63 thousand in charge offs on over drafted deposit accounts and an accrual for costs associated with the termination of our lease at our Tahoe City, California branch. These three items accounted for approximately 70% of the $352 thousand increase in Other expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $5.9 million, or 27.4% of pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2019. This compares to an income tax provision of $5.1 million, or 26.8% of pre-tax income during 2018. The percentages for 2019 and 2018 differ from statutory rates as tax exempt items of income such as earnings on Bank owned life insurance and municipal loan and securities interest decrease taxable income. In addition, the 2019 and 2018 provision include income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options of $41 thousand and $134 thousand, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \"More likely than not\" is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Based upon the analysis of available evidence, management has determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that all deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded.\nFinancial Condition\nLoan Portfolio. Gross loans increased by $53.5 million, or 9%, from $566 million at December 31, 2018 to $620 million at December 31, 2019. The three largest areas of growth in the Company's loan portfolio were $45 million in commercial real estate loans, $13 million in auto loans and $10 million in agricultural loans. These items were partially offset by declines in other loan categories of $15 million, the largest of which was a decline in construction loans of $9.0 million. The Company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves. Although the Company offers a broad array of financing options, it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses. These loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses, thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts, but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment.\nAs shown in the following table the Company's largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans, auto loans, agricultural loans and commercial loans.\n\nThe Company's real estate related loans, including real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land development loans, consumer equity lines of credit, and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised 72% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Moreover, the business activities of the Company currently are focused in the California counties of Plumas, Nevada, Placer, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, and Sierra and in Washoe and Carson City Counties in Northern Nevada. Consequently, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of the Company's operations in these areas of Northeastern California and Northwestern Nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in these regions.\nThe rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the Company's lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or U.S. Treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes. The frequency in which variable rate loans reprice can vary from one day to several years. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 74% and 75%, respectively of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans. Loans indexed to the prime interest rate totaled approximately 25% of the Company's loan portfolio; these loans reprice within one day to three months of a change in the prime rate. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, 32% and 33%, respectively of the variable loans were at their respective floor rate. While real estate mortgage, commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the Company's historical loan mix, some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types. The most significant change has been an increase in indirect auto lending with automobile loans increasing from 2.5% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 to 14.6% of gross loans at December 31, 2019. The automobile portfolio provides diversification to the loan portfolio in terms of rate, term and balance as these loans tend to have a much shorter term and balance than commercial real-estate loans and are fixed rate. In addition, the Company remains committed to the agricultural industry and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans. Agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans. The Company's agricultural loan balances totaled $79 million at December 31, 2019 and $69 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated.\n\n(1) Includes equity lines of credit and auto\n(2) Includes agriculture real estate\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of gross loan categories as of December 31, 2019. Also provided with respect to such loans are the amounts due after one year, classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates:\n\nAnalysis of Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company's credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company's management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Management Asset Resolution Committee (MARC) reviews the asset quality of criticized and past due loans monthly and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system helps facilitate the early identification of potential criticized loans. MARC also provides guidance for the maintenance and timely disposition of OREO properties including developing financing and marketing programs to incent individuals to purchase OREO. MARC consists of the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and the activities are governed by a formal written charter. The MARC meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of loans including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing allowance for loan losses, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The collectability of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower's financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower's management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy.\nFormula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Loss factors are based on the Company's historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Historical loss data from the beginning of the latest business cycle are incorporated in the loss factors.\nThe discretionary allocation is based upon management's evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren't measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today's incurred loss\u201d approach with an expected loss\u201d model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL\u201d) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. We have purchased software to support the CECL calculation of the allowance for loan losses under ASU No 2016-13 and have engaged the software vendor to assist in the transition to the CECL model. The Company's preliminary evaluation indicates the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, in particular the level of the reserve for credit losses. However, the Company continues to evaluate the extent of the potential impact. On October 16, 2019, the FASB approved a proposal to change the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for smaller reporting companies, as defined by the SEC, and other non-SEC reporting entities delaying the effective date to fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. As the Company is a smaller reporting company and has not adopted provisions of the standard early, the delay is applicable to the Company.\nThe following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company's allowance for loan losses as well as charge-off and recovery activity.\n\n(1) Includes equity lines of credit and auto\n(2) Includes agriculture real estate\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.5 million and $1 million, respectively. Net charge-offs totaled $1,215 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2019 up $504 thousand from $711 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. The largest component of this increase was an increase of $262 thousand in charge-offs on commercial loans which mostly relates to charge-offs on the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased from 0.14% during 2018 to 0.21% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses:\n\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $7.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $7.0 million at December 31, 2018. Specific reserves related to impaired loans decreased by $27 thousand from $181 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $154 thousand at December 31, 2019. At least quarterly the Company evaluates each specific reserve and if it determines that the loss represented by the specific reserve is uncollectable it records a charge-off for the uncollectable portion. General reserves were $7.1 million at December 31, 2019 and $6.8 million at December 31, 2018. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.23% at December 31, 2018 to 1.17% at December 31, 2019. The percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans totaled 1.15% at December 31, 2019 and 1.20% at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company places loans 90 days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. A loan is considered to be in the process of collection if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current. Generally, this collection period would not exceed 90 days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the Company's general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received, and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable. Where the collectability of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management, it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming 90 days delinquent.\nImpaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section. The primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans 90 days or more past due, restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us (including both principal and interest) in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement.\nA restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.\nLoans restructured (TDRs) and not included in nonperforming loans in the following table totaled $0.9 million, $1.0 million, $1.1 million, $2.6 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. For additional information related to restructured loans see Note 5 of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThe following table sets forth the amount of the Company's nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated.\n\nNonperforming loans at December 31, 2019 were $2.1 million, an increase of $933 thousand from the $1.1 million balance at December 31, 2018. Specific reserves on nonaccrual loans totaled $121 thousand at December 31, 2019 and $128 thousand at December 31, 2018, respectively. Performing loans past due thirty to eighty-nine days were $3.7 million at December 31, 2019 up from $2.6 million at December 31, 2018.\nA substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value of the collateral pledged, if any. Total substandard loans increased by $2.6 million from $741 thousand at December 31, 2018 to $3.3 million at December 31, 2019. Loans classified as special mention increased by $3.3 million from $4.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $7.6 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, $1.4 million of performing loans were classified as substandard. Further deterioration in the credit quality of individual performing substandard loans or other adverse circumstances could result in the need to place these loans on nonperforming status.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's recorded investment in impaired loans totaled $2.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans totaled $154 thousand and $181 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, $71 thousand and $11 thousand had been charged off against impaired loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOREO represents real property acquired by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. OREO holdings represented three properties totaling $707 thousand at December 31, 2019 and six properties totaling $1.2 million at December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.33% at December 31, 2019 and 0.28% at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in the number and balance of OREO properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, dollars in thousands:\n\nInvestment Portfolio and Federal Reserve Balances. Total investment securities were $159.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and $171.5 million as of December 31, 2018. Unrealized gains on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2.9 million were recorded, net of $861 thousand in tax expense, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaling $2.9 million were recorded, net of $846 thousand in tax benefits, as accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity at December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company sold fifty-five available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $19.7 million recording a $114 thousand gain on sale. During 2018 the Company sold eighteen available-for-sale investment securities for total proceeds of $4.2 million recording an $8 thousand loss on sale.\nThe investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 consisted of $125.7 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 89 municipal securities totaling $33.6 million. The investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 consisted of $132.7 million in securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies and 119 municipal securities totaling $38.8 million.\nThere were no Federal funds sold at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018; however, the Bank maintained interest earning balances at the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $20.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $19.9 million at December 31, 2018. The balance, at December 31, 2019, earned interest at the rate of 1.55%.\nThe Company classifies its investment securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Currently all securities are classified as available-for-sale. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold to implement the Company's asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors.\nThe following tables summarize the values of the Company's investment securities held on the dates indicated:\n\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company's securities at their carrying value, which represents fair value, and their weighted average tax equivalent yields at December 31, 2019. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.\n\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. On October 26, 2018 we purchased a branch in Carson City, Nevada from Mutual of Omaha Bank. In this transaction we acquired $45.6 million in deposits including $18.5 million in time deposits. We experienced a decrease in deposits at this branch mostly related to the maturity of time deposits which were yielding significantly higher rates than our offering rates. In total, time deposits at the Carson City Branch declined by $14.8 million from $17.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of the decline in time deposits in Carson City, total deposits would have increased by $35.6 million or 5%. At December 31, 2019, 44% of the Company's deposits were in the form of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and only 5% were time deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nThe following table shows the distribution of deposits by type at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nDeposits represent the Bank's primary source of funds. Deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand, savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals. These sources are considered to be relatively stable, long-term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances. The Company experiences, to a small degree, some seasonality with the slower growth period between November through April, and the higher growth period from May through October. To assist in meeting any funding demands, the Company maintains a secured borrowing arrangement with the FHLB. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's time deposits of $100,000 or more had the following schedule of maturities at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n\nTime deposits of $100,000 or more are generally from the Company's local business and individual customer base. The potential impact on the Company's liquidity from the withdrawal of these deposits is discussed at the Company's asset and liability management committee meetings, and is considered to be minimal.\nShort-term Borrowing Arrangements. The Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. The Company is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company held $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively of FHLB stock which is recorded as a component of other assets. Based on this level of stock holdings at December 31, 2019, the Company can borrow up to $130 million. To borrow the $229 million in available credit the Company would need to purchase $2.7 million in additional FHLB stock. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings to the FHLB or the correspondent banks under these agreements at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNote Payable On October 1, 2019 the Company renewed its line of credit, for a one-year term, with the same lender (the Note\u201d). The maximum amount outstanding at any one time on the Note cannot exceed $5 million. There were no borrowings on the Note during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Note bears interest at a rate of the U.S. \"Prime Rate\" plus one-quarter percent per annum and is secured by 100 shares of Plumas Bank stock representing the Company's 100% ownership interest in Plumas Bank. Under the Note, the Bank is subject to several negative and affirmative covenants including, but not limited to providing timely financial information, maintaining specified levels of capital, restrictions on additional borrowings, and meeting or exceeding certain capital and asset quality ratios. The Bank was in compliance with all such covenants related to the Note at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nRepurchase Agreements. In 2011 the Bank introduced a new product for its larger business customers which use securities sold under agreements to repurchase as an alternative to interest-bearing deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling $16.0 million at December 31, 2019 and $13.1 million at December 31, 2018 are secured by U.S. Government agency securities with a carrying amount of $22.0 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest paid on this product is similar to that which is paid on the Bank's premium money market account; however, these are not deposits and are not FDIC insured.\nJunior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. Plumas Statutory Trust I and II are business trust subsidiaries formed by the Company with capital of $349 thousand and $179 thousand, respectively, for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.\nDuring 2002, Trust I issued 6,000 Floating Rate Capital Trust Pass-Through Securities (\"Trust Preferred Securities\"), with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $6,000,000. During 2005, Trust II issued 4,000 Trust Preferred Securities with a liquidation value of $1,000 per security, for gross proceeds of $4,000,000. The entire proceeds were invested by Trust I in the amount of $6,186,000 and Trust II in the amount of $4,124,000 in Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the \"Subordinated Debentures\") issued by the Company, with identical maturity, repricing and payment terms as the Trust Preferred Securities. The Subordinated Debentures represent the sole assets of Trusts I and II.\nTrust I's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 26, 2032, bear a current interest rate of 5.35% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. Trust II's Subordinated Debentures mature on September 28, 2035, bear a current interest rate of 3.37% (based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%), with repricing and payments due quarterly. The interest rate of the Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust I adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.40%. The Trust Preferred Securities issued by Trust II adjust on each quarterly anniversary date to equal the 3-month LIBOR plus 1.48%. Both Trusts I and II have the option to defer payment of the distributions for a period of up to five years, as long as the Company is not in default on the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures.\nInterest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 related to the subordinated debentures was $531,000, $510,000 and $401,000, respectively.\nCapital Resources\nTotal shareholders' equity increased by $17.6 million from $66.9 million at December 31, 2018 to $84.5 million at December 31, 2019. The largest component of the $17.6 million increase was earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $15.5 million. In addition, we recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.1 million from a loss of $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 to income of $2.1 million at December 31, 2019. Stock option activity increased shareholders' equity by $0.4 million. During 2019 the Company paid two 23 cents per share semi-annual cash dividends which had the effect of reducing shareholders' equity by $2.4 million.\nIt is the policy of the Company to periodically distribute excess retained earnings to the shareholders through the payment of cash dividends. The Board of Directors believes that such dividends help promote shareholder value and capital adequacy by enhancing the marketability of the Company's stock. All authority to provide a return to the shareholders in the form of a cash or stock dividend or split rests with the Board of Directors. The Board periodically, but on no regular schedule, reviews the appropriateness of a cash dividend payment. The Company's ability to pay dividends is limited by California and federal law and the policies and regulations of the FRB as well as restrictions the Subordinated Debentures.\nOn October 20, 2016 the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a semi-annual cash dividend. The dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share was paid on November 21, 2016. A semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.14 per share was paid on May 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017, a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.18 per share was paid on May 15, 2018 and November 15, 2018, and a semi-annual cash dividend totaling $0.23 per share was paid on May 15, 2019 and November 15, 2019 representing a 130% increase over the dividend paid on November 21, 2016.\nCapital Standards. The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy. Management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines. The FDIC has promulgated risk-based capital guidelines for all state non-member banks such as the Bank. These guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\nIn July, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks, sometimes called Basel III,\u201d that increased the minimum regulatory capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks and implemented strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The Basel III capital rules include a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized\u201d include a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. In addition, the Basel III capital rules require that banking organizations maintain an a capital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or pay discretionary bonuses. Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the Basel III capital rules require the following minimum ratios for a bank holding company or bank to be considered well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2019, the Company's and the Bank's capital ratios exceed the thresholds necessary to be considered well capitalized\u201d under the Basel III framework.\nUnder the FRB's Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding company Policy Statement (the Policy Statement\u201d), qualifying bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from the consolidated capital rules. The Company qualifies for treatment under the Policy Statement and is not currently subject to the Basel III consolidated capital rules at the bank holding company level. The new capital rules continue to apply to the Bank.\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, issued a rule establishing a community bank leverage ratio\u201d (the ratio of a bank's tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) that qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion in assets may elect to use in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. A qualifying banking organization that elects to use new ratio will be considered to have met all applicable federal regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the minimum capital levels required to be considered well capitalized, \u201d if it maintains community bank leverage ratio capital exceeding 9%. The new rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Our management is evaluating the new ratio but has not made a decision as to whether we will adopt it.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n(1) Does not include amounts required to maintain the capital conservation buffer under the new capital rules\nManagement believes that the Bank met all its capital adequacy requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe current and projected capital positions of the Bank and the impact of capital plans and long-term strategies are reviewed regularly by management. The Company policy is to maintain the Bank's ratios above the prescribed well-capitalized ratios at all times.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLoan Commitments. In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Annual review of commercial credit lines, letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments and $126 thousand in letters of credit. This compares to $126.9 million in unfunded loan commitments and $417 thousand in letters of credit at December 31, 2018. Of the $111.4 million in unfunded loan commitments, $65.4 million and $46.0 million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers, respectively. Of the total unfunded commitments at December 31, 2019, $57.3 million were secured by real estate, of which $21.2 million was secured by commercial real estate and $36.1 million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit. The commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit, while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines and overdraft protection lines. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nOperating Leases. The Company leases three depository branches, three lending offices, two administrative offices and two non-branch automated teller machine locations. Including variable lease expense, total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2018 and 2017 were $465,000, $379,000 and $348,000, respectively. The expiration dates of the leases vary, with the first such lease expiring during 2020 and the last such lease expiring on December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity\nThe Company manages its liquidity to provide the ability to generate funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals (both anticipated and unanticipated), fund customers' borrowing needs, satisfy maturity of short-term borrowings and maintain reserve requirements. The Company's liquidity needs are managed using assets or liabilities, or both. On the asset side, in addition to cash and due from banks, the Company maintains an investment portfolio which includes unpledged U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities that are classified as available-for-sale. On the liability side, liquidity needs are managed by charging competitive offering rates on deposit products and the use of established lines of credit.\nThe Company is a member of the FHLB and can borrow up to $229 million from the FHLB secured by commercial and residential mortgage loans with carrying values totaling $367 million. See Short-term Borrowing Arrangements\u201d for additional information on our FHLB borrowing capacity. In addition to its FHLB borrowing line, the Company has unsecured short-term borrowing agreements with three of its correspondent banks in the amounts of $20 million, $11 million and $10 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the FHLB or the correspondent bank borrowing lines at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nCustomer deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. Total deposits increased by $20.8 million from $727 million at December 31, 2018 to $747 million at December 31, 2019. Deposits are held in various forms with varying maturities. The Company's securities portfolio, Federal funds sold, FHLB advances, and cash and due from banks serve as the primary sources of liquidity, providing adequate funding for loans during periods of high loan demand. During periods of decreased lending, funds obtained from the maturing or sale of investments, loan payments, and new deposits are invested in short-term earning assets, such as cash held at the FRB, Federal funds sold and investment securities, to serve as a source of funding for future loan growth. Management believes that the Company's available sources of funds, including borrowings, will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future.", "item_7_tables": "Table 48:
