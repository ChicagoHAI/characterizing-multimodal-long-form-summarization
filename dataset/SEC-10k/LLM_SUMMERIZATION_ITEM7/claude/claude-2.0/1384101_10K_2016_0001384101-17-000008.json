MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is fundamentally improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and machine learning to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward without risky, costly surgery that is often unnecessary.\nThe role of genomic information in medical practice is evolving rapidly and has affected the diagnosis of disease as well as treatment decisions. Over the past decade, molecular diagnostic tests that analyze genomic material from surgical tissue samples have emerged as an important complement to evaluations performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level enables one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the genomic information derived from these samples can help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care.\nWe deploy machine learning methods and RNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer and other diseases. In our thyroid and lung cancer indications, diagnosis can be ambiguous in approximately 15-70% of patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation. Our tests provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions in approximately half of those cases, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money.\nSince our founding in 2008, we have commercialized three genomic tests that we believe are transforming diagnostics: the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC, for thyroid cancer; the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for lung cancer; and the Envisia Genomic Classifier for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. Collectively, we believe these three tests address a $2 billion global market opportunity.\nThe published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. Nearly 30 clinical studies covering our products have been published, including two landmark clinical validation papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and interstitial lung diseases such as IPF as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach.\nWe believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling the company to set new standards in genomic test reimbursement. Our flagship product, the Afirma GEC, is now covered for more than 200 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis and our second commercial product, the Percepta classifier, is the first genomic test to gain Medicare coverage for improved lung cancer screening and diagnosis.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was $18.3 million and $65.1 million, respectively, an increase of 30% and 31% over the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Afirma Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) Reported Volume for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was 6,313 and 23,237, respectively, an increase of 13% and 20% over the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, were $21.9 million and $93.9 million, respectively, an increase of 0% and 13% over the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was ($4.4) million and ($31.4) million, respectively, a 45% and 7% reduction from the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash and cash equivalents was $59.2 million at December 31, 2016.

Approximately 84% of FNAs we receive are for the Afirma solution, which consists of services related to rendering a cytopathology diagnosis, and if the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the GEC is performed. The remaining approximate 16% of FNAs are received from customers performing cytopathology and when the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the FNA is sent to us for the GEC only. The rate at which adoption occurs in these two settings will cause these two percentages to fluctuate over time. Less than 1% of the FNA samples we receive for cytopathology have insufficient cellular material from which to render a cytopathology\ndiagnosis. We only bill the technical component, including slide preparation, for these tests. For results that are benign or suspicious/malignant by cytopathology, we bill for these services when we issue the report to the physician. If the cytopathology result is indeterminate, defined as atypia/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) or suspicious for FN/HCN, we perform the GEC. Historically, approximately 14%-17% of samples we have received for the Afirma solution have yielded indeterminate results by cytopathology. Approximately 5%-10% of the samples for GEC testing have insufficient RNA from which to render a result. The GEC can be reported as Benign, Suspicious or No Result. We bill for the GEC Benign and GEC Suspicious results only. After the GEC is completed, we issue the cytopathology report for the indeterminate results as well as the GEC report, and then bill for both of these tests. We incur costs of collecting and shipping the FNAs and a portion of the costs of performing tests where we cannot ultimately issue a patient report. Because we cannot bill for all samples received, the number of FNAs received does not directly correlate to the total number of patient reports issued and the amount billed.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for Afirma\nRevenue growth depends on both our ability to achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers and to expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider the GEC experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth will increase as more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our accrued revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of Afirma, we increased our sales force over the last several years, along with increasing our marketing efforts. We have hired institutional channel managers to focus on the institutional segment, where accounts generally send us FNAs for the GEC only, and account managers, dedicated to serving existing accounts, thereby freeing up our product specialists to focus on transacting new business. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on an accrual basis when we are able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement at the time delivery is complete. In the first period in which revenue is accrued for a particular payer or test, there generally is a one-time increase in revenue. Until we have contracts with payers or can reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be received, we recognize the related revenue on the cash basis. As we commercialize new products, we will need to be able to make a reasonable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be received from each payer for each new product offering prior to being able to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payers as well as one-time increases in revenue from newly accrued payers are difficult to predict, we expect that our revenue will fluctuate significantly in any given quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2016, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $161.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled $134 million. Of this amount, we recognized revenue of approximately $7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, when cash was received.\nOur average reimbursement per GEC was approximately $2,300 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 as compared with approximately $2,200 for the same period in 2015. The average quarterly reimbursement ranged from $2,100 to $2,300 in 2016 as compared to a range of $2,200 to $2,300 in 2015. The average GEC reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average GEC reimbursement from all payers, whether they are on the cash or an accrual basis, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. We use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over two quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus the average reimbursement per GEC represents the total cash collected to date against GEC tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of GEC tests performed during that same period.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive revenue from previously performed but unpaid tests. Revenue from these tests, if any, may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers and claims denials. Finally, when we increase our list price, as we did in July 2015, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Accordingly, any revenue that we recognize as a result of cash collection in respect of previously performed but unpaid tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.\nImpact of Genzyme Co-promotion Agreements\nFrom January 2012 through September 9, 2016, we were party to a Co-Promotion Agreement with Genzyme to market the Afirma solution in the United States. The agreement required that we pay a certain percentage of our cash receipts from the sale of the Afirma solution to Genzyme, which percentage decreased over time, ranging from 50% in 2012 to 15% beginning January 1, 2015. We received a $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee from Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement, which we amortized over the estimated useful life based on the provisions of the agreement as a reduction to selling and marketing expenses.\nOn March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Agreement effective September 9, 2016 and the amortization of the upfront co-promotion fee was extended to that date. The final payments totaling $4.0 million under the Agreement were made in September 2016. We amortized $948,000 of the $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in 2015. The upfront co-promotion fee was fully amortized as of September 30, 2016.\nUnder the Ex-U.S. Agreement, or Ex-U.S. Agreement, we have agreed to pay Genzyme 25% of net revenue from the sale of the Afirma GEC test in Brazil and Singapore over a five-year period commencing January 1, 2015. Beginning in the fourth year of the agreement, which was effective in February 2015, if we terminate the agreement for convenience, we may be required to pay a termination fee contingent on the number of GEC billable results generated.\nDevelopment of Additional Products\nWe currently rely on sales of Afirma to generate all of our revenue. In May 2014, we commercially launched our Afirma Malignancy Classifiers, which we believe enhances our Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis as a comprehensive way to manage thyroid nodule patients and serve our current base of prescribing physicians. We are also pursuing development or acquisition of products for additional diseases to increase and diversify our revenue. We launched the Percepta test in April 2015. Additionally, we introduced in October 2016 a solution for interstitial lung disease, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, that will offer an alternative to surgery by developing a genomic signature to classify samples collected through less invasive bronchoscopy techniques. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development in order to expand the capabilities of our solutions and to develop additional products. Our success in developing or acquiring new products will be important in our efforts to grow our business by expanding the potential market for our products and diversifying our sources of revenue.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these\nexpenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2016, all of our revenue have been derived from the sale of Afirma. To date, Afirma has been delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers in excess of 10% of revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aetna\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed where we can reasonably estimate the amount we will ultimately receive at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payers, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately receive based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. In other situations, where we cannot reasonably estimate the amount that will be ultimately received, we recognize revenue on the cash basis. The incremental accrued revenue and decrease in loss from operations as a result of additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria was $4.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for tests delivered in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The incremental accrued revenue decreased loss per common share by $0.13, $0.03 and $0.04 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should we recognize revenue on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated reimbursement change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters.\nCost of Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are materials and service costs, including cytopathology testing services, stock-based compensation expense, direct labor costs, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping charges to transport samples, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we do not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases and from the higher costs of our new facility. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high and will increase disproportionately our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred research and development expenses in 2016 for the development and launch of Envisia and for the continued development and support of the Afirma and Percepta tests. In 2017, we expect to incur research and development expenses on ongoing evidence development for our Afirma. Percepta and Envisia classifiers.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, direct marketing expenses, consulting costs, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. In addition, co-promotion fees paid to Genzyme, net of amortization of the upfront fee received, are included in selling and marketing expenses. Beginning in November 2014, our personnel and marketing costs increased as we took on more sales and marketing responsibilities related to Afirma, but these increases were offset by the lower rate we were required to pay Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement beginning in January 2015. On March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement effective September 9, 2016. Consequently, in 2016, we further expanded our internal sales force and increased our marketing spending as we transitioned out of the relationship. We have also incurred increased selling and marketing expense as a result of investments in our lung product portfolio. We believe selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we launch and promote our new tests.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include those from executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, billing and client services, and quality and regulatory functions. These expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, costs associated with being a public company, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expect these expenses to continue to grow as we build our general and administration infrastructure and to stabilize thereafter.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nIntangible asset amortization began in April 2015 when we launched the Percepta test and as a result reclassified the indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset. The finite-lived intangible asset with a cost of $16.0 million is being amortized over 15 years, using the straight-line method.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under our loan and security agreement and the credit agreement that replaced it.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of sublease rental income and interest income received from payers and from our cash equivalents.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition. Our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. The service is completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the service. We recognize revenue related to billings for tests delivered on an accrual basis when amounts that will ultimately be realized can be reasonably estimated. The estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized require significant judgment by management. Until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial payer or governmental program, our tests may or may not be covered by these entities' existing reimbursement policies. In addition, patients do not enter into direct agreements with us that commit them to pay any portion of the cost of the tests in the event that their insurance declines to reimburse us. We may bill the patient directly for these amounts in the form of co-payments and co-insurance in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans. In the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be realized for our services, revenue is recognized on the cash basis.\nWe use judgment in determining if we are able to make a reasonable estimate of what will be ultimately realized. We also use judgment in estimating the amounts we expect to collect by payer. Our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain payment experience.\nBusiness Combination\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the recognition of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the business combination date. We allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets relates to intangible assets reclassified from indefinite-lived intangible assets, following the launch of Percepta in April 2015. We amortize finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of 15 years was used for the intangible asset related to Percepta based on management's estimate of product life, product life of other diagnostic tests and patent life. We test this finite-lived intangible asset for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below its carrying amount. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill, derived from our acquisition of Allegro, is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the\nexcess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars, except percentages)\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>15,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>28,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>23,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>93,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(28,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $15.6 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Given our continued focus on GEC growth and the adoption of the Afirma test, GEC tests increased by 20% and cytopathology tests increased by 7%. The increase in reagents, chips, consumables and related costs is associated primarily with increased GEC test volume and commission expense to a supplier corresponding increased GEC test volume, as well as additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual in 2016. The increase in cytopathology fees is related to the volume increase in FNA samples processed. The increase in sample collection costs is primarily related to increased volume of samples. The increase in direct labor is associated with an average lab headcount increase of 19%, the increase in sample volume, and the mix shift to relatively more GECs versus cytopathology tests, as more labor hours are incurred on GEC tests compared to cytopathology tests and at a higher average employee cost. Other costs are primarily indirect costs, such as facilities allocation, depreciation and equipment maintenance, which increased as a result of increased allocable costs, mainly due to our move into a larger facility in early 2016.\nCost of revenue increased $4.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in direct marketing expense was due primarily to expenses associated with Afirma, including trade shows, market research, advertising, public relations, speaker programs and, to a lesser extent, lung-related marketing expenses. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in information technology and facilities expenses that were related to sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees expense\n</td> <td>4,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and other facilities expense\n</td> <td>2,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to a 9% increase in average headcount in 2016 compared to 2015, increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, and higher employee separation costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower audit and legal expenses. The decrease in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring more months of facilities expenses in 2015 for our new South San Francisco facility and our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to consulting expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2015, largely related to accounting services that did not recur as we hired full-time staff, partially offset by higher general administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $3.7 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, as well as an 18% increase in average headcount in 2015 compared to 2014, offset by bonus and severance of $1.2 million associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in professional fees includes higher accounting, audit, legal and other corporate expenses including insurance, offset by $0.5 million of professional and consulting fees associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring expense for our new South San Francisco facility, as well as our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. While\nwe did not begin to make rent payments for our new South San Francisco facility until April 2016, in accordance with GAAP, the rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Prior to utilizing the space, this rent expense was being charged to general and administrative in the amount of approximately $0.5 million per quarter. The increase in other expense was due primarily to an increase in consulting expense of approximately $0.5 million and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in information technology and facilities costs as a result of higher allocations to other functions due to increased average headcount in other functions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest on the initial term loan of $25.0 million under a credit agreement entered into in March 2016. Interest expense decreased $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the debt modification under our amended loan and security agreement entered into in December 2014.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest income received. Other income (expense), net, increased $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to interest income received.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had a net loss of $31.4 million, $33.7 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2017 and in future years. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.1 million. We may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued and sold 5,723,300 shares of common stock in a public offering, at a price of $6.00 per share. We raised $32.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting expenses of 2.2 million.\nIn April 2015, we completed a private placement of 4,907,975 shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors at a purchase price of $8.15 per share. Gross proceeds to us were $40.0 million and we received $37.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us of $2.7 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $59.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and our revenue during the 12 months following March 1, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the 12 months following March 1, 2017.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, we have received $250.0 million in net proceeds from various sources to finance our operations, including net proceeds of $78.6 million from sales of our preferred stock, net proceeds of $59.2 million from our IPO, net proceeds of $37.3 million from our sale of common stock in a private placement, net proceeds of $31.9 million from our sale of common stock in a public offering, $10.0 million from the Co-Promotion Agreement, net borrowings of $4.9 million under our loan and security agreement, $24.5 million under our credit agreement, $3.2 million from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt of $0.4 million.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Visium Healthcare Partners, LP, or Visium. Under the Credit Agreement, two term loans are available to us with an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million. We drew down the initial $25.0 million term loan, or Initial Term Loan, on March 30, 2016. On or prior to June 30, 2017, we may request the second term loan of up to $15.0 million, or the Second Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the Second Term Loan are referred to as Term Loans, which mature on March 31, 2022.\nThe Term Loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 12.0% per annum, payable quarterly at the end of each March, June,\nSeptember and December. No principal payments will be due during an interest-only period, commencing on the funding date for the Initial Term Loan, or Initial Borrowing Date, and continuing through and including March 31, 2020. We are obligated to repay the outstanding principal amounts under the Term Loans in eight equal installments during the final two years under the Credit Agreement. For any quarterly interest payment through and including the 16th interest payment date after\nthe Initial Borrowing Date, so long as no event of default has occurred and is then continuing, we may elect to pay interest in cash on the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans at a fixed rate of 9.0%, with the remaining 3.0% of the 12.0% interest paid-in-kind by adding such paid-in-kind interest to the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans. We elected to pay interest in-kind for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and have recorded $385,000 of paid-in-kind interest through December 31, 2016.\nWe may prepay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loans subject to a minimum of $5.0 million of principal amount or a whole multiple of $1.0 million in excess thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium. The prepayment premium will be assessed on the principal amount repaid and will equal (i) 24.0% less the aggregate amount of all interest payments in cash, if the prepayment is made on or prior to March 31, 2018, (ii) 4.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2018 and on or prior to March 31, 2019, (iii) 2.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2019 and on or prior to March 31, 2020, and (iv) 1.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2020 and on or prior to March 31, 2021. After March 31, 2021 there is no prepayment premium.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among other provisions, covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge with or acquire other entities, dispose of assets, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our equity interests, engage in any material new line of business or enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring minimum cash and cash equivalents balances and minimum revenues. To the extent we form or acquire certain subsidiaries domiciled in the United States, those subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of our obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the loan covenants.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a loan and security agreement as subsequently amended ( 2013 Loan Agreement\u201d) with a financial institution that provided for borrowings of up to $10.0 million in aggregate. Borrowings under the 2013 Loan Agreement totaled $5.0 million, which was outstanding at January 1, 2015 and into 2016 until such amount was repaid in full upon entering into the Credit Agreement discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Allegro in September 2014, we issued 964,377 shares of our common stock, paid $2.7 million in cash, settled in cash outstanding indebtedness of Allegro totaling $4.3 million, and paid severance and bonus to Allegro personnel of $1.2 million.\nWe expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, working capital and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third-party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our products or development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,982\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,632\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>52,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.0 million. The net loss of $31.4 million includes non-cash charges of $0.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $6.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.1 million of intangible asset amortization, $0.4 million from conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt and $0.3 million in interest and prepayment penalty relating to the repayment of our borrowings under our 2013 Loan Agreement. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.4 million is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $27.0 million. The net loss of $33.7 million includes non-cash charges of $1.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $5.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.3 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $0.8 million intangible asset amortization following the launch of Percepta in April 2015, $0.1 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.5 million was due to an increase of $0.9 million in deferred rent, accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily from deferred rent from the lease for our new South San Francisco facility, offset by $0.4 million from an increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $27.6 million. The net loss of $29.4 million includes non-cash charges of $2.3 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.2 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.9 million was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and new payers for whom revenue is recognized on an accrual basis, a $1.1 million increase in supplies inventory due to the increased volume of testing performed and a strategic decision to increase our inventory on hand, offset by a $2.2 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the timing of payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.7 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $6.2 million used for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the new laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility and $0.5 million used as collateral for an irrevocable standby letter of credit as security for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.0 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $6.9 million of net cash used for the acquisition of Allegro, $2.0 million used for the purchase of laboratory equipment, software and leasehold improvements, and $0.1 million of restricted use cash to cover the hold-back liabilities associated with the acquisition of Allegro.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $52.3 million. The financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $31.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering, $24.5 million of net proceeds from the draw-down of the Initial Term Loan under the Credit Agreement and $1.2 million from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 million for the remaining principal balance and a $0.3 million of end-of-term payment and prepayment penalty related to the 2013 Loan Agreement that we repaid on March 30, 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $37.7 million, consisting of $37.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a private placement and $0.7 million of cash received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.2 million spent on deferred stock offering costs related to our shelf registration statement.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $0.4 million consisted of $0.7 million we received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.1 million of IPO-related disbursements and a $0.1 million end-of-term payment on the 2013 Loan Agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2018 to 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2020 to 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2022 and Beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplies purchase commitments\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligation\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2016, we entered into a capital lease for equipment which expires in December 2019.\nIn April 2015, we signed a non-cancelable lease agreement for approximately 59,000 square feet to serve as our new headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco. The lease began in June 2015 and expires in March 2026, and contains extension of lease term and expansion options.\nIn November 2012, we entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement commencing February 2013 for our laboratory and office space in Austin, Texas. The lease expires in July 2018.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments: (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt; (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods; (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans; (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans; (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated; and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for us beginning with our annual report for 2016 and interim periods thereafter. We have adopted this ASU and there is no impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require debt issuance costs to be presented as an offset against debt outstanding. The update does not change current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective to each prior period presented. We adopted this ASU and the retrospective adjustment of the prior period presentation was not material.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position, thereby simplifying the guidance that required an entity to separate deferred assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts, and was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We early-adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015 and the impact of adoption on our statement of financial position was not material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases. This ASU is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. The ASU will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, Compensation - Stock Compensation, related to the tax effects of share-based awards. The ASU requires that all the tax effects of share-based awards be recorded through the income statement, thereby simplifying the current guidance that requires excess tax benefits and certain excess tax deficiencies to be recorded in equity.

We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is fundamentally improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and machine learning to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward without risky, costly surgery that is often unnecessary.\nThe role of genomic information in medical practice is evolving rapidly and has affected the diagnosis of disease as well as treatment decisions. Over the past decade, molecular diagnostic tests that analyze genomic material from surgical tissue samples have emerged as an important complement to evaluations performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level enables one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the genomic information derived from these samples can help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care.\nWe deploy machine learning methods and RNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer and other diseases. In our thyroid and lung cancer indications, diagnosis can be ambiguous in approximately 15-70% of patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation. Our tests provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions in approximately half of those cases, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money.\nSince our founding in 2008, we have commercialized three genomic tests that we believe are transforming diagnostics: the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC, for thyroid cancer; the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for lung cancer; and the Envisia Genomic Classifier for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. Collectively, we believe these three tests address a $2 billion global market opportunity.\nThe published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. Nearly 30 clinical studies covering our products have been published, including two landmark clinical validation papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and interstitial lung diseases such as IPF as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach.\nWe believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling the company to set new standards in genomic test reimbursement. Our flagship product, the Afirma GEC, is now covered for more than 200 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis and our second commercial product, the Percepta classifier, is the first genomic test to gain Medicare coverage for improved lung cancer screening and diagnosis.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results\n \u2022 Revenue for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was $18.3 million and $65.1 million, respectively, an increase of 30% and 31% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Afirma Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) Reported Volume for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was 6,313 and 23,237, respectively, an increase of 13% and 20% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Operating Expenses for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, were $21.9 million and $93.9 million, respectively, an increase of 0% and 13% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was ($4.4) million and ($31.4) million, respectively, a 45% and 7% reduction from the prior year. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents was $59.2 million at December 31, 2016. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, the company raised $51.1 million in capital, including $19.2 million in net proceeds from its March 2016 debt financing and $31.9 million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock. \n \u2022 Cash Burn for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 (which is defined as net cash used in operating activities and purchases of property and equipment), was $4.7 million and $32.2 million, respectively, a 33% and 3% improvement compared to the prior year. \n2016 and Recent Business Highlights\nReimbursement:\n \u2022 Executed a Blues group-purchasing agreement in April 2016, accelerating Blues plan in-network contracting and overall reimbursement for the Afirma GEC thyroid cancer test. As of February 28, 2017, the company has more than 70 million Blues plan members under coverage and nearly 25 million under contract. \n \u2022 Expanded overall covered lives for the Afirma GEC by 50 million to nearly 225 million and overall contracted lives by 25 million to over 155 million as of February 28, 2017. \n \u2022 Achieved draft Medicare coverage policies for the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for use in lung cancer screening and diagnosis, leading to two final policies scheduled to become effective in March 2017. \nClinical Evidence and Commercial Expansion:\n \u2022 Clinical utility and cost-effectiveness data for the Percepta classifier were presented at the American Thoracic Society and the CHEST annual meetings, further suggesting that use of the Percepta classifier changes patient care and reduces healthcare costs as intended. \n \u2022 Launched the Envisia Genomic Classifier at the CHEST annual meeting in October 2016, in conjunction with the presentation of new data suggesting the test's ability to significantly improve the diagnosis of IPF without the need for risky, expensive surgery. \nPipeline Advancements:\n \u2022 Presented data at the American Thyroid Association meeting in September 2016, demonstrating the potential for a next-generation Afirma GEC, planned for 2017 introduction, to substantially increase the percentage of patients with benign thyroid nodules who may be able to avoid unnecessary surgery. \n \u2022 Data were published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggesting the potential for the field of injury\u201d technology behind Veracyte's Percepta classifier to enable lung cancer detection using a simple, non-invasive nasal swab test. \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThe Number of FNAs We Receive and GECs Performed\nThe growth in our business is tied to the number of FNAs we receive and the number of GECs performed. Approximately 84% of FNAs we receive are for the Afirma solution, which consists of services related to rendering a cytopathology diagnosis, and if the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the GEC is performed. The remaining approximate 16% of FNAs are received from customers performing cytopathology and when the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the FNA is sent to us for the GEC only. The rate at which adoption occurs in these two settings will cause these two percentages to fluctuate over time. Less than 1% of the FNA samples we receive for cytopathology have insufficient cellular material from which to render a cytopathology\ndiagnosis. We only bill the technical component, including slide preparation, for these tests. For results that are benign or suspicious/malignant by cytopathology, we bill for these services when we issue the report to the physician. If the cytopathology result is indeterminate, defined as atypia/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) or suspicious for FN/HCN, we perform the GEC. Historically, approximately 14%-17% of samples we have received for the Afirma solution have yielded indeterminate results by cytopathology. Approximately 5%-10% of the samples for GEC testing have insufficient RNA from which to render a result. The GEC can be reported as Benign, Suspicious or No Result. We bill for the GEC Benign and GEC Suspicious results only. After the GEC is completed, we issue the cytopathology report for the indeterminate results as well as the GEC report, and then bill for both of these tests. We incur costs of collecting and shipping the FNAs and a portion of the costs of performing tests where we cannot ultimately issue a patient report. Because we cannot bill for all samples received, the number of FNAs received does not directly correlate to the total number of patient reports issued and the amount billed.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for Afirma\nRevenue growth depends on both our ability to achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers and to expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider the GEC experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth will increase as more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our accrued revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of Afirma, we increased our sales force over the last several years, along with increasing our marketing efforts. We have hired institutional channel managers to focus on the institutional segment, where accounts generally send us FNAs for the GEC only, and account managers, dedicated to serving existing accounts, thereby freeing up our product specialists to focus on transacting new business. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on an accrual basis when we are able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement at the time delivery is complete. In the first period in which revenue is accrued for a particular payer or test, there generally is a one-time increase in revenue. Until we have contracts with payers or can reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be received, we recognize the related revenue on the cash basis. As we commercialize new products, we will need to be able to make a reasonable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be received from each payer for each new product offering prior to being able to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payers as well as one-time increases in revenue from newly accrued payers are difficult to predict, we expect that our revenue will fluctuate significantly in any given quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2016, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $161.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled $134 million. Of this amount, we recognized revenue of approximately $7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, when cash was received.\nOur average reimbursement per GEC was approximately $2,300 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 as compared with approximately $2,200 for the same period in 2015. The average quarterly reimbursement ranged from $2,100 to $2,300 in 2016 as compared to a range of $2,200 to $2,300 in 2015. The average GEC reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average GEC reimbursement from all payers, whether they are on the cash or an accrual basis, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. We use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over two quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus the average reimbursement per GEC represents the total cash collected to date against GEC tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of GEC tests performed during that same period.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive revenue from previously performed but unpaid tests. Revenue from these tests, if any, may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers and claims denials. Finally, when we increase our list price, as we did in July 2015, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Accordingly, any revenue that we recognize as a result of cash collection in respect of previously performed but unpaid tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.\nImpact of Genzyme Co-promotion Agreements\nFrom January 2012 through September 9, 2016, we were party to a Co-Promotion Agreement with Genzyme to market the Afirma solution in the United States. The agreement required that we pay a certain percentage of our cash receipts from the sale of the Afirma solution to Genzyme, which percentage decreased over time, ranging from 50% in 2012 to 15% beginning January 1, 2015. We received a $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee from Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement, which we amortized over the estimated useful life based on the provisions of the agreement as a reduction to selling and marketing expenses.\nOn March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Agreement effective September 9, 2016 and the amortization of the upfront co-promotion fee was extended to that date. The final payments totaling $4.0 million under the Agreement were made in September 2016. We amortized $948,000 of the $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in 2015. The upfront co-promotion fee was fully amortized as of September 30, 2016.\nUnder the Ex-U.S. Agreement, or Ex-U.S. Agreement, we have agreed to pay Genzyme 25% of net revenue from the sale of the Afirma GEC test in Brazil and Singapore over a five-year period commencing January 1, 2015. Beginning in the fourth year of the agreement, which was effective in February 2015, if we terminate the agreement for convenience, we may be required to pay a termination fee contingent on the number of GEC billable results generated.\nDevelopment of Additional Products\nWe currently rely on sales of Afirma to generate all of our revenue. In May 2014, we commercially launched our Afirma Malignancy Classifiers, which we believe enhances our Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis as a comprehensive way to manage thyroid nodule patients and serve our current base of prescribing physicians. We are also pursuing development or acquisition of products for additional diseases to increase and diversify our revenue. We launched the Percepta test in April 2015. Additionally, we introduced in October 2016 a solution for interstitial lung disease, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, that will offer an alternative to surgery by developing a genomic signature to classify samples collected through less invasive bronchoscopy techniques. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development in order to expand the capabilities of our solutions and to develop additional products. Our success in developing or acquiring new products will be important in our efforts to grow our business by expanding the potential market for our products and diversifying our sources of revenue.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these\nexpenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2016, all of our revenue have been derived from the sale of Afirma. To date, Afirma has been delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers in excess of 10% of revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aetna\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed where we can reasonably estimate the amount we will ultimately receive at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payers, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately receive based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. In other situations, where we cannot reasonably estimate the amount that will be ultimately received, we recognize revenue on the cash basis. The incremental accrued revenue and decrease in loss from operations as a result of additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria was $4.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for tests delivered in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The incremental accrued revenue decreased loss per common share by $0.13, $0.03 and $0.04 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should we recognize revenue on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated reimbursement change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters.\nCost of Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are materials and service costs, including cytopathology testing services, stock-based compensation expense, direct labor costs, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping charges to transport samples, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we do not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases and from the higher costs of our new facility. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high and will increase disproportionately our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred research and development expenses in 2016 for the development and launch of Envisia and for the continued development and support of the Afirma and Percepta tests. In 2017, we expect to incur research and development expenses on ongoing evidence development for our Afirma. Percepta and Envisia classifiers.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, direct marketing expenses, consulting costs, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. In addition, co-promotion fees paid to Genzyme, net of amortization of the upfront fee received, are included in selling and marketing expenses. Beginning in November 2014, our personnel and marketing costs increased as we took on more sales and marketing responsibilities related to Afirma, but these increases were offset by the lower rate we were required to pay Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement beginning in January 2015. On March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement effective September 9, 2016. Consequently, in 2016, we further expanded our internal sales force and increased our marketing spending as we transitioned out of the relationship. We have also incurred increased selling and marketing expense as a result of investments in our lung product portfolio. We believe selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we launch and promote our new tests.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include those from executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, billing and client services, and quality and regulatory functions. These expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, costs associated with being a public company, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expect these expenses to continue to grow as we build our general and administration infrastructure and to stabilize thereafter.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nIntangible asset amortization began in April 2015 when we launched the Percepta test and as a result reclassified the indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset. The finite-lived intangible asset with a cost of $16.0 million is being amortized over 15 years, using the straight-line method.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under our loan and security agreement and the credit agreement that replaced it.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of sublease rental income and interest income received from payers and from our cash equivalents.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition. Our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. The service is completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the service. We recognize revenue related to billings for tests delivered on an accrual basis when amounts that will ultimately be realized can be reasonably estimated. The estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized require significant judgment by management. Until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial payer or governmental program, our tests may or may not be covered by these entities' existing reimbursement policies. In addition, patients do not enter into direct agreements with us that commit them to pay any portion of the cost of the tests in the event that their insurance declines to reimburse us. We may bill the patient directly for these amounts in the form of co-payments and co-insurance in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans. In the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be realized for our services, revenue is recognized on the cash basis.\nWe use judgment in determining if we are able to make a reasonable estimate of what will be ultimately realized. We also use judgment in estimating the amounts we expect to collect by payer. Our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain payment experience.\nBusiness Combination\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the recognition of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the business combination date. We allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets relates to intangible assets reclassified from indefinite-lived intangible assets, following the launch of Percepta in April 2015. We amortize finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of 15 years was used for the intangible asset related to Percepta based on management's estimate of product life, product life of other diagnostic tests and patent life. We test this finite-lived intangible asset for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below its carrying amount. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill, derived from our acquisition of Allegro, is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the\nexcess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars, except percentages)\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>25,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>15,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>28,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>23,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>93,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(28,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,460\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,757\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,379\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $15.6 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Given our continued focus on GEC growth and the adoption of the Afirma test, GEC tests increased by 20% and cytopathology tests increased by 7%. The increase in reagents, chips, consumables and related costs is associated primarily with increased GEC test volume and commission expense to a supplier corresponding increased GEC test volume, as well as additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual in 2016. The increase in cytopathology fees is related to the volume increase in FNA samples processed. The increase in sample collection costs is primarily related to increased volume of samples. The increase in direct labor is associated with an average lab headcount increase of 19%, the increase in sample volume, and the mix shift to relatively more GECs versus cytopathology tests, as more labor hours are incurred on GEC tests compared to cytopathology tests and at a higher average employee cost. Other costs are primarily indirect costs, such as facilities allocation, depreciation and equipment maintenance, which increased as a result of increased allocable costs, mainly due to our move into a larger facility in early 2016.\nCost of revenue increased $4.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in direct marketing expense was due primarily to expenses associated with Afirma, including trade shows, market research, advertising, public relations, speaker programs and, to a lesser extent, lung-related marketing expenses. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in information technology and facilities expenses that were related to sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>3,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees expense\n</td> <td>4,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(623\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent and other facilities expense\n</td> <td>2,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(590\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to a 9% increase in average headcount in 2016 compared to 2015, increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, and higher employee separation costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower audit and legal expenses. The decrease in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring more months of facilities expenses in 2015 for our new South San Francisco facility and our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to consulting expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2015, largely related to accounting services that did not recur as we hired full-time staff, partially offset by higher general administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $3.7 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, as well as an 18% increase in average headcount in 2015 compared to 2014, offset by bonus and severance of $1.2 million associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in professional fees includes higher accounting, audit, legal and other corporate expenses including insurance, offset by $0.5 million of professional and consulting fees associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring expense for our new South San Francisco facility, as well as our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. While\nwe did not begin to make rent payments for our new South San Francisco facility until April 2016, in accordance with GAAP, the rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Prior to utilizing the space, this rent expense was being charged to general and administrative in the amount of approximately $0.5 million per quarter. The increase in other expense was due primarily to an increase in consulting expense of approximately $0.5 million and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in information technology and facilities costs as a result of higher allocations to other functions due to increased average headcount in other functions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest on the initial term loan of $25.0 million under a credit agreement entered into in March 2016. Interest expense decreased $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the debt modification under our amended loan and security agreement entered into in December 2014.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest income received. Other income (expense), net, increased $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to interest income received.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had a net loss of $31.4 million, $33.7 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2017 and in future years. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.1 million. We may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued and sold 5,723,300 shares of common stock in a public offering, at a price of $6.00 per share. We raised $32.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting expenses of 2.2 million.\nIn April 2015, we completed a private placement of 4,907,975 shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors at a purchase price of $8.15 per share. Gross proceeds to us were $40.0 million and we received $37.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us of $2.7 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $59.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and our revenue during the 12 months following March 1, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the 12 months following March 1, 2017.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, we have received $250.0 million in net proceeds from various sources to finance our operations, including net proceeds of $78.6 million from sales of our preferred stock, net proceeds of $59.2 million from our IPO, net proceeds of $37.3 million from our sale of common stock in a private placement, net proceeds of $31.9 million from our sale of common stock in a public offering, $10.0 million from the Co-Promotion Agreement, net borrowings of $4.9 million under our loan and security agreement, $24.5 million under our credit agreement, $3.2 million from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt of $0.4 million.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Visium Healthcare Partners, LP, or Visium. Under the Credit Agreement, two term loans are available to us with an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million. We drew down the initial $25.0 million term loan, or Initial Term Loan, on March 30, 2016. On or prior to June 30, 2017, we may request the second term loan of up to $15.0 million, or the Second Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the Second Term Loan are referred to as Term Loans, which mature on March 31, 2022.\nThe Term Loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 12.0% per annum, payable quarterly at the end of each March, June,\nSeptember and December. No principal payments will be due during an interest-only period, commencing on the funding date for the Initial Term Loan, or Initial Borrowing Date, and continuing through and including March 31, 2020. We are obligated to repay the outstanding principal amounts under the Term Loans in eight equal installments during the final two years under the Credit Agreement. For any quarterly interest payment through and including the 16th interest payment date after\nthe Initial Borrowing Date, so long as no event of default has occurred and is then continuing, we may elect to pay interest in cash on the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans at a fixed rate of 9.0%, with the remaining 3.0% of the 12.0% interest paid-in-kind by adding such paid-in-kind interest to the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans. We elected to pay interest in-kind for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and have recorded $385,000 of paid-in-kind interest through December 31, 2016.\nWe may prepay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loans subject to a minimum of $5.0 million of principal amount or a whole multiple of $1.0 million in excess thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium. The prepayment premium will be assessed on the principal amount repaid and will equal (i) 24.0% less the aggregate amount of all interest payments in cash, if the prepayment is made on or prior to March 31, 2018, (ii) 4.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2018 and on or prior to March 31, 2019, (iii) 2.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2019 and on or prior to March 31, 2020, and (iv) 1.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2020 and on or prior to March 31, 2021. After March 31, 2021 there is no prepayment premium.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among other provisions, covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge with or acquire other entities, dispose of assets, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our equity interests, engage in any material new line of business or enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring minimum cash and cash equivalents balances and minimum revenues. To the extent we form or acquire certain subsidiaries domiciled in the United States, those subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of our obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the loan covenants.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a loan and security agreement as subsequently amended ( 2013 Loan Agreement\u201d) with a financial institution that provided for borrowings of up to $10.0 million in aggregate. Borrowings under the 2013 Loan Agreement totaled $5.0 million, which was outstanding at January 1, 2015 and into 2016 until such amount was repaid in full upon entering into the Credit Agreement discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Allegro in September 2014, we issued 964,377 shares of our common stock, paid $2.7 million in cash, settled in cash outstanding indebtedness of Allegro totaling $4.3 million, and paid severance and bonus to Allegro personnel of $1.2 million.\nWe expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, working capital and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third-party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our products or development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,982\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,965\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,632\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(4,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>52,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.0 million. The net loss of $31.4 million includes non-cash charges of $0.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $6.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.1 million of intangible asset amortization, $0.4 million from conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt and $0.3 million in interest and prepayment penalty relating to the repayment of our borrowings under our 2013 Loan Agreement. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.4 million is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $27.0 million. The net loss of $33.7 million includes non-cash charges of $1.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $5.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.3 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $0.8 million intangible asset amortization following the launch of Percepta in April 2015, $0.1 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.5 million was due to an increase of $0.9 million in deferred rent, accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily from deferred rent from the lease for our new South San Francisco facility, offset by $0.4 million from an increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $27.6 million. The net loss of $29.4 million includes non-cash charges of $2.3 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.2 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.9 million was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and new payers for whom revenue is recognized on an accrual basis, a $1.1 million increase in supplies inventory due to the increased volume of testing performed and a strategic decision to increase our inventory on hand, offset by a $2.2 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the timing of payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.7 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $6.2 million used for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the new laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility and $0.5 million used as collateral for an irrevocable standby letter of credit as security for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.0 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $6.9 million of net cash used for the acquisition of Allegro, $2.0 million used for the purchase of laboratory equipment, software and leasehold improvements, and $0.1 million of restricted use cash to cover the hold-back liabilities associated with the acquisition of Allegro.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $52.3 million. The financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $31.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering, $24.5 million of net proceeds from the draw-down of the Initial Term Loan under the Credit Agreement and $1.2 million from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 million for the remaining principal balance and a $0.3 million of end-of-term payment and prepayment penalty related to the 2013 Loan Agreement that we repaid on March 30, 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $37.7 million, consisting of $37.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a private placement and $0.7 million of cash received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.2 million spent on deferred stock offering costs related to our shelf registration statement.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $0.4 million consisted of $0.7 million we received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.1 million of IPO-related disbursements and a $0.1 million end-of-term payment on the 2013 Loan Agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2018 to 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2020 to 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2022 and Beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplies purchase commitments\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligation\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2016, we entered into a capital lease for equipment which expires in December 2019.\nIn April 2015, we signed a non-cancelable lease agreement for approximately 59,000 square feet to serve as our new headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco. The lease began in June 2015 and expires in March 2026, and contains extension of lease term and expansion options.\nIn November 2012, we entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement commencing February 2013 for our laboratory and office space in Austin, Texas. The lease expires in July 2018.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments: (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt; (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods; (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans; (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans; (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated; and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for us beginning with our annual report for 2016 and interim periods thereafter. We have adopted this ASU and there is no impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require debt issuance costs to be presented as an offset against debt outstanding. The update does not change current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective to each prior period presented. We adopted this ASU and the retrospective adjustment of the prior period presentation was not material.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position, thereby simplifying the guidance that required an entity to separate deferred assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts, and was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We early-adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015 and the impact of adoption on our statement of financial position was not material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases. This ASU is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. The ASU will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, Compensation - Stock Compensation, related to the tax effects of share-based awards. The ASU requires that all the tax effects of share-based awards be recorded through the income statement, thereby simplifying the current guidance that requires excess tax benefits and certain excess tax deficiencies to be recorded in equity. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash.

We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial statements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is fundamentally improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and machine learning to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward without risky, costly surgery that is often unnecessary.\nThe role of genomic information in medical practice is evolving rapidly and has affected the diagnosis of disease as well as treatment decisions. Over the past decade, molecular diagnostic tests that analyze genomic material from surgical tissue samples have emerged as an important complement to evaluations performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level enables one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the genomic information derived from these samples can help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care.\nWe deploy machine learning methods and RNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer and other diseases. In our thyroid and lung cancer indications, diagnosis can be ambiguous in approximately 15-70% of patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation. Our tests provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions in approximately half of those cases, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money.\nSince our founding in 2008, we have commercialized three genomic tests that we believe are transforming diagnostics: the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC, for thyroid cancer; the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for lung cancer; and the Envisia Genomic Classifier for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. Collectively, we believe these three tests address a $2 billion global market opportunity.\nThe published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. Nearly 30 clinical studies covering our products have been published, including two landmark clinical validation papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and interstitial lung diseases such as IPF as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach.\nWe believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling the company to set new standards in genomic test reimbursement. Our flagship product, the Afirma GEC, is now covered for more than 200 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis and our second commercial product, the Percepta classifier, is the first genomic test to gain Medicare coverage for improved lung cancer screening and diagnosis.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results\n \u2022 Revenue for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was $18.3 million and $65.1 million, respectively, an increase of 30% and 31% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Afirma Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) Reported Volume for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was 6,313 and 23,237, respectively, an increase of 13% and 20% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Operating Expenses for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016, were $21.9 million and $93.9 million, respectively, an increase of 0% and 13% over the prior year. \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 was ($4.4) million and ($31.4) million, respectively, a 45% and 7% reduction from the prior year. \n \u2022 Cash and cash equivalents was $59.2 million at December 31, 2016. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, the company raised $51.1 million in capital, including $19.2 million in net proceeds from its March 2016 debt financing and $31.9 million in net proceeds from a public offering of common stock. \n \u2022 Cash Burn for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016 (which is defined as net cash used in operating activities and purchases of property and equipment), was $4.7 million and $32.2 million, respectively, a 33% and 3% improvement compared to the prior year. \n2016 and Recent Business Highlights\nReimbursement:\n \u2022 Executed a Blues group-purchasing agreement in April 2016, accelerating Blues plan in-network contracting and overall reimbursement for the Afirma GEC thyroid cancer test. As of February 28, 2017, the company has more than 70 million Blues plan members under coverage and nearly 25 million under contract. \n \u2022 Expanded overall covered lives for the Afirma GEC by 50 million to nearly 225 million and overall contracted lives by 25 million to over 155 million as of February 28, 2017. \n \u2022 Achieved draft Medicare coverage policies for the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for use in lung cancer screening and diagnosis, leading to two final policies scheduled to become effective in March 2017. \nClinical Evidence and Commercial Expansion:\n \u2022 Clinical utility and cost-effectiveness data for the Percepta classifier were presented at the American Thoracic Society and the CHEST annual meetings, further suggesting that use of the Percepta classifier changes patient care and reduces healthcare costs as intended. \n \u2022 Launched the Envisia Genomic Classifier at the CHEST annual meeting in October 2016, in conjunction with the presentation of new data suggesting the test's ability to significantly improve the diagnosis of IPF without the need for risky, expensive surgery. \nPipeline Advancements:\n \u2022 Presented data at the American Thyroid Association meeting in September 2016, demonstrating the potential for a next-generation Afirma GEC, planned for 2017 introduction, to substantially increase the percentage of patients with benign thyroid nodules who may be able to avoid unnecessary surgery. \n \u2022 Data were published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggesting the potential for the field of injury\u201d technology behind Veracyte's Percepta classifier to enable lung cancer detection using a simple, non-invasive nasal swab test. \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThe Number of FNAs We Receive and GECs Performed\nThe growth in our business is tied to the number of FNAs we receive and the number of GECs performed. Approximately 84% of FNAs we receive are for the Afirma solution, which consists of services related to rendering a cytopathology diagnosis, and if the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the GEC is performed. The remaining approximate 16% of FNAs are received from customers performing cytopathology and when the cytopathology result is indeterminate, the FNA is sent to us for the GEC only. The rate at which adoption occurs in these two settings will cause these two percentages to fluctuate over time. Less than 1% of the FNA samples we receive for cytopathology have insufficient cellular material from which to render a cytopathology\ndiagnosis. We only bill the technical component, including slide preparation, for these tests. For results that are benign or suspicious/malignant by cytopathology, we bill for these services when we issue the report to the physician. If the cytopathology result is indeterminate, defined as atypia/follicular lesions of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) or suspicious for FN/HCN, we perform the GEC. Historically, approximately 14%-17% of samples we have received for the Afirma solution have yielded indeterminate results by cytopathology. Approximately 5%-10% of the samples for GEC testing have insufficient RNA from which to render a result. The GEC can be reported as Benign, Suspicious or No Result. We bill for the GEC Benign and GEC Suspicious results only. After the GEC is completed, we issue the cytopathology report for the indeterminate results as well as the GEC report, and then bill for both of these tests. We incur costs of collecting and shipping the FNAs and a portion of the costs of performing tests where we cannot ultimately issue a patient report. Because we cannot bill for all samples received, the number of FNAs received does not directly correlate to the total number of patient reports issued and the amount billed.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for Afirma\nRevenue growth depends on both our ability to achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers and to expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider the GEC experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth will increase as more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our accrued revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of Afirma, we increased our sales force over the last several years, along with increasing our marketing efforts. We have hired institutional channel managers to focus on the institutional segment, where accounts generally send us FNAs for the GEC only, and account managers, dedicated to serving existing accounts, thereby freeing up our product specialists to focus on transacting new business. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nWe recognize revenue on an accrual basis when we are able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement at the time delivery is complete. In the first period in which revenue is accrued for a particular payer or test, there generally is a one-time increase in revenue. Until we have contracts with payers or can reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be received, we recognize the related revenue on the cash basis. As we commercialize new products, we will need to be able to make a reasonable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be received from each payer for each new product offering prior to being able to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payers as well as one-time increases in revenue from newly accrued payers are difficult to predict, we expect that our revenue will fluctuate significantly in any given quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2016, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $161.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled $134 million. Of this amount, we recognized revenue of approximately $7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, when cash was received.\nOur average reimbursement per GEC was approximately $2,300 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 as compared with approximately $2,200 for the same period in 2015. The average quarterly reimbursement ranged from $2,100 to $2,300 in 2016 as compared to a range of $2,200 to $2,300 in 2015. The average GEC reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.\nWe calculate the average GEC reimbursement from all payers, whether they are on the cash or an accrual basis, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. We use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over two quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus the average reimbursement per GEC represents the total cash collected to date against GEC tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of GEC tests performed during that same period.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive revenue from previously performed but unpaid tests. Revenue from these tests, if any, may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers and claims denials. Finally, when we increase our list price, as we did in July 2015, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Accordingly, any revenue that we recognize as a result of cash collection in respect of previously performed but unpaid tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.\nImpact of Genzyme Co-promotion Agreements\nFrom January 2012 through September 9, 2016, we were party to a Co-Promotion Agreement with Genzyme to market the Afirma solution in the United States. The agreement required that we pay a certain percentage of our cash receipts from the sale of the Afirma solution to Genzyme, which percentage decreased over time, ranging from 50% in 2012 to 15% beginning January 1, 2015. We received a $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee from Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement, which we amortized over the estimated useful life based on the provisions of the agreement as a reduction to selling and marketing expenses.\nOn March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Agreement effective September 9, 2016 and the amortization of the upfront co-promotion fee was extended to that date. The final payments totaling $4.0 million under the Agreement were made in September 2016. We amortized $948,000 of the $10.0 million upfront co-promotion fee in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million in the same period in 2015. The upfront co-promotion fee was fully amortized as of September 30, 2016.\nUnder the Ex-U.S. Agreement, or Ex-U.S. Agreement, we have agreed to pay Genzyme 25% of net revenue from the sale of the Afirma GEC test in Brazil and Singapore over a five-year period commencing January 1, 2015. Beginning in the fourth year of the agreement, which was effective in February 2015, if we terminate the agreement for convenience, we may be required to pay a termination fee contingent on the number of GEC billable results generated.\nDevelopment of Additional Products\nWe currently rely on sales of Afirma to generate all of our revenue. In May 2014, we commercially launched our Afirma Malignancy Classifiers, which we believe enhances our Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis as a comprehensive way to manage thyroid nodule patients and serve our current base of prescribing physicians. We are also pursuing development or acquisition of products for additional diseases to increase and diversify our revenue. We launched the Percepta test in April 2015. Additionally, we introduced in October 2016 a solution for interstitial lung disease, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, that will offer an alternative to surgery by developing a genomic signature to classify samples collected through less invasive bronchoscopy techniques. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development in order to expand the capabilities of our solutions and to develop additional products. Our success in developing or acquiring new products will be important in our efforts to grow our business by expanding the potential market for our products and diversifying our sources of revenue.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these\nexpenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenue\nThrough December 31, 2016, all of our revenue have been derived from the sale of Afirma. To date, Afirma has been delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers in excess of 10% of revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\n\nFor tests performed where we can reasonably estimate the amount we will ultimately receive at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payers, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately receive based on a per payer, per contract or agreement basis. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. In other situations, where we cannot reasonably estimate the amount that will be ultimately received, we recognize revenue on the cash basis. The incremental accrued revenue and decrease in loss from operations as a result of additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria was $4.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for tests delivered in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The incremental accrued revenue decreased loss per common share by $0.13, $0.03 and $0.04 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should we recognize revenue on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated reimbursement change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters.\nCost of Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are materials and service costs, including cytopathology testing services, stock-based compensation expense, direct labor costs, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, shipping charges to transport samples, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether or when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we do not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases and from the higher costs of our new facility. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high and will increase disproportionately our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, prototype materials, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred research and development expenses in 2016 for the development and launch of Envisia and for the continued development and support of the Afirma and Percepta tests. In 2017, we expect to incur research and development expenses on ongoing evidence development for our Afirma. Percepta and Envisia classifiers.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, direct marketing expenses, consulting costs, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. In addition, co-promotion fees paid to Genzyme, net of amortization of the upfront fee received, are included in selling and marketing expenses. Beginning in November 2014, our personnel and marketing costs increased as we took on more sales and marketing responsibilities related to Afirma, but these increases were offset by the lower rate we were required to pay Genzyme under the Co-Promotion Agreement beginning in January 2015. On March 9, 2016, we gave Genzyme notice of termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement effective September 9, 2016. Consequently, in 2016, we further expanded our internal sales force and increased our marketing spending as we transitioned out of the relationship. We have also incurred increased selling and marketing expense as a result of investments in our lung product portfolio. We believe selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we launch and promote our new tests.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include those from executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, billing and client services, and quality and regulatory functions. These expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, costs associated with being a public company, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. We expect these expenses to continue to grow as we build our general and administration infrastructure and to stabilize thereafter.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nIntangible asset amortization began in April 2015 when we launched the Percepta test and as a result reclassified the indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset. The finite-lived intangible asset with a cost of $16.0 million is being amortized over 15 years, using the straight-line method.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under our loan and security agreement and the credit agreement that replaced it.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of sublease rental income and interest income received from payers and from our cash equivalents.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition. Our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. The service is completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the service. We recognize revenue related to billings for tests delivered on an accrual basis when amounts that will ultimately be realized can be reasonably estimated. The estimates of amounts that will ultimately be realized require significant judgment by management. Until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial payer or governmental program, our tests may or may not be covered by these entities' existing reimbursement policies. In addition, patients do not enter into direct agreements with us that commit them to pay any portion of the cost of the tests in the event that their insurance declines to reimburse us. We may bill the patient directly for these amounts in the form of co-payments and co-insurance in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans. In the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or the ability to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be realized for our services, revenue is recognized on the cash basis.\nWe use judgment in determining if we are able to make a reasonable estimate of what will be ultimately realized. We also use judgment in estimating the amounts we expect to collect by payer. Our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain payment experience.\nBusiness Combination\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the recognition of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the business combination date. We allocate any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets relates to intangible assets reclassified from indefinite-lived intangible assets, following the launch of Percepta in April 2015. We amortize finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of 15 years was used for the intangible asset related to Percepta based on management's estimate of product life, product life of other diagnostic tests and patent life. We test this finite-lived intangible asset for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below its carrying amount. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill, derived from our acquisition of Allegro, is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the\nexcess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars, except percentages)\n\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $15.6 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increased adoption of Afirma and the resultant increase in tests delivered, especially the proportion of GEC tests reported and additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual. Revenue recognized when cash is received has decreased because more payers who were previously recognized on the cash basis have met our revenue recognition criteria and are recognized on an accrual basis.\nRevenue increased $11.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased adoption of Afirma and the resultant increase in tests delivered, especially the proportion of GEC tests reported, and, to a lesser extent, additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual, partially offset by a decrease in revenue recorded when cash is received. Cash revenue for the year December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by $0.5 million of catch-up payments.\nRevenue recognized on an accrual basis and when cash is received for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nCost of revenue\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nCost of revenue increased $4.0 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Given our continued focus on GEC growth and the adoption of the Afirma test, GEC tests increased by 20% and cytopathology tests increased by 7%. The increase in reagents, chips, consumables and related costs is associated primarily with increased GEC test volume and commission expense to a supplier corresponding increased GEC test volume, as well as additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual in 2016. The increase in cytopathology fees is related to the volume increase in FNA samples processed. The increase in sample collection costs is primarily related to increased volume of samples. The increase in direct labor is associated with an average lab headcount increase of 19%, the increase in sample volume, and the mix shift to relatively more GECs versus cytopathology tests, as more labor hours are incurred on GEC tests compared to cytopathology tests and at a higher average employee cost. Other costs are primarily indirect costs, such as facilities allocation, depreciation and equipment maintenance, which increased as a result of increased allocable costs, mainly due to our move into a larger facility in early 2016.\nCost of revenue increased $4.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Given our continued focus on GEC growth and the adoption of the Afirma test, GEC tests increased by 38% and cytopathology tests increased by 13%. The increase in reagents, chips, consumables and related costs is associated primarily with increased GEC test volume. The increase in cytopathology fees is related to the volume increase in FNA samples processed. The increase in sample collection costs is primarily related to increased volume of samples. The increase in direct labor is associated with the increase in sample volume and the mix shift to relatively more GECs versus cytopathology tests, as more labor hours are incurred on GEC tests compared to cytopathology tests and at a higher average employee cost. Other costs are primarily indirect costs, such as facilities allocation, depreciation and equipment maintenance, which increased as a result of increased allocable costs and increased allocation to cost of revenue due to an average headcount increase of 34%.\nResearch and development\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nResearch and development expense increased $2.5 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to an 8% increase in average headcount including an increase in senior level positions, and increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in direct R&D expense was primarily due to materials purchased for research and development experiments. Other expense increased primarily as a result of depreciation and increased information technology and facilities expenses that were related to research and development activities.\nResearch and development expense increased $3.0 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance as well as an 18% increase in average headcount in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in direct R&D expense was primarily due to increased clinical expenses associated with our ongoing thyroid studies and the Percepta clinical utility study and materials purchased for research and development experiments. Other expense increased primarily as a result of consulting and increased information technology and facilities expenses that were related to research and development activities.\nSelling and marketing\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nSelling and marketing expense increased $3.0 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in Genzyme co-promotion expense, net, reflects the termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement in September 2016 offset by higher co-promotion fees from an increase in cash collections for Afirma up to the termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to a 30% increase in average headcount of our sales and marketing team as a result of the termination of the Co-Promotion Agreement, as well as increased commissions. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to a reduction of consulting expenses.\nSelling and marketing expense increased $3.4 million, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in Genzyme co-promotion expense, net, reflects a reduction in the co-promotion percentage rate payable to Genzyme in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by growth in cash collections. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to a 47% increase in average headcount of our sales and marketing team in 2015 compared to 2014, as well as increased commissions and accrued bonus as a result of increased performance and bonus targets. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in direct marketing expense was due primarily to expenses associated with Afirma, including trade shows, market research, advertising, public relations, speaker programs and, to a lesser extent, lung-related marketing expenses. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses and, to a lesser extent, an increase in information technology and facilities expenses that were related to sales and marketing activities.\nGeneral and administrative\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\n\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $1.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to a 9% increase in average headcount in 2016 compared to 2015, increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, and higher employee separation costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The decrease in professional fees was primarily due to lower audit and legal expenses. The decrease in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring more months of facilities expenses in 2015 for our new South San Francisco facility and our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to consulting expense of approximately $1.2 million in 2015, largely related to accounting services that did not recur as we hired full-time staff, partially offset by higher general administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $3.7 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in personnel-related expense was primarily due to increased accrued bonuses as a result of increased bonus targets and performance, as well as an 18% increase in average headcount in 2015 compared to 2014, offset by bonus and severance of $1.2 million associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to option grants to new and existing employees. The increase in professional fees includes higher accounting, audit, legal and other corporate expenses including insurance, offset by $0.5 million of professional and consulting fees associated with the Allegro acquisition in 2014. The increase in rent and other facilities expense was largely due to incurring expense for our new South San Francisco facility, as well as our previous space, for which the lease ended in March 2016. While\nwe did not begin to make rent payments for our new South San Francisco facility until April 2016, in accordance with GAAP, the rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Prior to utilizing the space, this rent expense was being charged to general and administrative in the amount of approximately $0.5 million per quarter. The increase in other expense was due primarily to an increase in consulting expense of approximately $0.5 million and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in information technology and facilities costs as a result of higher allocations to other functions due to increased average headcount in other functions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest on the initial term loan of $25.0 million under a credit agreement entered into in March 2016. Interest expense decreased $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the debt modification under our amended loan and security agreement entered into in December 2014.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net, increased $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to interest income received. Other income (expense), net, increased $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to interest income received.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had a net loss of $31.4 million, $33.7 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2017 and in future years. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $180.1 million. We may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses.\nIn November 2016, we issued and sold 5,723,300 shares of common stock in a public offering, at a price of $6.00 per share. We raised $32.1 million in net proceeds, after deducting expenses of 2.2 million.\nIn April 2015, we completed a private placement of 4,907,975 shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors at a purchase price of $8.15 per share. Gross proceeds to us were $40.0 million and we received $37.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us of $2.7 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $59.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and our revenue during the 12 months following March 1, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the 12 months following March 1, 2017.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2016, we have received $250.0 million in net proceeds from various sources to finance our operations, including net proceeds of $78.6 million from sales of our preferred stock, net proceeds of $59.2 million from our IPO, net proceeds of $37.3 million from our sale of common stock in a private placement, net proceeds of $31.9 million from our sale of common stock in a public offering, $10.0 million from the Co-Promotion Agreement, net borrowings of $4.9 million under our loan and security agreement, $24.5 million under our credit agreement, $3.2 million from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt of $0.4 million.\nIn March 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Visium Healthcare Partners, LP, or Visium. Under the Credit Agreement, two term loans are available to us with an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million. We drew down the initial $25.0 million term loan, or Initial Term Loan, on March 30, 2016. On or prior to June 30, 2017, we may request the second term loan of up to $15.0 million, or the Second Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the Second Term Loan are referred to as Term Loans, which mature on March 31, 2022.\nThe Term Loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 12.0% per annum, payable quarterly at the end of each March, June,\nSeptember and December. No principal payments will be due during an interest-only period, commencing on the funding date for the Initial Term Loan, or Initial Borrowing Date, and continuing through and including March 31, 2020. We are obligated to repay the outstanding principal amounts under the Term Loans in eight equal installments during the final two years under the Credit Agreement. For any quarterly interest payment through and including the 16th interest payment date after\nthe Initial Borrowing Date, so long as no event of default has occurred and is then continuing, we may elect to pay interest in cash on the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans at a fixed rate of 9.0%, with the remaining 3.0% of the 12.0% interest paid-in-kind by adding such paid-in-kind interest to the outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans. We elected to pay interest in-kind for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and have recorded $385,000 of paid-in-kind interest through December 31, 2016.\nWe may prepay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loans subject to a minimum of $5.0 million of principal amount or a whole multiple of $1.0 million in excess thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium. The prepayment premium will be assessed on the principal amount repaid and will equal (i) 24.0% less the aggregate amount of all interest payments in cash, if the prepayment is made on or prior to March 31, 2018, (ii) 4.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2018 and on or prior to March 31, 2019, (iii) 2.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2019 and on or prior to March 31, 2020, and (iv) 1.0%, if the prepayment is made after March 31, 2020 and on or prior to March 31, 2021. After March 31, 2021 there is no prepayment premium.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among other provisions, covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge with or acquire other entities, dispose of assets, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our equity interests, engage in any material new line of business or enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement also includes financial covenants requiring minimum cash and cash equivalents balances and minimum revenues. To the extent we form or acquire certain subsidiaries domiciled in the United States, those subsidiaries are required to be guarantors of our obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the loan covenants.\nIn June 2013, we entered into a loan and security agreement as subsequently amended ( 2013 Loan Agreement\u201d) with a financial institution that provided for borrowings of up to $10.0 million in aggregate. Borrowings under the 2013 Loan Agreement totaled $5.0 million, which was outstanding at January 1, 2015 and into 2016 until such amount was repaid in full upon entering into the Credit Agreement discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Allegro in September 2014, we issued 964,377 shares of our common stock, paid $2.7 million in cash, settled in cash outstanding indebtedness of Allegro totaling $4.3 million, and paid severance and bonus to Allegro personnel of $1.2 million.\nWe expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, working capital and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to generate revenue to finance our cash requirements, we will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, borrowings or strategic collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third-party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our products or development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands of dollars):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $28.0 million. The net loss of $31.4 million includes non-cash charges of $0.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $6.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, $3.5 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.1 million of intangible asset amortization, $0.4 million from conversion of accrued interest to long-term debt and $0.3 million in interest and prepayment penalty relating to the repayment of our borrowings under our 2013 Loan Agreement. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.4 million is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $5.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.4 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $27.0 million. The net loss of $33.7 million includes non-cash charges of $1.9 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $5.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.3 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $0.8 million intangible asset amortization following the launch of Percepta in April 2015, $0.1 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.5 million was due to an increase of $0.9 million in deferred rent, accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily from deferred rent from the lease for our new South San Francisco facility, offset by $0.4 million from an increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and additional payers meeting our revenue recognition criteria for accrual.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $27.6 million. The net loss of $29.4 million includes non-cash charges of $2.3 million in amortization of the deferred fee received from Genzyme, offset primarily by $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.2 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and debt balloon interest expense, and $0.1 million of bad debt expense. The increase in net operating assets of $0.9 million was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to increases in Afirma adoption and new payers for whom revenue is recognized on an accrual basis, a $1.1 million increase in supplies inventory due to the increased volume of testing performed and a strategic decision to increase our inventory on hand, offset by a $2.2 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the timing of payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.7 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of $6.2 million used for the acquisition of property and equipment, primarily for the build out of office space and the new laboratory for our new South San Francisco facility and $0.5 million used as collateral for an irrevocable standby letter of credit as security for our new South San Francisco facility.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $9.0 million. The investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of $6.9 million of net cash used for the acquisition of Allegro, $2.0 million used for the purchase of laboratory equipment, software and leasehold improvements, and $0.1 million of restricted use cash to cover the hold-back liabilities associated with the acquisition of Allegro.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $52.3 million. The financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $31.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering, $24.5 million of net proceeds from the draw-down of the Initial Term Loan under the Credit Agreement and $1.2 million from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 million for the remaining principal balance and a $0.3 million of end-of-term payment and prepayment penalty related to the 2013 Loan Agreement that we repaid on March 30, 2016.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $37.7 million, consisting of $37.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a private placement and $0.7 million of cash received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.2 million spent on deferred stock offering costs related to our shelf registration statement.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $0.4 million consisted of $0.7 million we received from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock, offset by $0.1 million of IPO-related disbursements and a $0.1 million end-of-term payment on the 2013 Loan Agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands of dollars):\n\nIn December 2016, we entered into a capital lease for equipment which expires in December 2019.\nIn April 2015, we signed a non-cancelable lease agreement for approximately 59,000 square feet to serve as our new headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco. The lease began in June 2015 and expires in March 2026, and contains extension of lease term and expansion options.\nIn November 2012, we entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement commencing February 2013 for our laboratory and office space in Austin, Texas. The lease expires in July 2018.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments: (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt; (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods; (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans; (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans; (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated; and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for us beginning with our annual report for 2016 and interim periods thereafter. We have adopted this ASU and there is no impact on our financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to require debt issuance costs to be presented as an offset against debt outstanding. The update does not change current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective to each prior period presented. We adopted this ASU and the retrospective adjustment of the prior period presentation was not material.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position, thereby simplifying the guidance that required an entity to separate deferred assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts, and was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We early-adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015 and the impact of adoption on our statement of financial position was not material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases. This ASU is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. The ASU will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on our financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, Compensation - Stock Compensation, related to the tax effects of share-based awards. The ASU requires that all the tax effects of share-based awards be recorded through the income statement, thereby simplifying the current guidance that requires excess tax benefits and certain excess tax deficiencies to be recorded in equity. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash. This ASU requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The ASU will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on our financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase was driven by growth in Afirma test volume and additional payers meeting revenue recognition criteria. \n\n- Net loss in 2016 was $31.4 million compared to $33.7 million in 2015. The lower net loss was primarily due to increased revenue.\n\n- Operating expenses were $93.9 million in 2016, up 13% from 2015, driven by investments in R&D, sales and marketing, and infrastructure.\n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $28 million in 2016 compared to $27 million in 2015. Cash from financing activities was $52.3 million in 2016, mainly from a public offering and debt financing. \n\n- As of December 31, 2016, Veracyte had $59.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. \n\n- Key priorities include growing adoption of Afirma and launching new products like Percepta and Envisia to expand into lung cancer and interstitial lung diseases.\n\nIn summary, Veracyte reduced its net loss through revenue growth in 2016 and added cash to its balance sheet, though it continues to use cash for operations as it invests in its pipeline and infrastructure. The company is focused on growing its genomic testing business, particularly in thyroid and lung cancer detection."}
