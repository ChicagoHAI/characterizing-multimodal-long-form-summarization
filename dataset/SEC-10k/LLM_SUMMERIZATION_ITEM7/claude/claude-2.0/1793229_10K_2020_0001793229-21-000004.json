MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods.\nCompany Overview\nMultiPlan is a leading value-added provider of data analytics and technology-enabled end-to-end cost management, payment and revenue integrity solutions to the U.S. healthcare industry. We are also one of the largest independent PPOs in the U.S., with contracted providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We are committed to helping healthcare payors manage the cost of care, improve their competitiveness and inspire positive change. Leveraging sophisticated technology, data analytics and a team-rich industry experience, MultiPlan interprets clients' needs and customizes innovative solutions through the following offerings:\n\u2022Analytics-Based Services: data-driven algorithms which detect claims over-charges and recommend or negotiate fair reimbursement;\n\u2022Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers, including one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations in the United States, and outsourced network development and/or management services; and\n\u2022Payment Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.\nOur customers almost entirely are payors. We offer these payors a single electronic gateway to a comprehensive set of services in each of the three categories (Analytics-Based Services, Network-Based Services, and Payment Integrity Services), which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on healthcare payors and patients while fostering efficient payments to the providers. These offerings have enabled us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest commercial payors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our expansive network included access to over 1,200,000 healthcare providers and our comprehensive services identified approximately $18.8 billion in potential medical cost savings.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nThe Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the \"acquired\" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquiror. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (where were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transactions.\nAs a consequence of the Transactions, we became the successor to an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company acquired HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the\nbest use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The Company acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests of HST.\nThe results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. In connection with the HST acquisition, the Company incurred transaction costs. The transaction costs have been expensed as incurred and these amounts, totaling $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nUncertainty Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition during 2020. Effects from COVID-19 began to impact our business in first quarter 2020 with various federal, state, and local governments and private entities mandating restrictions on travel, restrictions on public gatherings, closure of non-essential commerce, and shelter in place orders. The Company experienced an approximately 4.6% decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to reduced volume from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services. The extent of the ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic. Future developments are highly uncertain, including the widespread availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence of highly contagious variants, and any actions taken by federal, state and local governments such as economic relief efforts, as well as U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns.\nWe have temporarily closed all of our offices and restricted travel due to concern for our employees' health and safety and also in compliance with state shelter in place orders. Most of our approximately 2,000 employees are working remotely. Other than these modifications, we have not experienced any material changes to our operations including receiving and processing transactions with our customers as a result of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly. We believe COVID-19's impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. COVID-19 will continue to impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition but it is uncertain if such impact will become more adverse or material as explained above.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and included certain changes to corporate income taxes. Specifically, the CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain payroll tax credits associated with the retention of employees. We assessed these impacts and noted the largest impact is due to the tax law change related to the interest disallowance rules retroactive to 2019. The other aspects of the CARES Act did not have a material effect on us. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nKey Technology\nOur strength as a company is our ability to use data and analytics to develop new service opportunities to enhance our customer relationships and to increase revenues. We use technology, data and analytics to transform healthcare transactions into multiple opportunities for savings and recurring revenues by leveraging data and analytics to inform our transaction processing systems (i.e., our claims processing systems). The transaction processing systems generate savings for our customers, revenues for us and each transaction adds more data to our intelligence engine and data warehouse. The intelligence engine drives our analytics and development of new saving opportunities and revenue growth through service enhancement or new product development.\nOur technology also contributes to our ability to efficiently process our transactions through EDI batch files, real time web services and online through customer and provider portals. We believe our current infrastructure can support significantly more than the current transaction volume giving us room for growth and increased volume. Our application platforms are architected and built with redundancy to eliminate downtime. All of the claims processed in our system are received via EDI or direct web service integration. As we process more claims through EDI and direct service integration, our electronic integration with customers results in substantial back office interconnectivity and considerably reduces complexity and processing failures.\nBecause we believe our transaction processing systems are scalable, we should be able to absorb significant increases in volume at minimal marginal costs. Our integration into our customers' systems and processes is an important component of our business model.\nMedical Cost Savings\nOur business and revenues are driven by the ability to lower medical costs through claims savings for our customers. The medical charges of those claims can influence our ability to generate claim savings.\nThe following table presents the medical charges processed and the potential savings identified for the periods presented:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical charges processed(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$105.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$106.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$101.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential medical cost savings(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$18.6 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________\n(1)Medical charges processed represents the aggregate dollar amount of claims processed by our cost management solutions in the period presented. The dollar amount of the claim for purposes of this calculation is the dollar amount of the claim prior to any reductions that may be made as a result of the claim being processed by our cost management solutions.\n(2)Potential medical cost savings represent the aggregate amount of potential savings in dollars identified by our cost management solutions in the period presented. Since certain of our fees are based on the amount of savings achieved by our customers and our customers are the final adjudicator of the claims and may choose not to reduce claims or reduce claims by only a portion of the potential savings identified, potential medical cost savings may not directly correlate with the amount of fees earned in connection with the processing of such claims.\nOur medical charges processed and potential medical cost savings figures may not be directly comparable from period to period due to the completion and integration of acquisitions made in a particular period.\nBusiness Model\nOur business model avoids reimbursement, underwriting and malpractice risk and exposure. We do not provide or manage healthcare services or provide medical care. This reduces our exposure to state and federal regulations that are imposed on insurers and medical services providers.\nHealthcare Industry Exposure\nAccording to CMS, healthcare expenditures will grow from $3.8 trillion, or 17.8% of U.S. GDP, in 2019 to represent 19.7% of GDP by 2028, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5%. There are a multitude of factors driving this expected growth, including recent regulations and ongoing secular trends, such as the aging population and other demographic factors, which are driving expanded healthcare coverage and increased utilization. Additional growth in healthcare costs are driven by availability of new medical technologies, therapies and modalities. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders and especially payors, are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve payment accuracy.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues from several sources including: (i) Analytics-Based Services that use our leading and proprietary information technology platform to offer customers solutions to reduce medical costs, (ii) Network-Based Services that process claims at a discount compared to billed fee-for-service rates and by using an extensive network and (iii) Payment Integrity Services that use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify improper, unnecessary and excessive charges. Payors compensate us through either a PSAV achieved or a PEPM rate.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) consist of all costs specifically associated with claims processing activities for customers, sales and marketing, and the development and maintenance of our networks, analytics-based solutions, and payment integrity solutions. Two of the largest components in costs of services are personnel\nexpenses and access and bill review fees. Access and bill review fees include fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, expenses associated with vendor fees for database access and systems technology used to reprice claims, and outsourced services. Third-party network expenses are fees paid to non-owned provider networks used to supplement our owned network assets to provide more network claim savings to our customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include corporate management and governance functions composed of general management, legal, treasury, tax, real estate, financial reporting, auditing, benefits and human resource administration, communications, public relations, billing and information management. In addition, general and administrative expenses include taxes, insurance, advertising, transaction costs, and other general expenses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment related to our investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment, computer hardware and software, and internally generated capitalized software development costs. We provide for depreciation and amortization on property and equipment using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of the value of our customer relationships and provider network which were identified in valuing the intangible assets in connection with the June 6, 2016 acquisition by H&F. The acquisition of HST contributed to an increase in intangibles of $32.2 million for customer relationships, trademarks, and technology.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists of accrued interest and related interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts on the Term Loan G, 7.125% Notes, 5.750% Notes and Senior Convertible PIK Notes and Senior PIK Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a $2.3 million out-of-period adjustment to recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to amounts of principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nInterest income\nInterest income consists primarily of bank interest.\nGain or loss on debt extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment of $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of:\n\u2022the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility as a result of which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs;\n\u2022the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million; and\n\u2022the redemption in full of the Senior PIK notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million Senior PIK Notes resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments consists of the changes in the fair value of the Company's investments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the loss of $12.2 million primarily results from the decrease in the fair value of the shares held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. The shares held in treasury were purchased in August 2020 for a total amount of\n$100.6 million excluding fees and commissions, and upon the consummation of the Transactions the fair value of the shares had decreased to $89.5 million.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense consists of federal, state, and local income taxes. Due to the variability of our taxable income as compared to net income, stock-based compensation and the variability of the jurisdictions where income is earned, our effective tax rate can vary significantly from one period to the next depending on relative changes in net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are financial measures that are not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our financial operating results of our core business.\nThese measurements of financial performance have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for any future replacement of depreciated assets;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of stock-based compensation upon our results of operations;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our income tax (benefit) expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from how we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in the presentation.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are widely used measures of corporate profitability eliminating the effects of financing and capital expenditures from the operating results. We define EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, interest income, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and non-income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core business, including other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, transaction related expenses, loss (gain) on the debt extinguishment, loss on investments and stock-based compensation. See our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness for debt covenant compliance purposes. Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation is consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in our debt instruments.\nAdjusted EPS is used in reporting to our Board and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Adjusted EPS is defined as net (loss) income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, transaction related expenses, loss on investments, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares and tax effect of adjustments to arrive at Adjusted net income divided by our weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and Polaris. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the best use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material.\nDebt Refinancings, Repayments and Repricing\nWe made several principal prepayments of the Term Loan G principal in the amounts of $369.0 million, $100.0 million and $245.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These prepayments reduce interest expense for Term Loan G for these and future time periods.\nIn connection with the issuance of our debt instruments, the Company incurred specific expenses related to raising the debt, including commissions, fees and expenses of investment bankers and underwriters, registration and listing fees, accounting and legal fees pertaining to the financing and other external, incremental expenses paid to advisors that were directly attributable to realizing the proceeds of the debt issues. These costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. The amortization of the debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the year-ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn October 8, 2020, the Company issued and sold $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Convertible PIK Notes. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes were issued with a 2.5% discount with a maturity date of October 15, 2027. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to six percent (6.00%) with respect to Cash Interest and seven percent (7.00%) with respect to PIK Interest. The Company must elect prior to the third business day prior to any interest payment date to pay Cash Interest or PIK Interest for such interest period; provided that prior to any such election, the Company is deemed to have selected Cash Interest.\nOn October 8, 2020, we redeemed the Senior PIK Notes in full at a redemption price of 102.000% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,237.6 million.\nOn October 29, 2020, MPH issued $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% Notes and redeemed the 7.125% Notes in full at a redemption price of 103.563% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,661.3 million. The Company also entered into an amendment to increase the commitments under its senior secured revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $450.0 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to the consummation of the Transactions, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and our stock-based compensation was granted to employees in the form of Units via a Class B Unit Award Agreement. See Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe consummation of the Transactions constituted a definitive Liquidity Event under the agreements governing the Unit awards and as a result all unvested Units vested on October 7, 2020 and the fair value of the outstanding Units were adjusted to the cumulative exit value of the Class B Units of $475.5 million, which reflects the transaction value plus prior distributions. The Company removed the discount for lack of marketability. Therefore, the Company recorded a stock-based compensation expense for Class B Units of $405.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded these awards\nwithin shareholders' equity as an equity contribution from Holdings based on the fair value of the outstanding Units at each reporting period. The settlement of these awards was made in a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock and was included in the aggregate consideration paid to the Company's owners.\nAfter the consummation of the Transactions, the Company operates under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan effective October 8, 2020. To date, awards granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan have been in the form of Employee RS and Director RSUs.\nThe Company granted 1,500,000 shares of Employee RS and 42,847 shares of Director RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan of $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was $13.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2020 related to the outstanding shares of Employee RS and Director RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years, 9 months.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nThe following table provides the results of operations for the periods

revenues of $982.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $45.1 million, or 4.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to decreases in Network Services revenues of $43.2 million and Payment Integrity revenues of $5.0 million, offset by increases in Analytics-Based Services revenues of $3.1 million, primarily due to reduced volumes of claims from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services related to COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Network Services revenues were $271.3 million as compared to $314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $43.2 million, or 13.8%. This decrease was primarily due to\ndeclines in overall claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions in medical services and restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services and declines in claims volumes from some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $564.7 million as compared to $561.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $3.1 million, or 0.6%. Increases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to overall increases in claims volumes from customers and due to some customers that moved their claims from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products, offset by decreases in claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions due in part to restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Payment Integrity Services were $101.8 million as compared to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.7%.

This increase was due to $70.8 million and $66.4 million purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $334.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense was $335.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $40.7 million, or 10.8%. The decrease in interest expense for this time period was due to lower term loan interest rates and a $369.0 million lower principal balance on the term loan in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in third quarter 2019. In addition, we refinanced our debt in October 2020, as explained below, resulting in overall lower annual interest providing interest savings of approximately $70 million. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt was $4,578.5 million and included (i) $2,341.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $3.8 million, (ii) $1,300.0 million of 5.750% Senior Notes, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior Convertible PIK Notes, discount on Senior Convertible PIK Notes of $329.5 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $29.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt had an annualized weighted average cash interest rate of 4.9%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $103.0 million as compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, redemption in full of the Senior PIK Notes, and the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility. The 7.125% Notes were redeemed in full on October 29, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million, and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million. The Senior PIK Notes were redeemed in full on October 8, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million. We repaid $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility on October 29, 2020 for which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in\nthe recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This loss is primarily the result of changes in the fair value of the 9,094,876 shares purchased by the Company and held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, this investment was accounted for as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, the fair value of the shares of $89.5 million was recorded as a reduction to shareholder's equity.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nNet loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $546.9 million generated a benefit for income taxes of $26.3 million with an effective tax rate of 4.8%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, non-deductible mark-to-market liability, changes in the Company's deferred state tax rate due to operations, and state tax expense.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $520.6 million as compared to net income of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income of $530.3 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $45.1 million, increases in costs of services of $169.1 million (of which $170.9 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation), increases in general and administrative expenses of $280.4 million (of which $250.0 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation and $28.4 million was due to increases in transaction costs), increases in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, and increases in amortization of intangible assets of $0.6 million, offset by decreases in interest expense of $40.7 million, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million, increases in the benefit for income taxes of $27.1 million and increases in interest income of $0.1 million as explained in the sections above.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended

</tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nN/M = Not meaningful\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $982.9 million as compared to revenues of $1,040.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $58.0 million, or 5.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to declines in Network Services revenues of $49.0 million and Analytics-Based Services revenues of $23.5 million, offset by growth in Payment Integrity Services revenues of $14.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Network Services revenues were $314.5 million as compared to $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $49.0 million, or 13.5%. This decrease was primarily due to declines in volumes of some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $561.5 million as compared to $585.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $23.5 million, or 4.0%. Decreases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to an aggregate decline in Analytics-Based Services claims and revenues as a result of a change in claims practice by certain customers beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This change in claims practice resulted in an approximately $50 to $60 million decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year; however, claims and revenue from such customers began to stabilize by the end of 2019. We also experienced slower than expected growth in our Analytics-Based Services for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from implementation issues at certain customers due to the need to revise their internal policies and/or update their end-user plan documentation.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $149.6 million, as compared to costs of services of $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. The increase in 2019 costs of services was primarily due to increases in other expenses of $1.0 million primarily due to increases in facilities expenses as a result of increases in office space rented and rent increases, offset by decreases in personnel expenses of $0.1 million and access and bill review fees of $0.7 million.\nPersonnel expenses, including contract labor, were $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $115.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $8.1 million, offset by increases in bonuses, commissions, and fringe benefits of $8.1 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nAccess and bill review fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $16.0 million, as compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.4%. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in network access fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, primarily due to reduced volume and a renegotiated agreement with one of our large leased networks.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $75.2 million as compared to $77.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.0%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $11.5 million, offset by increases in other personnel expenses of $9.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense was $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $3.5 million. This increase was due to $63.6 million of purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to our financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income, and Gain on Repurchase and Cancellation of Notes\nInterest expense was $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $6.9 million, or 1.8%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of the Senior PIK Notes as explained below and the combination of $100 million less term debt during most of 2019, as well as lower Term Loan G interest rates in the last half of 2019, offsetting higher interest rates that occurred in the first half of 2019, as compared to the comparable time periods in 2018. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. The write-off of debt issue costs and discount are included in interest expense. Interest income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to interest income of $51 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense attributable to the Senior PIK Notes, including the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, were $113.0 million and $115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had an annualized weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this\nerror as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt was $5,603.4 million and included (i) $2,810.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $7.8 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $12.3 million, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $10.6 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $60.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $44.3 million generated a provision for income taxes of $8.1 million with an effective tax rate of 18.3%. Our effective tax rate during the 2019 and 2018 periods differed from the statutory rate primarily due to stock-based compensation expense and state tax rates. In 2018, there was a $4.9 million one-time non-cash benefit due to a change in state tax rates.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was $9.7 million as compared to net income of $36.2 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net income of $26.5 million was primarily due to decreases in revenues of $58.0 million, increases in depreciation of $3.5 million, increase in costs of services of $0.1 million, offset by gain on the repurchase and cancellation of notes of $18.5 million, decreases in general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million, decreases in interest expense of $6.9 million, decreases in the provision for income taxes of $7.3 million, and increases in interest income of $0.1 million, as explained in the sections above. During 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $126.8 million and $450.0 million of loan availability under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the Refinancing, the commitments under the Revolver G were increased from $100.0 million to $450.0 million and $369.0 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan G were repaid. In March 2020, $98.0 million of borrowings were drawn on our Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21.8 million, three letters of credit totaling $1.8 million of utilization against the Revolver G and $98.2 million loan availability under Revolver G. The three letters of credit are used to satisfy real estate lease agreements for three of our offices in lieu of security deposits. We have the $1.8 million letters of credit as of December 31, 2020; however they are no longer utilized against the revolver.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds combined with our borrowing capacity under our Revolver G. We believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We may from time to time at our sole discretion, purchase, redeem or retire our long-term debt, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise. We plan to finance our capital expenditures with cash from operations. Furthermore, our future liquidity and future ability to fund capital expenditures, working capital and debt requirements are also dependent upon our future financial performance, which is subject to many economic, commercial, financial and other factors that are beyond our control, including the ability of financial institutions to meet their lending obligations to us. If those factors significantly change, our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to meet our liquidity needs. We anticipate that to the extent we require additional liquidity as a result of these factors or in order to execute our strategy, it would be financed either by borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, by other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of the foregoing. We may be unable to obtain any such additional financing on reasonable terms or at all.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292,303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(210,845) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,556) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61,599) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(201,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(245,150) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from operating activities provided $377.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This $93.1 million, or 32.7%, increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of increases in net income after adjusting for non-cash items of $69.4 million and changes in net working capital of $23.7 million.\nThe increase of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $69.4 million was due to an increase of non-cash items of $599.7 million partially offset by an increase in net loss of $530.3 million.\nThe $599.7 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $420.9 million, increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, change in the deferred tax benefit of $66.4 million, loss on investments of $12.2 million, and the increase in non-cash interest costs of $9.5 million including increases in debt issue costs, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, increase in amortization of intangible assets $0.6 million, and loss on disposal of assets of $0.4 million, offset by the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million and decrease in the amortization of right-of-use-asset of $1.2 million.\nThe increase in net loss of $530.3 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, increases in costs of services, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, and loss on debt extinguishment, offset by reductions in interest expense, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, increases in the benefit for income taxes, and increases in interest income as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $30.0 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $14.8 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, decreases in prepaid taxes of $2.1 million primarily due to a retrospective change in the tax law, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $13.6 million and accrued taxes of $9.8 million, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.5 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $8.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows from operating activities provided $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $8.0 million reduction in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of reductions in net income of $26.5 million adjusted for changes in non-cash items of $35.0 million, offset by changes in net working capital of $53.6 million. The reduction in net income of $26.5 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, and reductions in the provision for income taxes, as explained above. Changes in non-cash items are primarily due to changes in the gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, as explained above, and stock-based compensation as a result of the semi-annual valuation as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, $37.6 million was used by operating activities for changes to working capital, including decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $40.4 million and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.7 million, offset by decreases in net accounts receivable of $3.0 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and decreases in prepaid taxes of $4.4 million due to the impact of the TCJA in 2017 as explained below. Accounts payable and accrued expenses and other decreased $40.4 million primarily due to decreases in accrued interest of $3.8 million, accrued other liabilities of $8.4 million including administrative and network fees, and accrued compensation of $27.6 million resulting from reductions in employee bonuses, commissions, related fringe benefits and profit sharing in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash of $210.8 million was used in investing activities including $140.0 million for the acquisition of HST and $70.8 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development of $4.4 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash of $63.6 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $61.6 million primarily consisting of $369.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G, $1,615.6 million for the extinguishment of the 7.125% Notes, $1,202.3 million for extinguishment of the Senior PIK Notes, $682.4 million for the effect of the Transactions, $101.1 million for the purchase of treasury stock, and $23.5 million for the payment of debt issuance costs, offset by $1,267.5 million of cash provided by the issuance of Senior Convertible PIK Notes and $1,300.0 million of cash provided by the issuance of the 5.750% Notes. In addition, there was $98.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $245.2 million primarily consisting of $245.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G. In addition, there was $5.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nTerm Loans and Revolvers\nOn June 7, 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of us by affiliates of H&F, we borrowed $3,500.0 million with a group of lenders due and payable on June 7, 2023, creating the Term Loan G and settled all other outstanding term loans. We had a $100.0 million revolving credit facility in conjunction with Term Loan G. On March 19, 2020, we drew $98.0 million on Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nThe term loan and revolver are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property, including a pledge of all of the capital stock of each of our subsidiaries.\nTerm Loan G was refinanced on June 12, 2017 to lower the applicable margin on the interest rate by 1.00 % with terms otherwise similar to the former term loan, including a 2023 maturity and the same security and guarantee package. The proceeds of the new term loan were used to repay our existing term loan. As a result of the Term Loan G refinancing on June 12, 2017, and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of $20.1 million recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt, including the write off of $4.9 million of the term loan discount and $15.2 million of debt issuance costs. During the first quarter of 2018, we achieved a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate margin of Term Loan G due to an improved leverage ratio, resulting in a lower interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. These amounts are included in the loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOn July 2, 2020 the Company, the administrative agent and the revolving credit lenders agreed to amend the revolving credit facility maturity date to June 7, 2023, or September 1, 2022 should the aggregate principal outstanding on the Senior PIK Notes exceed $300 million on September 1, 2022.\nFor all our debt agreements with an interest rate dependent on LIBOR, we are currently assessing and monitoring how transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may affect us past 2023. See", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods.\nCompany Overview\nMultiPlan is a leading value-added provider of data analytics and technology-enabled end-to-end cost management, payment and revenue integrity solutions to the U.S. healthcare industry. We are also one of the largest independent PPOs in the U.S., with contracted providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We are committed to helping healthcare payors manage the cost of care, improve their competitiveness and inspire positive change. Leveraging sophisticated technology, data analytics and a team-rich industry experience, MultiPlan interprets clients' needs and customizes innovative solutions through the following offerings:\n\u2022Analytics-Based Services: data-driven algorithms which detect claims over-charges and recommend or negotiate fair reimbursement;\n\u2022Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers, including one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations in the United States, and outsourced network development and/or management services; and\n\u2022Payment Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.\nOur customers almost entirely are payors. We offer these payors a single electronic gateway to a comprehensive set of services in each of the three categories (Analytics-Based Services, Network-Based Services, and Payment Integrity Services), which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on healthcare payors and patients while fostering efficient payments to the providers. These offerings have enabled us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest commercial payors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our expansive network included access to over 1,200,000 healthcare providers and our comprehensive services identified approximately $18.8 billion in potential medical cost savings.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nThe Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the \"acquired\" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquiror. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (where were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transactions.\nAs a consequence of the Transactions, we became the successor to an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company acquired HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the\nbest use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The Company acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests of HST.\nThe results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. In connection with the HST acquisition, the Company incurred transaction costs. The transaction costs have been expensed as incurred and these amounts, totaling $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nUncertainty Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition during 2020. Effects from COVID-19 began to impact our business in first quarter 2020 with various federal, state, and local governments and private entities mandating restrictions on travel, restrictions on public gatherings, closure of non-essential commerce, and shelter in place orders. The Company experienced an approximately 4.6% decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to reduced volume from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services. The extent of the ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic. Future developments are highly uncertain, including the widespread availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence of highly contagious variants, and any actions taken by federal, state and local governments such as economic relief efforts, as well as U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns.\nWe have temporarily closed all of our offices and restricted travel due to concern for our employees' health and safety and also in compliance with state shelter in place orders. Most of our approximately 2,000 employees are working remotely. Other than these modifications, we have not experienced any material changes to our operations including receiving and processing transactions with our customers as a result of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly. We believe COVID-19's impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. COVID-19 will continue to impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition but it is uncertain if such impact will become more adverse or material as explained above.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and included certain changes to corporate income taxes. Specifically, the CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain payroll tax credits associated with the retention of employees. We assessed these impacts and noted the largest impact is due to the tax law change related to the interest disallowance rules retroactive to 2019. The other aspects of the CARES Act did not have a material effect on us. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nKey Technology\nOur strength as a company is our ability to use data and analytics to develop new service opportunities to enhance our customer relationships and to increase revenues. We use technology, data and analytics to transform healthcare transactions into multiple opportunities for savings and recurring revenues by leveraging data and analytics to inform our transaction processing systems (i.e., our claims processing systems). The transaction processing systems generate savings for our customers, revenues for us and each transaction adds more data to our intelligence engine and data warehouse. The intelligence engine drives our analytics and development of new saving opportunities and revenue growth through service enhancement or new product development.\nOur technology also contributes to our ability to efficiently process our transactions through EDI batch files, real time web services and online through customer and provider portals. We believe our current infrastructure can support significantly more than the current transaction volume giving us room for growth and increased volume. Our application platforms are architected and built with redundancy to eliminate downtime. All of the claims processed in our system are received via EDI or direct web service integration. As we process more claims through EDI and direct service integration, our electronic integration with customers results in substantial back office interconnectivity and considerably reduces complexity and processing failures.\nBecause we believe our transaction processing systems are scalable, we should be able to absorb significant increases in volume at minimal marginal costs. Our integration into our customers' systems and processes is an important component of our business model.\nMedical Cost Savings\nOur business and revenues are driven by the ability to lower medical costs through claims savings for our customers. The medical charges of those claims can influence our ability to generate claim savings.\nThe following table presents the medical charges processed and the potential savings identified for the periods presented:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical charges processed(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$105.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$106.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$101.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Potential medical cost savings(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$18.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$18.6 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________________________\n(1)Medical charges processed represents the aggregate dollar amount of claims processed by our cost management solutions in the period presented. The dollar amount of the claim for purposes of this calculation is the dollar amount of the claim prior to any reductions that may be made as a result of the claim being processed by our cost management solutions.\n(2)Potential medical cost savings represent the aggregate amount of potential savings in dollars identified by our cost management solutions in the period presented. Since certain of our fees are based on the amount of savings achieved by our customers and our customers are the final adjudicator of the claims and may choose not to reduce claims or reduce claims by only a portion of the potential savings identified, potential medical cost savings may not directly correlate with the amount of fees earned in connection with the processing of such claims.\nOur medical charges processed and potential medical cost savings figures may not be directly comparable from period to period due to the completion and integration of acquisitions made in a particular period.\nBusiness Model\nOur business model avoids reimbursement, underwriting and malpractice risk and exposure. We do not provide or manage healthcare services or provide medical care. This reduces our exposure to state and federal regulations that are imposed on insurers and medical services providers.\nHealthcare Industry Exposure\nAccording to CMS, healthcare expenditures will grow from $3.8 trillion, or 17.8% of U.S. GDP, in 2019 to represent 19.7% of GDP by 2028, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5%. There are a multitude of factors driving this expected growth, including recent regulations and ongoing secular trends, such as the aging population and other demographic factors, which are driving expanded healthcare coverage and increased utilization. Additional growth in healthcare costs are driven by availability of new medical technologies, therapies and modalities. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders and especially payors, are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve payment accuracy.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues from several sources including: (i) Analytics-Based Services that use our leading and proprietary information technology platform to offer customers solutions to reduce medical costs, (ii) Network-Based Services that process claims at a discount compared to billed fee-for-service rates and by using an extensive network and (iii) Payment Integrity Services that use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify improper, unnecessary and excessive charges. Payors compensate us through either a PSAV achieved or a PEPM rate.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) consist of all costs specifically associated with claims processing activities for customers, sales and marketing, and the development and maintenance of our networks, analytics-based solutions, and payment integrity solutions. Two of the largest components in costs of services are personnel\nexpenses and access and bill review fees. Access and bill review fees include fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, expenses associated with vendor fees for database access and systems technology used to reprice claims, and outsourced services. Third-party network expenses are fees paid to non-owned provider networks used to supplement our owned network assets to provide more network claim savings to our customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include corporate management and governance functions composed of general management, legal, treasury, tax, real estate, financial reporting, auditing, benefits and human resource administration, communications, public relations, billing and information management. In addition, general and administrative expenses include taxes, insurance, advertising, transaction costs, and other general expenses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment related to our investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment, computer hardware and software, and internally generated capitalized software development costs. We provide for depreciation and amortization on property and equipment using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of the value of our customer relationships and provider network which were identified in valuing the intangible assets in connection with the June 6, 2016 acquisition by H&F. The acquisition of HST contributed to an increase in intangibles of $32.2 million for customer relationships, trademarks, and technology.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists of accrued interest and related interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts on the Term Loan G, 7.125% Notes, 5.750% Notes and Senior Convertible PIK Notes and Senior PIK Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a $2.3 million out-of-period adjustment to recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to amounts of principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nInterest income\nInterest income consists primarily of bank interest.\nGain or loss on debt extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment of $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of:\n\u2022the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility as a result of which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs;\n\u2022the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million; and\n\u2022the redemption in full of the Senior PIK notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million Senior PIK Notes resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments consists of the changes in the fair value of the Company's investments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the loss of $12.2 million primarily results from the decrease in the fair value of the shares held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. The shares held in treasury were purchased in August 2020 for a total amount of\n$100.6 million excluding fees and commissions, and upon the consummation of the Transactions the fair value of the shares had decreased to $89.5 million.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense consists of federal, state, and local income taxes. Due to the variability of our taxable income as compared to net income, stock-based compensation and the variability of the jurisdictions where income is earned, our effective tax rate can vary significantly from one period to the next depending on relative changes in net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are financial measures that are not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our financial operating results of our core business.\nThese measurements of financial performance have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for any future replacement of depreciated assets;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of stock-based compensation upon our results of operations;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our income tax (benefit) expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from how we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in the presentation.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are widely used measures of corporate profitability eliminating the effects of financing and capital expenditures from the operating results. We define EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, interest income, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and non-income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core business, including other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, transaction related expenses, loss (gain) on the debt extinguishment, loss on investments and stock-based compensation. See our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness for debt covenant compliance purposes. Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation is consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in our debt instruments.\nAdjusted EPS is used in reporting to our Board and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Adjusted EPS is defined as net (loss) income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, transaction related expenses, loss on investments, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares and tax effect of adjustments to arrive at Adjusted net income divided by our weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and Polaris. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the best use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material.\nDebt Refinancings, Repayments and Repricing\nWe made several principal prepayments of the Term Loan G principal in the amounts of $369.0 million, $100.0 million and $245.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These prepayments reduce interest expense for Term Loan G for these and future time periods.\nIn connection with the issuance of our debt instruments, the Company incurred specific expenses related to raising the debt, including commissions, fees and expenses of investment bankers and underwriters, registration and listing fees, accounting and legal fees pertaining to the financing and other external, incremental expenses paid to advisors that were directly attributable to realizing the proceeds of the debt issues. These costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. The amortization of the debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the year-ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn October 8, 2020, the Company issued and sold $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Convertible PIK Notes. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes were issued with a 2.5% discount with a maturity date of October 15, 2027. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to six percent (6.00%) with respect to Cash Interest and seven percent (7.00%) with respect to PIK Interest. The Company must elect prior to the third business day prior to any interest payment date to pay Cash Interest or PIK Interest for such interest period; provided that prior to any such election, the Company is deemed to have selected Cash Interest.\nOn October 8, 2020, we redeemed the Senior PIK Notes in full at a redemption price of 102.000% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,237.6 million.\nOn October 29, 2020, MPH issued $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% Notes and redeemed the 7.125% Notes in full at a redemption price of 103.563% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,661.3 million. The Company also entered into an amendment to increase the commitments under its senior secured revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $450.0 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to the consummation of the Transactions, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and our stock-based compensation was granted to employees in the form of Units via a Class B Unit Award Agreement. See Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe consummation of the Transactions constituted a definitive Liquidity Event under the agreements governing the Unit awards and as a result all unvested Units vested on October 7, 2020 and the fair value of the outstanding Units were adjusted to the cumulative exit value of the Class B Units of $475.5 million, which reflects the transaction value plus prior distributions. The Company removed the discount for lack of marketability. Therefore, the Company recorded a stock-based compensation expense for Class B Units of $405.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded these awards\nwithin shareholders' equity as an equity contribution from Holdings based on the fair value of the outstanding Units at each reporting period. The settlement of these awards was made in a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock and was included in the aggregate consideration paid to the Company's owners.\nAfter the consummation of the Transactions, the Company operates under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan effective October 8, 2020. To date, awards granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan have been in the form of Employee RS and Director RSUs.\nThe Company granted 1,500,000 shares of Employee RS and 42,847 shares of Director RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan of $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was $13.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2020 related to the outstanding shares of Employee RS and Director RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years, 9 months.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nThe following table provides the results of operations for the periods

revenues of $982.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $45.1 million, or 4.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to decreases in Network Services revenues of $43.2 million and Payment Integrity revenues of $5.0 million, offset by increases in Analytics-Based Services revenues of $3.1 million, primarily due to reduced volumes of claims from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services related to COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Network Services revenues were $271.3 million as compared to $314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $43.2 million, or 13.8%. This decrease was primarily due to\ndeclines in overall claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions in medical services and restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services and declines in claims volumes from some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $564.7 million as compared to $561.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $3.1 million, or 0.6%. Increases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to overall increases in claims volumes from customers and due to some customers that moved their claims from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products, offset by decreases in claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions due in part to restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Payment Integrity Services were $101.8 million as compared to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.7%. This decrease was primarily due to reduction in overall claim volume due to COVID-19 restrictions on elective procedures and non-essential medical services.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>318,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>169,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: stock-based compensation </td> <td>163,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,904) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of services excluding stock-based compensation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,861) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $318.7 million as compared to costs of services of $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $169.1 million, or 113.0%. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of $175.4 million related to stock-based compensation as explained below, offset by decreases in access and bill review fees of $2.2 million and decreases in other expenses of $4.2 million.\nPersonnel expenses, including contract labor, were $291.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $175.4 million, or 151.5%.

This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of $250.6 million primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation of $250.0 million and increases in transaction costs of $28.4 million. The increases in transactions costs of $28.4 million were primarily due to costs associated with the Transactions on October 8, 2020 and acquisition of HST on November 9, 2020. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense was $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $4.8 million, or 8.5%. This increase was due to $70.8 million and $66.4 million purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $334.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense was $335.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $40.7 million, or 10.8%. The decrease in interest expense for this time period was due to lower term loan interest rates and a $369.0 million lower principal balance on the term loan in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in third quarter 2019. In addition, we refinanced our debt in October 2020, as explained below, resulting in overall lower annual interest providing interest savings of approximately $70 million. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt was $4,578.5 million and included (i) $2,341.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $3.8 million, (ii) $1,300.0 million of 5.750% Senior Notes, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior Convertible PIK Notes, discount on Senior Convertible PIK Notes of $329.5 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $29.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt had an annualized weighted average cash interest rate of 4.9%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $103.0 million as compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, redemption in full of the Senior PIK Notes, and the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility. The 7.125% Notes were redeemed in full on October 29, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million, and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million. The Senior PIK Notes were redeemed in full on October 8, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million. We repaid $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility on October 29, 2020 for which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in\nthe recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This loss is primarily the result of changes in the fair value of the 9,094,876 shares purchased by the Company and held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, this investment was accounted for as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, the fair value of the shares of $89.5 million was recorded as a reduction to shareholder's equity.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nNet loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $546.9 million generated a benefit for income taxes of $26.3 million with an effective tax rate of 4.8%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, non-deductible mark-to-market liability, changes in the Company's deferred state tax rate due to operations, and state tax expense.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $520.6 million as compared to net income of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income of $530.3 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $45.1 million, increases in costs of services of $169.1 million (of which $170.9 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation), increases in general and administrative expenses of $280.4 million (of which $250.0 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation and $28.4 million was due to increases in transaction costs), increases in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, and increases in amortization of intangible assets of $0.6 million, offset by decreases in interest expense of $40.7 million, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million, increases in the benefit for income taxes of $27.1 million and increases in interest income of $0.1 million as explained in the sections above.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended

December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $58.0 million, or 5.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to declines in Network Services revenues of $49.0 million and Analytics-Based Services revenues of $23.5 million, offset by growth in Payment Integrity Services revenues of $14.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Network Services revenues were $314.5 million as compared to $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $49.0 million, or 13.5%. This decrease was primarily due to declines in volumes of some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $561.5 million as compared to $585.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $23.5 million, or 4.0%. Decreases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to an aggregate decline in Analytics-Based Services claims and revenues as a result of a change in claims practice by certain customers beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This change in claims practice resulted in an approximately $50 to $60 million decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year; however, claims and revenue from such customers began to stabilize by the end of 2019. We also experienced slower than expected growth in our Analytics-Based Services for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from implementation issues at certain customers due to the need to revise their internal policies and/or update their end-user plan documentation.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $149.6 million, as compared to costs of services of $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. The increase in 2019 costs of services was primarily due to increases in other expenses of $1.0 million primarily due to increases in facilities expenses as a result of increases in office space rented and rent increases, offset by decreases in personnel expenses of $0.1 million and access and bill review fees of $0.7 million.\nPersonnel expenses, including contract labor, were $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $115.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $8.1 million, offset by increases in bonuses, commissions, and fringe benefits of $8.1 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nAccess and bill review fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $16.0 million, as compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.4%. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in network access fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, primarily due to reduced volume and a renegotiated agreement with one of our large leased networks.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $75.2 million as compared to $77.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.0%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $11.5 million, offset by increases in other personnel expenses of $9.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense was $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $3.5 million. This increase was due to $63.6 million of purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to our financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income, and Gain on Repurchase and Cancellation of Notes\nInterest expense was $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $6.9 million, or 1.8%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of the Senior PIK Notes as explained below and the combination of $100 million less term debt during most of 2019, as well as lower Term Loan G interest rates in the last half of 2019, offsetting higher interest rates that occurred in the first half of 2019, as compared to the comparable time periods in 2018. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. The write-off of debt issue costs and discount are included in interest expense. Interest income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to interest income of $51 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense attributable to the Senior PIK Notes, including the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, were $113.0 million and $115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had an annualized weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this\nerror as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt was $5,603.4 million and included (i) $2,810.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $7.8 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $12.3 million, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $10.6 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $60.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $44.3 million generated a provision for income taxes of $8.1 million with an effective tax rate of 18.3%. Our effective tax rate during the 2019 and 2018 periods differed from the statutory rate primarily due to stock-based compensation expense and state tax rates. In 2018, there was a $4.9 million one-time non-cash benefit due to a change in state tax rates.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was $9.7 million as compared to net income of $36.2 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net income of $26.5 million was primarily due to decreases in revenues of $58.0 million, increases in depreciation of $3.5 million, increase in costs of services of $0.1 million, offset by gain on the repurchase and cancellation of notes of $18.5 million, decreases in general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million, decreases in interest expense of $6.9 million, decreases in the provision for income taxes of $7.3 million, and increases in interest income of $0.1 million, as explained in the sections above. During 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $126.8 million and $450.0 million of loan availability under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the Refinancing, the commitments under the Revolver G were increased from $100.0 million to $450.0 million and $369.0 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan G were repaid. In March 2020, $98.0 million of borrowings were drawn on our Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21.8 million, three letters of credit totaling $1.8 million of utilization against the Revolver G and $98.2 million loan availability under Revolver G. The three letters of credit are used to satisfy real estate lease agreements for three of our offices in lieu of security deposits. We have the $1.8 million letters of credit as of December 31, 2020; however they are no longer utilized against the revolver.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds combined with our borrowing capacity under our Revolver G. We believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We may from time to time at our sole discretion, purchase, redeem or retire our long-term debt, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise. We plan to finance our capital expenditures with cash from operations. Furthermore, our future liquidity and future ability to fund capital expenditures, working capital and debt requirements are also dependent upon our future financial performance, which is subject to many economic, commercial, financial and other factors that are beyond our control, including the ability of financial institutions to meet their lending obligations to us. If those factors significantly change, our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to meet our liquidity needs. We anticipate that to the extent we require additional liquidity as a result of these factors or in order to execute our strategy, it would be financed either by borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, by other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of the foregoing. We may be unable to obtain any such additional financing on reasonable terms or at all.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>377,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292,303 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(210,845) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63,556) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61,599) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(201,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(245,150) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from operating activities provided $377.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This $93.1 million, or 32.7%, increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of increases in net income after adjusting for non-cash items of $69.4 million and changes in net working capital of $23.7 million.\nThe increase of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $69.4 million was due to an increase of non-cash items of $599.7 million partially offset by an increase in net loss of $530.3 million.\nThe $599.7 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $420.9 million, increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, change in the deferred tax benefit of $66.4 million, loss on investments of $12.2 million, and the increase in non-cash interest costs of $9.5 million including increases in debt issue costs, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, increase in amortization of intangible assets $0.6 million, and loss on disposal of assets of $0.4 million, offset by the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million and decrease in the amortization of right-of-use-asset of $1.2 million.\nThe increase in net loss of $530.3 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, increases in costs of services, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, and loss on debt extinguishment, offset by reductions in interest expense, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, increases in the benefit for income taxes, and increases in interest income as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $30.0 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $14.8 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, decreases in prepaid taxes of $2.1 million primarily due to a retrospective change in the tax law, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $13.6 million and accrued taxes of $9.8 million, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.5 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $8.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows from operating activities provided $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $8.0 million reduction in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of reductions in net income of $26.5 million adjusted for changes in non-cash items of $35.0 million, offset by changes in net working capital of $53.6 million. The reduction in net income of $26.5 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, and reductions in the provision for income taxes, as explained above. Changes in non-cash items are primarily due to changes in the gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, as explained above, and stock-based compensation as a result of the semi-annual valuation as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, $37.6 million was used by operating activities for changes to working capital, including decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $40.4 million and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.7 million, offset by decreases in net accounts receivable of $3.0 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and decreases in prepaid taxes of $4.4 million due to the impact of the TCJA in 2017 as explained below. Accounts payable and accrued expenses and other decreased $40.4 million primarily due to decreases in accrued interest of $3.8 million, accrued other liabilities of $8.4 million including administrative and network fees, and accrued compensation of $27.6 million resulting from reductions in employee bonuses, commissions, related fringe benefits and profit sharing in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash of $210.8 million was used in investing activities including $140.0 million for the acquisition of HST and $70.8 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development of $4.4 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash of $63.6 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $61.6 million primarily consisting of $369.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G, $1,615.6 million for the extinguishment of the 7.125% Notes, $1,202.3 million for extinguishment of the Senior PIK Notes, $682.4 million for the effect of the Transactions, $101.1 million for the purchase of treasury stock, and $23.5 million for the payment of debt issuance costs, offset by $1,267.5 million of cash provided by the issuance of Senior Convertible PIK Notes and $1,300.0 million of cash provided by the issuance of the 5.750% Notes. In addition, there was $98.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $245.2 million primarily consisting of $245.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G. In addition, there was $5.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nTerm Loans and Revolvers\nOn June 7, 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of us by affiliates of H&F, we borrowed $3,500.0 million with a group of lenders due and payable on June 7, 2023, creating the Term Loan G and settled all other outstanding term loans. We had a $100.0 million revolving credit facility in conjunction with Term Loan G. On March 19, 2020, we drew $98.0 million on Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nThe term loan and revolver are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property, including a pledge of all of the capital stock of each of our subsidiaries.\nTerm Loan G was refinanced on June 12, 2017 to lower the applicable margin on the interest rate by 1.00 % with terms otherwise similar to the former term loan, including a 2023 maturity and the same security and guarantee package. The proceeds of the new term loan were used to repay our existing term loan. As a result of the Term Loan G refinancing on June 12, 2017, and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of $20.1 million recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt, including the write off of $4.9 million of the term loan discount and $15.2 million of debt issuance costs. During the first quarter of 2018, we achieved a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate margin of Term Loan G due to an improved leverage ratio, resulting in a lower interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. These amounts are included in the loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOn July 2, 2020 the Company, the administrative agent and the revolving credit lenders agreed to amend the revolving credit facility maturity date to June 7, 2023, or September 1, 2022 should the aggregate principal outstanding on the Senior PIK Notes exceed $300 million on September 1, 2022.\nFor all our debt agreements with an interest rate dependent on LIBOR, we are currently assessing and monitoring how transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may affect us past 2023. See", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods.\nCompany Overview\nMultiPlan is a leading value-added provider of data analytics and technology-enabled end-to-end cost management, payment and revenue integrity solutions to the U.S. healthcare industry. We are also one of the largest independent PPOs in the U.S., with contracted providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We are committed to helping healthcare payors manage the cost of care, improve their competitiveness and inspire positive change. Leveraging sophisticated technology, data analytics and a team-rich industry experience, MultiPlan interprets clients' needs and customizes innovative solutions through the following offerings:\n\u2022Analytics-Based Services: data-driven algorithms which detect claims over-charges and recommend or negotiate fair reimbursement;\n\u2022Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers, including one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations in the United States, and outsourced network development and/or management services; and\n\u2022Payment Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.\nOur customers almost entirely are payors. We offer these payors a single electronic gateway to a comprehensive set of services in each of the three categories (Analytics-Based Services, Network-Based Services, and Payment Integrity Services), which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on healthcare payors and patients while fostering efficient payments to the providers. These offerings have enabled us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest commercial payors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our expansive network included access to over 1,200,000 healthcare providers and our comprehensive services identified approximately $18.8 billion in potential medical cost savings.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nThe Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the \"acquired\" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquiror. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (where were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transactions.\nAs a consequence of the Transactions, we became the successor to an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company acquired HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the\nbest use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The Company acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests of HST.\nThe results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. In connection with the HST acquisition, the Company incurred transaction costs. The transaction costs have been expensed as incurred and these amounts, totaling $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nUncertainty Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition during 2020. Effects from COVID-19 began to impact our business in first quarter 2020 with various federal, state, and local governments and private entities mandating restrictions on travel, restrictions on public gatherings, closure of non-essential commerce, and shelter in place orders. The Company experienced an approximately 4.6% decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to reduced volume from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services. The extent of the ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic. Future developments are highly uncertain, including the widespread availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence of highly contagious variants, and any actions taken by federal, state and local governments such as economic relief efforts, as well as U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns.\nWe have temporarily closed all of our offices and restricted travel due to concern for our employees' health and safety and also in compliance with state shelter in place orders. Most of our approximately 2,000 employees are working remotely. Other than these modifications, we have not experienced any material changes to our operations including receiving and processing transactions with our customers as a result of COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly. We believe COVID-19's impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of stimulus legislation as well as other federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control. COVID-19 will continue to impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition but it is uncertain if such impact will become more adverse or material as explained above.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 and included certain changes to corporate income taxes. Specifically, the CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain payroll tax credits associated with the retention of employees. We assessed these impacts and noted the largest impact is due to the tax law change related to the interest disallowance rules retroactive to 2019. The other aspects of the CARES Act did not have a material effect on us. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nKey Technology\nOur strength as a company is our ability to use data and analytics to develop new service opportunities to enhance our customer relationships and to increase revenues. We use technology, data and analytics to transform healthcare transactions into multiple opportunities for savings and recurring revenues by leveraging data and analytics to inform our transaction processing systems (i.e., our claims processing systems). The transaction processing systems generate savings for our customers, revenues for us and each transaction adds more data to our intelligence engine and data warehouse. The intelligence engine drives our analytics and development of new saving opportunities and revenue growth through service enhancement or new product development.\nOur technology also contributes to our ability to efficiently process our transactions through EDI batch files, real time web services and online through customer and provider portals. We believe our current infrastructure can support significantly more than the current transaction volume giving us room for growth and increased volume. Our application platforms are architected and built with redundancy to eliminate downtime. All of the claims processed in our system are received via EDI or direct web service integration. As we process more claims through EDI and direct service integration, our electronic integration with customers results in substantial back office interconnectivity and considerably reduces complexity and processing failures.\nBecause we believe our transaction processing systems are scalable, we should be able to absorb significant increases in volume at minimal marginal costs. Our integration into our customers' systems and processes is an important component of our business model.\nMedical Cost Savings\nOur business and revenues are driven by the ability to lower medical costs through claims savings for our customers. The medical charges of those claims can influence our ability to generate claim savings.\nThe following table presents the medical charges processed and the potential savings identified for the periods presented:\n\n_____________________________\n(1)Medical charges processed represents the aggregate dollar amount of claims processed by our cost management solutions in the period presented. The dollar amount of the claim for purposes of this calculation is the dollar amount of the claim prior to any reductions that may be made as a result of the claim being processed by our cost management solutions.\n(2)Potential medical cost savings represent the aggregate amount of potential savings in dollars identified by our cost management solutions in the period presented. Since certain of our fees are based on the amount of savings achieved by our customers and our customers are the final adjudicator of the claims and may choose not to reduce claims or reduce claims by only a portion of the potential savings identified, potential medical cost savings may not directly correlate with the amount of fees earned in connection with the processing of such claims.\nOur medical charges processed and potential medical cost savings figures may not be directly comparable from period to period due to the completion and integration of acquisitions made in a particular period.\nBusiness Model\nOur business model avoids reimbursement, underwriting and malpractice risk and exposure. We do not provide or manage healthcare services or provide medical care. This reduces our exposure to state and federal regulations that are imposed on insurers and medical services providers.\nHealthcare Industry Exposure\nAccording to CMS, healthcare expenditures will grow from $3.8 trillion, or 17.8% of U.S. GDP, in 2019 to represent 19.7% of GDP by 2028, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5%. There are a multitude of factors driving this expected growth, including recent regulations and ongoing secular trends, such as the aging population and other demographic factors, which are driving expanded healthcare coverage and increased utilization. Additional growth in healthcare costs are driven by availability of new medical technologies, therapies and modalities. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders and especially payors, are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve payment accuracy.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues from several sources including: (i) Analytics-Based Services that use our leading and proprietary information technology platform to offer customers solutions to reduce medical costs, (ii) Network-Based Services that process claims at a discount compared to billed fee-for-service rates and by using an extensive network and (iii) Payment Integrity Services that use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify improper, unnecessary and excessive charges. Payors compensate us through either a PSAV achieved or a PEPM rate.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) consist of all costs specifically associated with claims processing activities for customers, sales and marketing, and the development and maintenance of our networks, analytics-based solutions, and payment integrity solutions. Two of the largest components in costs of services are personnel\nexpenses and access and bill review fees. Access and bill review fees include fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, expenses associated with vendor fees for database access and systems technology used to reprice claims, and outsourced services. Third-party network expenses are fees paid to non-owned provider networks used to supplement our owned network assets to provide more network claim savings to our customers.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include corporate management and governance functions composed of general management, legal, treasury, tax, real estate, financial reporting, auditing, benefits and human resource administration, communications, public relations, billing and information management. In addition, general and administrative expenses include taxes, insurance, advertising, transaction costs, and other general expenses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense consists of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment related to our investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment, computer hardware and software, and internally generated capitalized software development costs. We provide for depreciation and amortization on property and equipment using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets includes amortization of the value of our customer relationships and provider network which were identified in valuing the intangible assets in connection with the June 6, 2016 acquisition by H&F. The acquisition of HST contributed to an increase in intangibles of $32.2 million for customer relationships, trademarks, and technology.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists of accrued interest and related interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts on the Term Loan G, 7.125% Notes, 5.750% Notes and Senior Convertible PIK Notes and Senior PIK Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 included a $2.3 million out-of-period adjustment to recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to amounts of principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nInterest income\nInterest income consists primarily of bank interest.\nGain or loss on debt extinguishment\nThe loss on debt extinguishment of $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of:\n\u2022the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility as a result of which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs;\n\u2022the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million; and\n\u2022the redemption in full of the Senior PIK notes, for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million Senior PIK Notes resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments consists of the changes in the fair value of the Company's investments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the loss of $12.2 million primarily results from the decrease in the fair value of the shares held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. The shares held in treasury were purchased in August 2020 for a total amount of\n$100.6 million excluding fees and commissions, and upon the consummation of the Transactions the fair value of the shares had decreased to $89.5 million.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense consists of federal, state, and local income taxes. Due to the variability of our taxable income as compared to net income, stock-based compensation and the variability of the jurisdictions where income is earned, our effective tax rate can vary significantly from one period to the next depending on relative changes in net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are financial measures that are not presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our financial operating results of our core business.\nThese measurements of financial performance have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for any future replacement of depreciated assets;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of stock-based compensation upon our results of operations;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect our income tax (benefit) expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes;\n\u2022such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and\n\u2022other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from how we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in the presentation.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are widely used measures of corporate profitability eliminating the effects of financing and capital expenditures from the operating results. We define EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, interest income, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and non-income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core business, including other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, transaction related expenses, loss (gain) on the debt extinguishment, loss on investments and stock-based compensation. See our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness for debt covenant compliance purposes. Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation is consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in our debt instruments.\nAdjusted EPS is used in reporting to our Board and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. Adjusted EPS is defined as net (loss) income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, transaction related expenses, loss on investments, loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, other expense, change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares and tax effect of adjustments to arrive at Adjusted net income divided by our weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n____________________\n(a)Please see the section entitled \"Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations - Debt Refinancings, Repayments and Repricing\" for more information. Interest expense for MultiPlan Corporation is $107.2 million higher than interest expense for MPH due to interest expense incurred by MultiPlan Corporation on $1,178.7 million Senior PIK Notes (redeemed October 8, 2020) including amortization of discount on Senior PIK Notes and interest on $1,300.0 million Senior Convertible PIK Notes (issued on October 8, 2020), net of debt issue costs.\n(b)Income tax benefit for MultiPlan Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $28.1 million higher than the income tax provision for MPH due to differences in net loss before income taxes.\n(c)Non-income taxes includes personal property taxes, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes and franchise taxes which are included in cost of services and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\n(d)Represents miscellaneous expenses, gain or loss on disposal of assets, gain or loss on disposal of leases, tax penalties, management fees, and costs associated with the integration of acquired companies into MultiPlan.\n(e)For the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over\nthat period. MultiPlan Corporation's change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares is $35.4 million higher than MPH as a result.\n(f)Represents ordinary course transaction costs, including transaction costs related to the Transactions, the acquisition of HST and the acquisition of DHP.\n(g)Loss on investments primarily includes the change in fair value of shares purchased prior to the Transactions. These shares are now held in treasury. See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MultiPlan Corporation's loss on investments is $11.5 million higher than MPH as a result of the change in value as of such date of such treasury shares.\n(h)Represents the 2019 gain related to the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior PIK Notes and the 2020 loss on debt extinguishment related to the prepayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility, redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes on October 29, 2020 and redemption in full of the remaining Senior PIK Notes on October 8, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MultiPlan Corporation's loss on debt extinguishment is $35.7 million higher than MPH due to the redemption of the Senior PIK Notes on October 8, 2020.\n(i)Includes the cost of our employee and non-employee director stock-based compensation plans. Please see the section entitled \"Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations - Stock-Based Compensation\" for additional information.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EPS for the periods presented:\n\n____________________\n(1) The shares of the Company's common stock, prior to the Transactions, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Transactions.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations\nAs a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods and may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations.\nThe Transactions\nOn July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and Polaris. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed.\nHST Acquisition\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the best use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The results of operations and financial condition of HST have been included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2020, HST's impact on revenues and net earnings was not material.\nDebt Refinancings, Repayments and Repricing\nWe made several principal prepayments of the Term Loan G principal in the amounts of $369.0 million, $100.0 million and $245.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These prepayments reduce interest expense for Term Loan G for these and future time periods.\nIn connection with the issuance of our debt instruments, the Company incurred specific expenses related to raising the debt, including commissions, fees and expenses of investment bankers and underwriters, registration and listing fees, accounting and legal fees pertaining to the financing and other external, incremental expenses paid to advisors that were directly attributable to realizing the proceeds of the debt issues. These costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. The amortization of the debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income.\nDuring the year-ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn October 8, 2020, the Company issued and sold $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Convertible PIK Notes. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes were issued with a 2.5% discount with a maturity date of October 15, 2027. The Senior Convertible PIK Notes will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to six percent (6.00%) with respect to Cash Interest and seven percent (7.00%) with respect to PIK Interest. The Company must elect prior to the third business day prior to any interest payment date to pay Cash Interest or PIK Interest for such interest period; provided that prior to any such election, the Company is deemed to have selected Cash Interest.\nOn October 8, 2020, we redeemed the Senior PIK Notes in full at a redemption price of 102.000% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,237.6 million.\nOn October 29, 2020, MPH issued $1,300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% Notes and redeemed the 7.125% Notes in full at a redemption price of 103.563% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest for a total redemption price of $1,661.3 million. The Company also entered into an amendment to increase the commitments under its senior secured revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $450.0 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nPrior to the consummation of the Transactions, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and our stock-based compensation was granted to employees in the form of Units via a Class B Unit Award Agreement. See Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe consummation of the Transactions constituted a definitive Liquidity Event under the agreements governing the Unit awards and as a result all unvested Units vested on October 7, 2020 and the fair value of the outstanding Units were adjusted to the cumulative exit value of the Class B Units of $475.5 million, which reflects the transaction value plus prior distributions. The Company removed the discount for lack of marketability. Therefore, the Company recorded a stock-based compensation expense for Class B Units of $405.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded these awards\nwithin shareholders' equity as an equity contribution from Holdings based on the fair value of the outstanding Units at each reporting period. The settlement of these awards was made in a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock and was included in the aggregate consideration paid to the Company's owners.\nAfter the consummation of the Transactions, the Company operates under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan effective October 8, 2020. To date, awards granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan have been in the form of Employee RS and Director RSUs.\nThe Company granted 1,500,000 shares of Employee RS and 42,847 shares of Director RSUs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan of $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was $13.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2020 related to the outstanding shares of Employee RS and Director RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years, 9 months.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nThe following table provides the results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\nNM = Not Meaningful\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $937.8 million as compared to revenues of $982.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $45.1 million, or 4.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to decreases in Network Services revenues of $43.2 million and Payment Integrity revenues of $5.0 million, offset by increases in Analytics-Based Services revenues of $3.1 million, primarily due to reduced volumes of claims from customers as a result of restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services related to COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Network Services revenues were $271.3 million as compared to $314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $43.2 million, or 13.8%. This decrease was primarily due to\ndeclines in overall claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions in medical services and restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services and declines in claims volumes from some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $564.7 million as compared to $561.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $3.1 million, or 0.6%. Increases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to overall increases in claims volumes from customers and due to some customers that moved their claims from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products, offset by decreases in claims volume due to COVID-19 related reductions due in part to restrictions on elective medical procedures and non-essential medical services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from our Payment Integrity Services were $101.8 million as compared to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.7%. This decrease was primarily due to reduction in overall claim volume due to COVID-19 restrictions on elective procedures and non-essential medical services.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\n\nCosts of services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $318.7 million as compared to costs of services of $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $169.1 million, or 113.0%. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of $175.4 million related to stock-based compensation as explained below, offset by decreases in access and bill review fees of $2.2 million and decreases in other expenses of $4.2 million.\nPersonnel expenses, including contract labor, were $291.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $175.4 million, or 151.5%. This increase was primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation of $170.9 million and net increases in other compensation related expenses, including salaries, commissions, and fringe benefits of $4.5 million.\nAccess and bill review fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $13.8 million, as compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $2.2 million, or 13.8%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in claims volumes resulting in decreases in network access fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks of $1.0 million and reductions in claims processing fees of $1.2 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $355.6 million as compared to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $280.4 million, or 372.8%. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of $250.6 million primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation of $250.0 million and increases in transaction costs of $28.4 million. The increases in transactions costs of $28.4 million were primarily due to costs associated with the Transactions on October 8, 2020 and acquisition of HST on November 9, 2020. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense was $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of $4.8 million, or 8.5%. This increase was due to $70.8 million and $66.4 million purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $334.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense was $335.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $40.7 million, or 10.8%. The decrease in interest expense for this time period was due to lower term loan interest rates and a $369.0 million lower principal balance on the term loan in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in third quarter 2019. In addition, we refinanced our debt in October 2020, as explained below, resulting in overall lower annual interest providing interest savings of approximately $70 million. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this error as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our long-term debt was $4,578.5 million and included (i) $2,341.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $3.8 million, (ii) $1,300.0 million of 5.750% Senior Notes, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior Convertible PIK Notes, discount on Senior Convertible PIK Notes of $329.5 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $29.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt had an annualized weighted average cash interest rate of 4.9%.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLoss (gain) on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $103.0 million as compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of the redemption in full of the 7.125% Notes, redemption in full of the Senior PIK Notes, and the repayment of $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility. The 7.125% Notes were redeemed in full on October 29, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $55.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.0 million, and the unamortized debt premium of $8.6 million. The Senior PIK Notes were redeemed in full on October 8, 2020 for which we paid a redemption premium of $23.6 million and wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs of $6.5 million and the unamortized debt discount of $5.7 million. We repaid $369.0 million of indebtedness under our term loan facility on October 29, 2020 for which we wrote off $0.6 million of the term loan discount and $1.6 million of debt issuance costs.\nThe gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 consists of the $18.5 million gain on the repurchase and cancellation of $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes in 2019. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million resulted in\nthe recognition of a gain of $18.5 million as well as a write off of the pro-rate share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million.\nLoss on investments\nLoss on investments was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This loss is primarily the result of changes in the fair value of the 9,094,876 shares purchased by the Company and held in treasury for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, this investment was accounted for as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. Upon the consummation of the Transactions, the fair value of the shares of $89.5 million was recorded as a reduction to shareholder's equity.\nChange in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares was $35.4 million. The Company remeasures at each reporting period the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares. From the consummation of the Transactions to December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants and the unvested founder shares decreased by $11.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the drop in the stock price of the Company's Class A common stock over that period.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nNet loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $546.9 million generated a benefit for income taxes of $26.3 million with an effective tax rate of 4.8%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, non-deductible mark-to-market liability, changes in the Company's deferred state tax rate due to operations, and state tax expense.\nNet (Loss) Income\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $520.6 million as compared to net income of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income of $530.3 million was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of $45.1 million, increases in costs of services of $169.1 million (of which $170.9 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation), increases in general and administrative expenses of $280.4 million (of which $250.0 million was due to increases in stock-based compensation and $28.4 million was due to increases in transaction costs), increases in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, and increases in amortization of intangible assets of $0.6 million, offset by decreases in interest expense of $40.7 million, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million, increases in the benefit for income taxes of $27.1 million and increases in interest income of $0.1 million as explained in the sections above.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nThe following table provides the results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n____________________\nN/M = Not meaningful\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $982.9 million as compared to revenues of $1,040.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $58.0 million, or 5.6%. This decrease in revenues was attributed to declines in Network Services revenues of $49.0 million and Analytics-Based Services revenues of $23.5 million, offset by growth in Payment Integrity Services revenues of $14.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Network Services revenues were $314.5 million as compared to $363.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $49.0 million, or 13.5%. This decrease was primarily due to declines in volumes of some customers as claims were moved from using our Network Services product to our Analytics-Based Services products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from our Analytics-Based Services, including Financial Negotiation and Reference-Based Pricing revenues, were $561.5 million as compared to $585.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $23.5 million, or 4.0%. Decreases in the Analytics-Based Services revenues were primarily due to an aggregate decline in Analytics-Based Services claims and revenues as a result of a change in claims practice by certain customers beginning in the third quarter of 2018. This change in claims practice resulted in an approximately $50 to $60 million decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year; however, claims and revenue from such customers began to stabilize by the end of 2019. We also experienced slower than expected growth in our Analytics-Based Services for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from implementation issues at certain customers due to the need to revise their internal policies and/or update their end-user plan documentation.\nCosts of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets)\nCosts of services for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $149.6 million, as compared to costs of services of $149.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. The increase in 2019 costs of services was primarily due to increases in other expenses of $1.0 million primarily due to increases in facilities expenses as a result of increases in office space rented and rent increases, offset by decreases in personnel expenses of $0.1 million and access and bill review fees of $0.7 million.\nPersonnel expenses, including contract labor, were $115.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $115.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.1%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $8.1 million, offset by increases in bonuses, commissions, and fringe benefits of $8.1 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nAccess and bill review fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $16.0 million, as compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.4%. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in network access fees for accessing non-owned third-party provider networks, primarily due to reduced volume and a renegotiated agreement with one of our large leased networks.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $75.2 million as compared to $77.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.0%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in stock-based compensation of $11.5 million, offset by increases in other personnel expenses of $9.2 million. Stock-based compensation expense declined as a result of changes in valuation of our Units year-over-year.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense was $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing an increase of $3.5 million. This increase was due to $63.6 million of purchases of property and equipment, including internally generated capitalized software in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $334.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. This expense represents the amortization of intangible assets, as explained above and in the notes to our financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Interest Income, and Gain on Repurchase and Cancellation of Notes\nInterest expense was $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $6.9 million, or 1.8%. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in interest on the Senior PIK Notes due to the repurchase and cancellation of the Senior PIK Notes as explained below and the combination of $100 million less term debt during most of 2019, as well as lower Term Loan G interest rates in the last half of 2019, offsetting higher interest rates that occurred in the first half of 2019, as compared to the comparable time periods in 2018. During third quarter 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. The write-off of debt issue costs and discount are included in interest expense. Interest income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to interest income of $51 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense attributable to the Senior PIK Notes, including the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts, were $113.0 million and $115.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt was $5,397.1 million and included (i) $2,710.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $6.2 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $10.3 million, (iii) $1,178.7 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $7.4 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $48.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt had an annualized weighted average interest rate of 6.3%. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize expense for the portions of debt issuance costs related to the amounts of the principal loan prepayments of Term Loan G made in each year, which resulted in an understatement of long-term debt of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We corrected this\nerror as an out-of-period adjustment resulting in an overstatement of interest expense of $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our long-term debt was $5,603.4 million and included (i) $2,810.0 million Term Loan G, discount on Term Loan G of $7.8 million, (ii) $1,560.0 million of 7.125% Notes, premium on 7.125% Notes of $12.3 million, (iii) $1,300.0 million of Senior PIK Notes, discount on Senior PIK Notes of $10.6 million, and (iv) $0.1 million of long-term finance lease obligations, net of (v) debt issue costs of $60.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $10.5 million generated a provision for income taxes of $0.8 million with an effective tax rate of 7.6%. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $44.3 million generated a provision for income taxes of $8.1 million with an effective tax rate of 18.3%. Our effective tax rate during the 2019 and 2018 periods differed from the statutory rate primarily due to stock-based compensation expense and state tax rates. In 2018, there was a $4.9 million one-time non-cash benefit due to a change in state tax rates.\nNet Income\nNet income for the year-ended December 31, 2019 was $9.7 million as compared to net income of $36.2 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net income of $26.5 million was primarily due to decreases in revenues of $58.0 million, increases in depreciation of $3.5 million, increase in costs of services of $0.1 million, offset by gain on the repurchase and cancellation of notes of $18.5 million, decreases in general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million, decreases in interest expense of $6.9 million, decreases in the provision for income taxes of $7.3 million, and increases in interest income of $0.1 million, as explained in the sections above. During 2019, we repurchased and cancelled $121.3 million of the Senior PIK Notes. The cash repurchase of $101.0 million plus accrued interest resulted in the recognition of a gain of $18.5 million, as well as a write-off of the pro-rata share of debt issue costs of $1.0 million and discount of $0.8 million. These amounts are included in interest expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $126.8 million and $450.0 million of loan availability under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the Refinancing, the commitments under the Revolver G were increased from $100.0 million to $450.0 million and $369.0 million of indebtedness under the Term Loan G were repaid. In March 2020, $98.0 million of borrowings were drawn on our Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21.8 million, three letters of credit totaling $1.8 million of utilization against the Revolver G and $98.2 million loan availability under Revolver G. The three letters of credit are used to satisfy real estate lease agreements for three of our offices in lieu of security deposits. We have the $1.8 million letters of credit as of December 31, 2020; however they are no longer utilized against the revolver.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds combined with our borrowing capacity under our Revolver G. We believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We may from time to time at our sole discretion, purchase, redeem or retire our long-term debt, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise. We plan to finance our capital expenditures with cash from operations. Furthermore, our future liquidity and future ability to fund capital expenditures, working capital and debt requirements are also dependent upon our future financial performance, which is subject to many economic, commercial, financial and other factors that are beyond our control, including the ability of financial institutions to meet their lending obligations to us. If those factors significantly change, our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to meet our liquidity needs. We anticipate that to the extent we require additional liquidity as a result of these factors or in order to execute our strategy, it would be financed either by borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, by other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of the foregoing. We may be unable to obtain any such additional financing on reasonable terms or at all.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from operating activities provided $377.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This $93.1 million, or 32.7%, increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of increases in net income after adjusting for non-cash items of $69.4 million and changes in net working capital of $23.7 million.\nThe increase of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $69.4 million was due to an increase of non-cash items of $599.7 million partially offset by an increase in net loss of $530.3 million.\nThe $599.7 million increase in non-cash items was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $420.9 million, increase in loss on extinguishment of debt of $121.4 million, change in the deferred tax benefit of $66.4 million, loss on investments of $12.2 million, and the increase in non-cash interest costs of $9.5 million including increases in debt issue costs, increases in depreciation expense of $4.8 million, increase in amortization of intangible assets $0.6 million, and loss on disposal of assets of $0.4 million, offset by the change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares of $35.4 million and decrease in the amortization of right-of-use-asset of $1.2 million.\nThe increase in net loss of $530.3 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, increases in costs of services, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, and loss on debt extinguishment, offset by reductions in interest expense, increases in change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants and unvested founder shares, increases in the benefit for income taxes, and increases in interest income as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, $30.0 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $14.8 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, decreases in prepaid taxes of $2.1 million primarily due to a retrospective change in the tax law, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.1 million primarily due to an increase in accrued interest of $13.6 million and accrued taxes of $9.8 million, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $7.5 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $8.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows from operating activities provided $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This $8.0 million reduction in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of reductions in net income of $26.5 million adjusted for changes in non-cash items of $35.0 million, offset by changes in net working capital of $53.6 million. The reduction in net income of $26.5 million was primarily the result of reductions in revenues, gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, and reductions in the provision for income taxes, as explained above. Changes in non-cash items are primarily due to changes in the gain on repurchase and cancellation of notes, as explained above, and stock-based compensation as a result of the semi-annual valuation as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as explained above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, $6.4 million was provided by changes in working capital including decreases in net accounts receivable of $5.3 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other of $20.8 million primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in accrued compensation, offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.8 million, prepaid taxes of $1.4 million and decreases in operating lease obligations of $9.5 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, $37.6 million was used by operating activities for changes to working capital, including decreases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of $40.4 million and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.7 million, offset by decreases in net accounts receivable of $3.0 million primarily due to declines in year-over-year revenues and timing of collections, and decreases in prepaid taxes of $4.4 million due to the impact of the TCJA in 2017 as explained below. Accounts payable and accrued expenses and other decreased $40.4 million primarily due to decreases in accrued interest of $3.8 million, accrued other liabilities of $8.4 million including administrative and network fees, and accrued compensation of $27.6 million resulting from reductions in employee bonuses, commissions, related fringe benefits and profit sharing in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash of $210.8 million was used in investing activities including $140.0 million for the acquisition of HST and $70.8 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development of $4.4 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash of $66.4 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash of $63.6 million was used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software development. This increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to increased capitalization of software development on capital projects primarily to enhance our information technology infrastructure and platforms to increase efficiencies, data security, and service line capabilities.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $61.6 million primarily consisting of $369.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G, $1,615.6 million for the extinguishment of the 7.125% Notes, $1,202.3 million for extinguishment of the Senior PIK Notes, $682.4 million for the effect of the Transactions, $101.1 million for the purchase of treasury stock, and $23.5 million for the payment of debt issuance costs, offset by $1,267.5 million of cash provided by the issuance of Senior Convertible PIK Notes and $1,300.0 million of cash provided by the issuance of the 5.750% Notes. In addition, there was $98.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $201.1 million primarily consisting of $100.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G and $101.0 million for the repurchase of Senior PIK Notes.\nCash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $245.2 million primarily consisting of $245.0 million of prepayments on our Term Loan G. In addition, there was $5.0 million of borrowings on and repayments of our Revolver G.\nTerm Loans and Revolvers\nOn June 7, 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of us by affiliates of H&F, we borrowed $3,500.0 million with a group of lenders due and payable on June 7, 2023, creating the Term Loan G and settled all other outstanding term loans. We had a $100.0 million revolving credit facility in conjunction with Term Loan G. On March 19, 2020, we drew $98.0 million on Revolver G. This borrowing was a precautionary measure taken due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there were no liquidity issues related to COVID-19, the Revolver G and associated interest were repaid on June 25, 2020.\nThe term loan and revolver are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible property, including a pledge of all of the capital stock of each of our subsidiaries.\nTerm Loan G was refinanced on June 12, 2017 to lower the applicable margin on the interest rate by 1.00 % with terms otherwise similar to the former term loan, including a 2023 maturity and the same security and guarantee package. The proceeds of the new term loan were used to repay our existing term loan. As a result of the Term Loan G refinancing on June 12, 2017, and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of $20.1 million recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt, including the write off of $4.9 million of the term loan discount and $15.2 million of debt issuance costs. During the first quarter of 2018, we achieved a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate margin of Term Loan G due to an improved leverage ratio, resulting in a lower interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. These amounts are included in the loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOn July 2, 2020 the Company, the administrative agent and the revolving credit lenders agreed to amend the revolving credit facility maturity date to June 7, 2023, or September 1, 2022 should the aggregate principal outstanding on the Senior PIK Notes exceed $300 million on September 1, 2022.\nFor all our debt agreements with an interest rate dependent on LIBOR, we are currently assessing and monitoring how transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may affect us past 2023.

the U.S. healthcare industry to help manage costs and optimize payments. \n\n- Revenues for 2020 were $937.8 million, down 4.6% compared to 2019 due to reduced volumes from COVID-19 restrictions. Net loss was $520.6 million compared to net income of $9.7 million in 2019, primarily due to non-cash expenses like stock compensation and loss on debt extinguishment. \n\n- In October 2020, MultiPlan completed a merger transaction and issued new debt, reducing interest expense by about $70 million annually. It also acquired healthcare technology company HST in November 2020.\n\n- Cash flows from operations were $377.4 million in 2020 compared to $284.3 million in 2019. Investing activities used $210.8 million, including for the HST acquisition, compared to $66.4 million in 2019. Financing activities used $61.6 million compared to $201.1 million in 2019.\n\n- At December 31, 2020, MultiPlan had $126.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $450 million available on its revolving credit facility. Its debt refinancing in 2020 extended maturity dates and lowered interest rates.\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted MultiPlan's 2020 results but the extent of future impact remains uncertain depending on factors like vaccine availability and effectiveness. The company believes it has sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months."}
