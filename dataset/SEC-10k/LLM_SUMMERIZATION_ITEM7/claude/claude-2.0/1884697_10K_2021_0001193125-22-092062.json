MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other factors set forth in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been reported previously in our final prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) (File No. 333-260847), filed with the SEC on February 15, 2022, under the heading \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Starry.\u201d\nOverview\nWe have developed a unique and innovative solution to provide last mile fixed broadband using a proprietary fixed wireless technology stack operating in licensed spectrum. We design and build our own fixed wireless equipment, cloud-based network control plane and billing and operations support systems to run our network and provide our service. We deploy this technology across a variety of markets to provide a robust and competitively-priced broadband service to customers. The integration of our own technology and service delivery allows us to efficiently deploy new competitive broadband networks to connect communities across the country.\nSince our inception, we have developed the technology, optimized the unit economics, acquired spectrum and deployed our network and acquired subscribers in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C., and Columbus.\nBusiness Combination and Public Company Costs\nOn October 6, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with FirstMark, Merger Sub and Starry. The Business Combination was consummated whereby: (a) on March 28, 2022, FirstMark merged with and into Starry Group, with Starry Group surviving the SPAC Merger as a publicly traded entity and became the sole owner of Merger Sub, and (b) on March 29, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Starry, with Starry surviving the Acquisition Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Starry Group.\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Under this method of accounting, FirstMark is treated as the acquired company and Starry is treated as the accounting acquirer and the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of Starry issuing stock for the net assets of FirstMark, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of FirstMark are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects and the financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects.\nThe most significant change in our future reported financial position and results are expected to be an estimated increase in cash (as compared to our balance sheet at December 31, 2021) of approximately $155.7 million, including $109.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the PIPE Shares and $31.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the Series Z Shares consummated substantially simultaneously with the Business Combination. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nAs a consequence of the Business Combination, we became an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company, which has required and will continue to require us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees.\nAdditionally, we expect both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> continue to invest in our technology to improve capacity and reduce cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> deploy our network technology and capital equipment in additional domestic markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> sign up new subscribers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> hire additional personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> obtain, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property and FCC spectrum license portfolio; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> operate as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNetwork Deployment\nWe have deployed our fixed wireless network in six markets to date, covering approximately 5.3 million households by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. The number of markets that we anticipate launching per year is variable and depends on our capital allocation strategy; the competitive environment for internet services nationally, regionally, and locally at a point in time; government obligations, including our obligations under RDOF and any additional subsidy programs in which we might participate; new partnerships and other factors. We anticipate launching our network in one to six or more markets per year over the near to medium term.\nThe deployment of fixed wireless networks involves installing our base stations on tall vertical assets, which are connected to the internet through backhaul connections to the base stations, routed through a point-of-presence in the market. These networks serve the end customer locations, at which we install a transceiver to receive the signal, and a Wi-Fi router in the premises to deliver the service. We then use these networks to provide service to our customers for a fee. The speed and scale of these deployments impact the universe of customers that we can serve, and therefore our revenues.\nIn order to effectively manage supply chain to help meet product demand, we had $3.8 million in prepaid inventory as of December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Demand\nWe sell a stand-alone broadband product for a flat monthly fee. Broadband demand continues to grow, and broadband plays an essential role in society - it is used for education, work, healthcare, and entertainment. Consumer demand for broadband is incredibly robust, and we expect it to continue to grow into the future. However, to the extent consumer sentiment towards broadband services changes, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nCustomer Acquisition\nWe acquire customers through three primary sales strategies. First, for larger apartment and condominium buildings, we enter into simple access agreements with the building owners or associations, as applicable, giving us permission to install our transceiver and use the buildings' wiring to provide the service to their residents. Then, we sell the service directly to the residents. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person events, email, and traditional mail. Second, for small apartment and condominium buildings and single-family homes we sell the service directly to the consumer through digital marketing channels, email, traditional mail, and outdoor media. We then obtain permission from the resident to install our transceiver at the building or single-family home as part of the account creation process. Third, for apartment and condominium\nbuildings of various sizes, we enter into bulk billing agreements where the building owner, association, or other third party (e.g., a management company or short-term rental company) purchases the service for a specified number of units at the building and pays us directly for such services. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person meetings and email. To the extent that these efforts are unsuccessful, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nSeasonality and Housing Trends\nOur customers today are all residential subscribers, and the majority of our customers in the future will continue to be residential subscribers. There are some seasonal trends that affect our customer acquisition activities, and they can vary by market. Examples include markets with larger college and university student populations, which tend to move in and move out of residences within the same time frame. In addition, consumers naturally consider their broadband provider at the time at which they move to a new residence. To the extent that the velocity of moving changes over time, it would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nIncumbent Competition\nWe compete with several large incumbent fixed wireline providers, which can vary by market. In some instances, we also compete with mobile providers to the extent that an individual consumer considers a mobile service a substitute for a fixed service. We have built our business to allow us to compete effectively with very low penetration rates in any market, and by offering very competitive pricing. In any market, an incumbent provider may engage in promotional activities or price competition, which would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe conduct business through one operating segment. See \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Components of Statements of Operations\nRevenues\nWe deliver high speed and competitively priced broadband service and related support on a subscription basis to our customers in the Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C. and Columbus markets using innovative and proprietary wireless technology. Our subscription rate for such services is a per-month fixed price, without data caps or additional fees. Most of our customers are month-to-month individual subscribers who do not have long-term commitments contracts with us, but a small number are building owners or property management companies who have a commercial arrangement with us whereby such customers compensate us directly for providing our internet services in their buildings.\nWe expect our revenues to continue to increase as we acquire new subscribers in existing markets and new markets we plan to enter, and as we introduce new products and services.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues includes, but is not limited to, costs incurred supporting national network service costs, fiber backhaul costs, site rent and utilities, customer care and national operations personnel, freight charges, deployed equipment costs, associated depreciation and vehicle-related expenses among other costs.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow in our existing markets as well as expand into new markets. Historically, approximately 15% of our cost of revenues have been variable costs whereas approximately 85% have been fixed costs. Variable costs include direct costs related to subscriber growth as well as customer care, revenue share payments to building owners and credit card fees. The significant amount of equipment required to be deployed before we add subscribers results in substantial amounts of cost related to depreciation expense. We consider depreciation expense to be a fixed cost. These fixed costs have a significant impact on the minimum amount of revenues required to achieve gross profit, which would have been $79.8 million and $60.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs that include salaries and wages, commissions, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and certain employee expenses along with software and equipment expenses, recruiting expenses, professional fees, depreciation expenses, facilities related expenses, marketing expenses, and other fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount to keep pace with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, that includes the incremental costs associated with SEC compliance, legal, audit, insurance and investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development activities help to increase our network capacity over time and further improve our unit economics by reducing the cost of network elements.\nResearch and development expenses include, but are not limited to, costs incurred in performing engineering and prototype manufacturing activities relating to our products and services, including salaries, benefits, facilities, rent, software, depreciation, research-related overhead expenses, contracted services, license fees, and other external costs. Such expenses are critical to supporting our innovative low-cost hardware and cloud-based software solutions, including increasing capacity and decreasing cost over time.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in new technologies to achieve our operational and commercial goals of expanding our capacity and lowering costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest (both cash and non-cash) incurred on our debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of the fair value adjustments related to our derivative liability and the loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our interest-bearing accounts.\nResults of Operations\nComparison for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations on a consolidated basis for the years ended

31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of an increase in our customer relationships primarily driven by further network expansion in the markets we serve (i.e., an increase in homes serviceable) and increased penetration.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased by $19.8 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases of $9.7 million in deployed equipment depreciation related to our network expansion, $1.6 million in rental payments related to our base stations and revenue share payments to our building owners, $2.8 million related to headcount growth in customer service and national network operations, $2.4 million in fiber costs, $1.1 million in inventory reserves and write-offs and $0.6 million of incremental expenses related to additional fleet vehicles needed to expand our service capabilities in the markets we serve.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.9 million, or 21.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $5.9 million in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million in marketing costs, $0.9 million in software subscriptions, $0.7 million in outside consulting professional fees, $0.4 million in employee travel costs, $0.4 million in rent expense, $0.3 million in business insurance and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $1.7 million in salaries and benefits, $0.6 million in engineering related costs and $0.4 million in consulting services.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $5.4 million, or 27.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in paid-in-kind interest expense of $2.7 million incurred on the Starry Credit Agreement (as defined below) and amortization of debt discounts of $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the issuance of $31.2 million of the 2020 Notes (as defined below) in September 2020 and the detachable warrants issued with the Starry Credit Agreement. Such increase also included the amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million.\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net increased by $10.5 million, or 577.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of the derivative liability recorded for the accelerated repayment feature on the Term Loans (as defined below). See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet loss\nNet loss attributable to our shareholders increased by $41.5 million, or 33.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the factors described above.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Addressable Households\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,691,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,691,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Homes Serviceable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,307,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,162,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Relationships\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Penetration of Homes Serviceable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,826 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per User (\u201cARPU\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(166,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(125,093 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,745 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(83,590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Addressable Households\nAddressable Households are the estimated total number of households within our service territory that we could serve in the markets where we intend to deploy or have deployed a network, assuming the network was fully built and we could serve every household. We calculate the Addressable Households by counting the total households within our spectrum license areas meeting a specified threshold of household density. Addressable Households grows as we begin to execute plans to expand our network in new markets or in new parts of existing markets, and will follow a growth trend as we expand the network. Growth in Addressable Households precedes growth in Homes Serviceable.\nAddressable Households remained unchanged from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 because we did not add new markets during such period and continued to expand within the existing markets we serve by deploying incremental network assets.\nHomes Serviceable\nHomes Serviceable are the estimated households that we could serve using the network that we have deployed in our markets at a given date. This is a subset of the Addressable Households and reflects the size of the network we have deployed as well as the households that we can technologically and commercially serve. Homes Serviceable is a count of all of the households that fall within the coverage area of our deployed network, and will grow as we continue to deploy our network in existing markets and as we deploy in new markets as we expand our Addressable Households.\nHomes Serviceable increased by 1.1 million, or 27.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to the deployment of incremental network assets within the markets that we serve.\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer Relationships include customers who have signed up for a service and all units that are billed under our bulk billing arrangements where a building owner, association, or other third-party is invoiced for a specific number of units within multiple dwelling unit buildings. Customer Relationships include Starry internet service, currently our only service, and will include unique relationships for small and medium size business service, voice service, and potentially other services in the future.\nCustomer Relationships increased by 28.7 thousand, or 83.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to new customers signing up for our services and additional bulk billing arrangements for such services sold to third parties who manage or own multifamily dwelling unit buildings.\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable is the ratio of the total number of Customer Relationships to the total number of Homes Serviceable and represents the percentage of households that can receive service with which we have developed a Customer Relationship. Penetration of Homes Serviceable grows as markets mature, but may fluctuate depending on the pace of our network expansion if growth in the denominator (Homes Serviceable) significantly outpaces the numerator (Customer Relationships).\nAverage revenue per user (\u201cARPU\u201d)\nWe use ARPU to evaluate and monitor the amount of revenue generated by customers and analyze growth patterns. ARPU values represent total revenue divided by the average number of customer relationships at the beginning and end of each period, divided by the number of months in the period.\nWe believe ARPU is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. ARPU and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of ARPU may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nARPU decreased by $1.71, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the use of customer promotional plans to increase penetration in the markets that we serve.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is determined based on EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), adjusted to exclude certain unusual or non-recurring items, certain non-cash items and other items that are not indicative of ongoing operations (including stock-based compensation expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities). Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by management, research analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies. We believe that this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure not defined under GAAP. It has limitations, because it excludes certain types of expenses and it does not reflect changes in working capital needs. Furthermore, other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly entitled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented here as a supplemental measure only. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment.\nFor a historical reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, please refer to the table below.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Net Loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(166,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(125,093 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(112,344 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,400 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Fair value adjustment of derivative liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Share-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,745 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(83,590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe are an early-stage growth company and have generated losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. Our principal sources of liquidity have been generated through a combination of cash flows from borrowings and the issuances equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be used to execute on our strategic initiatives through (i) investing in our technology, (ii) expanding our domestic footprint and (iii) hiring personnel. We require additional capital investment to execute the strategic business plan to grow its subscriber base in existing markets from already-deployed network assets and launch services in new markets. Management plans to raise additional capital through a combination of potential options, including but not limited to, equity and debt financings.\nAdditional equity financing may not be available on favorable terms and could be dilutive to current stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments.\nOur ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our expansion efforts and other operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of this uncertainty, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued.\nAt December 31, 2021 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million and consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts, of which $15.0 million cannot be accessed in accordance with the Starry Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2022, the Business Combination was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $36.2 million. Following the SPAC Merger Effective Time and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Date, (a) the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $109.0 million, and (b) the sale of the Series Z Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $31.0 million. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nStarry Credit Agreement\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement among Starry, Starry Spectrum Holdings LLC, Starry (MA), Inc., Starry Spectrum LLC, Testco LLC, Widmo Holdings LLC and Vibrant Composites Inc., as borrowers, the lenders party thereto from time to time and ArrowMark Agency Services, LLC, as administrative agent, as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the \u201cStarry Credit Agreement\u201d) to provide a total of $50.0 million in two separate loan tranches, $27.5 million and $22.5 million, and drew on the full amount of each tranche in February 2019 and June 2019, respectively. In December 2019, we amended the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional loan tranche of $75.0 million, which we immediately drew upon in full (collectively, the \u201c2019 Term Loans\u201d).\nIn June 2021, we entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver to the Starry Credit Agreement (the \u201cThird Amendment and Waiver\u201d). The Third Amendment and Waiver amended and restated two affirmative covenants that we were not in compliance with as of December 31, 2020, including extending the time period in which we are required to deliver audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis and extending the time period in which we are required to deliver a budget for fiscal year 2021. The non-compliance with covenants is an event of default which would have required the outstanding long-term debt balance to be payable upon demand. In addition to the amendment and restatement, the Third Amendment and Waiver waived any events of default in existence on the Third Amendment and Waiver effective date. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nIn conjunction with entering into the 2019 Term Loans, we issued warrants to the lender in two tranches in February 2019 and December 2019 of 17.6 million and 15.0 million, respectively.\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional tranche of $40.0 million which we immediately drew upon in full (\u201cTranche C Term Loan\u201d) and up to an additional $10.0 million in delayed draw loans (\u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Loan\u201d) (collectively, with the Tranche C Term Loan and 2019 Term Loans, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d).\nIn conjunction with entering into the Tranche C Term Loan, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement as of October 6, 2021 (the \u201cWarrant Purchase Agreement\u201d), and issued to the lenders warrants to purchase 11.5 million shares (the \u201cInitial Tranche C Warrants\u201d). Warrants to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares are contingently issuable subject to our drawing down on the Delayed Draw Tranche C Loan (the \u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Initial Tranche C Warrants, the \u201cTranche C Warrants\u201d). Upon issuance of such warrants, 25% immediately vested and became exercisable. As the Business Combination closed prior to April 15, 2022, the Tranche C Warrants are exercisable solely with respect to the 25% of the warrant shares that vested immediately upon issuance, whereas the remaining 75% of unvested warrants were forfeited. We determined the fair value per share of our underlying Common Stock of the Warrant Purchase Agreement to be $1.81 per the terms of the Business Combination.\nThe loans incur interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), subject to a floor of 2.0% plus an applicable margin of 9.0%, capped at 13.25% annually. Pursuant to the Starry Credit Agreement, we elected to pay the accrued interest on an in-kind basis by increasing the principal balance outstanding, payable in its entirety at maturity in February 2024. Outstanding borrowings plus accrued paid-in-kind interest were $202.7 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had deferred financing costs and discounts on warrants on these loans in the amount of $2.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively.\nOn March 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement amended and restated an affirmative covenant requiring the Company to provide annual audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis. In addition, the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement redefined the term \u201cChange in Control\u201d to exclude the aforementioned Business Combination with respect to contemplating the prepayment penalty. As a result of such amendments, the Company was in compliance with all bank covenants as of December 31, 2021. Without such amendments the Company would have been in default and the outstanding long-term debt balance would be payable upon demand. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nCapital lease obligations\nThroughout the period we entered into capital leases for vehicles and equipment with various vendors with payments due monthly extending through 2025. As of December 31, 2021, we owed $2.2 million under such lease obligations.\nStrategic partner arrangement\nIn June 2020, we entered into a 10-year arrangement (the \u201cStrategic Partner Arrangement\u201d) with AEPV to jointly deploy a fixed wireless broadband network in a new market. AEPV has agreed to fund the equipment necessary to deliver the service in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement whereby they will be entitled to a percentage of revenue earned by us in the new market. Pursuant to the arrangement, we will sell in exchange for\ncash consideration the equipment to AEPV and lease the equipment back. The seller-financing portion of the transaction created a form of continuing involvement which precludes sale-leaseback accounting until the related amounts due are paid in full. Accordingly, we accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction with AEPV, with the equipment remaining on our books at its then carrying value, the net cash proceeds received being reflected as a financing obligation, and the expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement to the third party being treated as debt service applied to interest and principal over the initial 10-year term. The discount rate is calculated based on expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement. AEPV has the right to terminate the arrangement for any reason no earlier than June 2023. In the event of an early termination, we are required to repurchase the equipment at a repurchase price equal to the net book value of the equipment as reflected on the third party's balance sheet at the time of termination. We have made an accounting policy election to use the prospective method to account for changes in actual or estimated cash flows related to the debt service. See \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and contingencies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase commitments\nThroughout the period we entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various contract manufacturers to purchase materials and associated support to maintain and improve our existing distribution system as well as build out new networks and distribution systems. As of December 31, 2021, we had non-cancelable commitments totaling $33.4 million.\nConvertible notes payable\nIn September 2020, we issued convertible notes (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $31.2 million. The 2020 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and matured in June 2021. In 2021 and 2020, such notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such proceeds were used for building out the network and general working capital purposes.\nOne current shareholder who is a related party purchased approximately $2.3 million of the 2020 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn January 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cJanuary 2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $6.0 million. The January 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the January 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nIn March 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cMarch 2021 Notes\u201d and, together with the January 2021 Notes, the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $5.0 million. The March 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the March 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nTwo current shareholders who are related parties purchased $3.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively of the 2021 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn March 2021, we closed on an issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), generating cash proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $119.9 million and converted all $42.8 million of our outstanding 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes into shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nShort term liquidity requirements\nAs a growth company, the net losses we have incurred since inception are in accordance with our strategy and forecast. We will continue to incur net losses in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to expand our platform development to improve our existing technology and expand into new markets.\nWe incurred a net loss of $166.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net loss of $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our current assets were $43.9 million, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million, which are primarily deposited with financial institutions, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.1 million and deferred costs of $7.0 million, and our current liabilities were $33.1 million, consisting of accounts payable totaling $6.8 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities totaling $23.2 million, unearned revenue totaling $1.6 million, and the current portion of our debt totaling $1.5 million.\nLong term liquidity requirements\nAs a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, the sale of the PIPE Shares and the sale of the Series Z Shares, we successfully raised gross proceeds of $36.2 million, $109.0 million and $31.0 million, respectively. However, our existing capital resources may be insufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements. We may be required to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through either further equity or debt financing. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. The terms of additional debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,583 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(78,945 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68,903 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,906 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(51,535 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash used in operating activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in operating activities was $98.6 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $166.5 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $70.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts of $2.3 million. The adjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $29.5 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans, the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes and the Strategic Partner Arrangement of $18.2 million, (iii) amortization of debt discounts and deferred charges of $5.4 million, (iv) conversion of the convertible debt discount of $1.0 million, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.7 million, (vi) fair value adjustment of the derivative liability of $8.6 million, (vii) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $2.2 million, (viii) $1.3 million in share-based compensation expense, (ix) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.2 million and (x) provision for doubtful accounts of less than $0.2 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $3.5 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (ii) $0.8 million in other liabilities, and (iii) $0.5 million in unearned revenue, offset by decreases of (i) $5.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, (ii) $1.2 million in accounts payable, (iii) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (iv) $0.2 million in other assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in operating activities was $78.9 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $125.1 million, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of $43.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts and certain non-cash expenses of $3.0 million. The\nadjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $19.4 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans and the 2020 Notes of $15.4 million, (iii) amortization of debt discount of $3.8 million, (iv) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.5 million, (v) fair value adjustment to a derivative liability of $1.9 million, (vi) $1.0 million in share-based compensation expense, (vii) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.1 million and (viii) provision for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $1.2 million in other liabilities, (ii) $0.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (iii) $0.7 million in accounts payable, (iv) $0.8 million in unearned revenue, (v) and $0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by decreases of (i) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (ii) less than $0.1 million in other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $68.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $171.4 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), net of issuance costs, of $119.9 million, proceeds from Term Loans, net of issuance costs, of $38.5 million, proceeds from the issuance of $11.0 million of the 2021 Notes, proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $3.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of Starry Options (as defined below) of $0.8 million, offset by repayments of capital lease obligations of $0.8 million, payments of deferred transaction costs of $1.0 million and payments of third-party issuance costs of $0.3 million in connection with the Term Loans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $63.3 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the (i) issuance of Starry Series D Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, of $30.7 million, (ii) issuance of convertible notes of $31.2 million, (iii) proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $1.7 million and (iv) exercise of Starry Options of $0.2 million, partially offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations of $0.6 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies require a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimating fair value of Starry's Common Stock for Share-Based Compensation\nAs a company with no active public market for its common stock prior to the Business Combination, Starry's board of directors periodically determines the fair value of Starry's common stock at various dates, with the assistance of management and an independent third-party valuation specialist. In connection with establishing the exercise price for all share-based awards and estimating the fair value of Starry's common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we obtained third-party valuations by an independent valuation firm. The valuations dated as of May 15, 2021, March 30, 2021, March 31, 2020 and March 6, 2019, were conducted in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation utilizing the income approach for the May 15, 2021 and March 31, 2020 valuation and the market approach for the March 30, 2021 and March 6, 2019 valuations. The market approach was chosen as the primary valuation process for the March 2021 and March 2019 valuations due to our entering into transactions relating to our stock around the dates of valuation. The income approach was chosen for the May 2021 and March 2020 valuations because no recent stock transactions had taken place around the valuation dates and the approach takes into consideration the expectation of future cash flows that drives value to our shareholders.\nAn income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow analysis incorporating our projections, our historical financials, and guideline company / industry growth and margin indications, was utilized. The income approach estimates our value based on the expectation of future cash flows that we will generate that are discounted to the present using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with us and our projections. The selected discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital as well as consideration given to historical venture capital rates commensurate with an expansion-stage to bridge-stage company. A discounted cash flow analysis was developed based on discussions with management, projected financial data prepared by us, historical financial statements, and guideline company and industry growth indicators.\nThe market approach measures the value of an asset or business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments or assets. When applied to the valuation of equity interests, consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the entity being appraised relative to those publicly traded in similar lines of business. The valuation specialist applied the backsolve method to derive our implied equity value from a transaction involving our own securities. In deriving this value, specific consideration is given to the rights and preferences of each class of equity and solving for the total equity value implied by the recent transaction in our securities.\nFor all valuations, the implied equity value was then allocated between classes of the Starry Series A Preferred Stock, Starry Series B Preferred Stock, Starry Series C Preferred Stock, Starry Series D Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock, Starry Series Seed Preferred Stock and Starry Series Z Preferred Stock (collectively, the \u201cStarry Preferred Stock\u201d) and Starry's common stock using an Option Pricing Model (\u201cOPM\u201d), whereby the Starry Preferred Stock and Starry's common stock were treated as call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the stock class. The total value for each class of equity was then divided by the respective shares outstanding for that class to determine the per share value. A discount for lack of marketability was then applied to account for the lack of liquidity and marketability of the stock. The resulting value per share was the indicated present value, on a non-marketable and minority basis.\nFor the valuations used to establish the fair value of Starry's common stock, the following assumptions were used:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 15,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 30,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 6,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility - DLOM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Probability weighted time to exit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lack of marketability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of common stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is inherent uncertainty in our forecasts and projections, and if we had made different assumptions and estimates than those described previously, the amount of our beneficial conversion feature, share-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share amounts could have been materially different.\nSubsequent to the close of the Business Combination on March 29, 2022, the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant of a share-based award will be based on the market value at the time of each grant.\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated by sales of our internet services. The timing of such revenue recognition is based on the period that such services are consumed by the customer. The transaction price associated with our contracts often includes variable consideration. This variable consideration we consider to be constrained and is included only to the extent we believe it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nOur contracts with customers also may include service level agreements that entitle the customer to receive service credits and refunds if it is deemed that minimum service levels are not met. We estimate the amount of such credits and refunds based on our assessment of legal enforceability, anticipated performance, and historical trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant incidents of not meeting service level requirements.\nWe have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not recognize a significant financing component on contracts that are less than one year. We also exclude sales taxes and other government-assessed and imposed taxes from its revenue, when applicable.\nWe use marketing incentives to solicit potential subscriber interest in our services, including the issuance of gift cards. Such promotional gift cards represent consideration paid to potential customers in anticipation of a contract and are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nIncome taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recorded no income tax provision and have recorded a full valuation allowance for all periods. The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax attributes including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and R&D tax credit carryforwards.\nOur policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts have been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-based compensation\nWe account for share-based payments that involve the issuance of shares of Starry's common stock to employees and nonemployees and meet the criteria for equity-classified awards as share-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We issue awards of stock options to purchase shares of Starry common stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any warrants to purchase shares of Starry common stock, the \u201cStarry Options\u201d) to employees, members of the Starry board of directors, and non-employees under the Starry's Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Option and Grant Plan, as amended (\u201cStarry Stock Plan\u201d). We believe the fair value of share-based awards granted to nonemployees is more readily determinable than the fair value of the services received.\nWe estimate the fair value of Starry Options granted at each grant date using the Black Scholes model which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the length of time grantees will retain their vested Starry Options before exercising them for employees and the contractual term of the option for nonemployees (\u201cexpected term\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the expected dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the fair value of Starry's common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of Starry Options during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8% - 28.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0% - 28.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 - 6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 - 6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8% - 1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% - 1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Expected volatility - The expected volatility was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers, as we did not have any trading history for Starry's common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Expected term - For employees, the expected term is determined using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, as prescribed by the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to estimate on a formula basis the expected term of the Starry Options which are considered to have \u201cplain vanilla\u201d characteristics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate was based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury instruments with terms that were consistent with the expected term of Starry Options and,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield was based on our history and management's current expectation regarding future dividends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, share-based compensation cost on future award grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants. Higher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant. Future share-based compensation cost will increase to the extent that we grant additional share-based awards to employees and non-employees. If there are any modifications or cancelations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur incremental cost. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses and our research and development expenses.\nBased on our estimated fair value of Starry's common stock of $1.81 as of December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of the vested and unvested Starry Options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was $58.5 million.\nBeneficial conversion features associated with convertible notes\nWe issued convertible notes in September 2020, January 2021, and March 2021. Upon assessment of the embedded elements in these agreements, we identified that the automatic conversion feature upon maturity clauses contain a beneficial conversion feature that required separate accounting from the host contract.\nIn order to quantify the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature, we compared the current fair value of the Starry Series D Preferred Stock to the contractual conversion price using the fair value of Starry's common stock as of March 2021 and 2020. We used the input of the estimated fair value of Starry's common stock as the midpoint between the valuations at each date during the period to arrive at the intrinsic value. The beneficial conversion features related to the 2020 Notes, the January 2021 Notes and the March 2021 Notes were $3.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of $1.8 million and $0.2 million in paid-in-kind interest for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, we completed the initial closing of a new equity financing for Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock). As a result of the closing, the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes converted to shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively. We concluded the conversion of the 2020 Notes was treated as an accounting conversion in accordance with the original terms of the 2020 Notes and as a result carrying value of the 2020 Notes was reclassified to Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock. The conversion of the 2021 Notes was treated as an extinguishment of the 2021 Notes which included marking the Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock to fair value by way of recording a charge to the capital account of $2.8 million representing the additional value provided to the holders of the 2021 Notes upon settlement. We recorded a loss of $2.4 million upon extinguishment of the 2021 Notes.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of spectrum licenses acquired through FCC Auction 102 in June 2019 (the \u201cFCC licenses\u201d). The FCC licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless services. While the FCC licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, ten years for our licenses, the licenses are issued with a regulatory expectation of renewal which are routinely granted and with nominal cost.\nAt acquisition and each assessment period, we consider whether the FCC licenses should be definite or indefinite lived. The FCC licenses are not limited in their useful lives, nor is there an anticipation of another technology to replace the underlying technology. We believe that based on these factors that the FCC licenses are indefinite lived intangibles.\nThe FCC licenses are tested for potential impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), provides the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. ASC 350 permits us to elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. As of October 1, 2021, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment due to the passage of time and used a market-based approach that did not result in impairment. As of October 1, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment that did not identify any indicators of impairment that would require a quantitative assessment to be performed.\nCapitalization of internal labor costs\nOur business is capital intensive and a large portion of our working capital is spent on activities associated with expanding our distribution system. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying amount of our distribution systems was $92.0 million and $67.3 million, respectively, representing approximately 42% and 41%, respectively, of our total assets.\nCosts associated with distribution system construction and customer installations are capitalized as part of the asset cost. Such capitalized costs include materials, use tax, freight-in, third party labor, internal labor and the associated fringe benefits incurred to bring the distribution system to its intended use. We capitalize such internal labor costs by estimating the amount of time spent on such activities by employees who are responsible for our distribution system construction and customer installations. We capitalized internal labor costs of $17.8 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our activities could affect management's judgment about how we calculate and capitalize internal labor in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and perform updates to such policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances, such as the development of new products and services which may impact the utilization of our employees who construct our distribution system and perform customer installations.\nAsset retirement obligation (\u201cARO\u201d)\nWe lease space on vertical assets (\u201cVA\u201d) on which we install our Starry Titan base stations, and we enter into agreements with multiple dwelling unit (\u201cMDU\u201d) managers or owners to install our Starry Trident transceivers to provide service to the building. These agreements can include language regarding our responsibility to remove equipment and repair the asset to which the Starry equipment was attached (either a VA or a MDU) upon termination of the agreement. The agreements create an obligation associated with the future retirement of the equipment after normal operation of the equipment for the duration of the equipment's life.\nAsset retirement obligations are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be established. Once the fair value of future cash flows has been discounted to present value, the liability is recorded with an offsetting increase to an ARO long-lived asset that is recorded within property and equipment. Subsequent changes to the assets and liabilities are recognized in the period they occur.\nAs the estimated life of the ARO lapses, we recognize depreciation expense for the ARO asset and accretion expense for the ARO liability.\nIf factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, ARO on future MDU and VA equipment installations may differ significantly from ARO on past MDU and VA equipment installations. Higher credit adjusted risk free rates and inflation rates result in an increase to ARO determined at the date of installation. The assumptions and inputs from management, based on information known to us as of each reporting period include:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the rate of inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the adjusted risk-free rate\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the life of the lease\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> anticipated costs to of removal\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> anticipated costs of restoration\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn future periods, we expect amortization of our long-lived assets associated with the ARO as well as accretion of the ARO to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized amortization and accretion expense, as well as to the AROs associated with future equipment deployments.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSee \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements issued, not yet adopted\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and our assessment, to the extent we made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act allows emerging growth companies to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under Section 107, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Any decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We have elected to use the extended transition period available under the JOBS Act.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other factors set forth in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been reported previously in our final prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) (File No. 333-260847), filed with the SEC on February 15, 2022, under the heading \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Starry.\u201d\nOverview\nWe have developed a unique and innovative solution to provide last mile fixed broadband using a proprietary fixed wireless technology stack operating in licensed spectrum. We design and build our own fixed wireless equipment, cloud-based network control plane and billing and operations support systems to run our network and provide our service. We deploy this technology across a variety of markets to provide a robust and competitively-priced broadband service to customers. The integration of our own technology and service delivery allows us to efficiently deploy new competitive broadband networks to connect communities across the country.\nSince our inception, we have developed the technology, optimized the unit economics, acquired spectrum and deployed our network and acquired subscribers in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C., and Columbus.\nBusiness Combination and Public Company Costs\nOn October 6, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with FirstMark, Merger Sub and Starry. The Business Combination was consummated whereby: (a) on March 28, 2022, FirstMark merged with and into Starry Group, with Starry Group surviving the SPAC Merger as a publicly traded entity and became the sole owner of Merger Sub, and (b) on March 29, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Starry, with Starry surviving the Acquisition Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Starry Group.\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Under this method of accounting, FirstMark is treated as the acquired company and Starry is treated as the accounting acquirer and the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of Starry issuing stock for the net assets of FirstMark, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of FirstMark are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects and the financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects.\nThe most significant change in our future reported financial position and results are expected to be an estimated increase in cash (as compared to our balance sheet at December 31, 2021) of approximately $155.7 million, including $109.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the PIPE Shares and $31.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the Series Z Shares consummated substantially simultaneously with the Business Combination. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nAs a consequence of the Business Combination, we became an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company, which has required and will continue to require us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees.\nAdditionally, we expect both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u2022 continue to invest in our technology to improve capacity and reduce cost; \n \u2022 deploy our network technology and capital equipment in additional domestic markets; \n \u2022 sign up new subscribers; \n \u2022 hire additional personnel; \n \u2022 obtain, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property and FCC spectrum license portfolio; and \n \u2022 operate as a public company. \nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNetwork Deployment\nWe have deployed our fixed wireless network in six markets to date, covering approximately 5.3 million households by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. The number of markets that we anticipate launching per year is variable and depends on our capital allocation strategy; the competitive environment for internet services nationally, regionally, and locally at a point in time; government obligations, including our obligations under RDOF and any additional subsidy programs in which we might participate; new partnerships and other factors. We anticipate launching our network in one to six or more markets per year over the near to medium term.\nThe deployment of fixed wireless networks involves installing our base stations on tall vertical assets, which are connected to the internet through backhaul connections to the base stations, routed through a point-of-presence in the market. These networks serve the end customer locations, at which we install a transceiver to receive the signal, and a Wi-Fi router in the premises to deliver the service. We then use these networks to provide service to our customers for a fee. The speed and scale of these deployments impact the universe of customers that we can serve, and therefore our revenues.\nIn order to effectively manage supply chain to help meet product demand, we had $3.8 million in prepaid inventory as of December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Demand\nWe sell a stand-alone broadband product for a flat monthly fee. Broadband demand continues to grow, and broadband plays an essential role in society - it is used for education, work, healthcare, and entertainment. Consumer demand for broadband is incredibly robust, and we expect it to continue to grow into the future. However, to the extent consumer sentiment towards broadband services changes, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nCustomer Acquisition\nWe acquire customers through three primary sales strategies. First, for larger apartment and condominium buildings, we enter into simple access agreements with the building owners or associations, as applicable, giving us permission to install our transceiver and use the buildings' wiring to provide the service to their residents. Then, we sell the service directly to the residents. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person events, email, and traditional mail. Second, for small apartment and condominium buildings and single-family homes we sell the service directly to the consumer through digital marketing channels, email, traditional mail, and outdoor media. We then obtain permission from the resident to install our transceiver at the building or single-family home as part of the account creation process. Third, for apartment and condominium\nbuildings of various sizes, we enter into bulk billing agreements where the building owner, association, or other third party (e.g., a management company or short-term rental company) purchases the service for a specified number of units at the building and pays us directly for such services. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person meetings and email. To the extent that these efforts are unsuccessful, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nSeasonality and Housing Trends\nOur customers today are all residential subscribers, and the majority of our customers in the future will continue to be residential subscribers. There are some seasonal trends that affect our customer acquisition activities, and they can vary by market. Examples include markets with larger college and university student populations, which tend to move in and move out of residences within the same time frame. In addition, consumers naturally consider their broadband provider at the time at which they move to a new residence. To the extent that the velocity of moving changes over time, it would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nIncumbent Competition\nWe compete with several large incumbent fixed wireline providers, which can vary by market. In some instances, we also compete with mobile providers to the extent that an individual consumer considers a mobile service a substitute for a fixed service. We have built our business to allow us to compete effectively with very low penetration rates in any market, and by offering very competitive pricing. In any market, an incumbent provider may engage in promotional activities or price competition, which would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe conduct business through one operating segment. See \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Components of Statements of Operations\nRevenues\nWe deliver high speed and competitively priced broadband service and related support on a subscription basis to our customers in the Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C. and Columbus markets using innovative and proprietary wireless technology. Our subscription rate for such services is a per-month fixed price, without data caps or additional fees. Most of our customers are month-to-month individual subscribers who do not have long-term commitments contracts with us, but a small number are building owners or property management companies who have a commercial arrangement with us whereby such customers compensate us directly for providing our internet services in their buildings.\nWe expect our revenues to continue to increase as we acquire new subscribers in existing markets and new markets we plan to enter, and as we introduce new products and services.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues includes, but is not limited to, costs incurred supporting national network service costs, fiber backhaul costs, site rent and utilities, customer care and national operations personnel, freight charges, deployed equipment costs, associated depreciation and vehicle-related expenses among other costs.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow in our existing markets as well as expand into new markets. Historically, approximately 15% of our cost of revenues have been variable costs whereas approximately 85% have been fixed costs. Variable costs include direct costs related to subscriber growth as well as customer care, revenue share payments to building owners and credit card fees. The significant amount of equipment required to be deployed before we add subscribers results in substantial amounts of cost related to depreciation expense. We consider depreciation expense to be a fixed cost. These fixed costs have a significant impact on the minimum amount of revenues required to achieve gross profit, which would have been $79.8 million and $60.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs that include salaries and wages, commissions, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and certain employee expenses along with software and equipment expenses, recruiting expenses, professional fees, depreciation expenses, facilities related expenses, marketing expenses, and other fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount to keep pace with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, that includes the incremental costs associated with SEC compliance, legal, audit, insurance and investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development activities help to increase our network capacity over time and further improve our unit economics by reducing the cost of network elements.\nResearch and development expenses include, but are not limited to, costs incurred in performing engineering and prototype manufacturing activities relating to our products and services, including salaries, benefits, facilities, rent, software, depreciation, research-related overhead expenses, contracted services, license fees, and other external costs. Such expenses are critical to supporting our innovative low-cost hardware and cloud-based software solutions, including increasing capacity and decreasing cost over time.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in new technologies to achieve our operational and commercial goals of expanding our capacity and lowering costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest (both cash and non-cash) incurred on our debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of the fair value adjustments related to our derivative liability and the loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our interest-bearing

31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of an increase in our customer relationships primarily driven by further network expansion in the markets we serve (i.e., an increase in homes serviceable) and increased penetration.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased by $19.8 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases of $9.7 million in deployed equipment depreciation related to our network expansion, $1.6 million in rental payments related to our base stations and revenue share payments to our building owners, $2.8 million related to headcount growth in customer service and national network operations, $2.4 million in fiber costs, $1.1 million in inventory reserves and write-offs and $0.6 million of incremental expenses related to additional fleet vehicles needed to expand our service capabilities in the markets we serve.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.9 million, or 21.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $5.9 million in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million in marketing costs, $0.9 million in software subscriptions, $0.7 million in outside consulting professional fees, $0.4 million in employee travel costs, $0.4 million in rent expense, $0.3 million in business insurance and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $1.7 million in salaries and benefits, $0.6 million in engineering related costs and $0.4 million in consulting services.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $5.4 million, or 27.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in paid-in-kind interest expense of $2.7 million incurred on the Starry Credit Agreement (as defined below) and amortization of debt discounts of $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the issuance of $31.2 million of the 2020 Notes (as defined below) in September 2020 and the detachable warrants issued with the Starry Credit Agreement. Such increase also included the amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million.\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net increased by $10.5 million, or 577.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of the derivative liability recorded for the accelerated repayment feature on the Term Loans (as defined below). See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet loss\nNet loss attributable to our shareholders increased by $41.5 million, or 33.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the factors described above.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Addressable Households\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,691,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,691,029 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Homes Serviceable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,307,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,162,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Relationships\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,495 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Penetration of Homes Serviceable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.83 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,826 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per User (\u201cARPU\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(166,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(125,093 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (000s)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,745 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(83,590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Addressable Households\nAddressable Households are the estimated total number of households within our service territory that we could serve in the markets where we intend to deploy or have deployed a network, assuming the network was fully built and we could serve every household. We calculate the Addressable Households by counting the total households within our spectrum license areas meeting a specified threshold of household density. Addressable Households grows as we begin to execute plans to expand our network in new markets or in new parts of existing markets, and will follow a growth trend as we expand the network. Growth in Addressable Households precedes growth in Homes Serviceable.\nAddressable Households remained unchanged from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 because we did not add new markets during such period and continued to expand within the existing markets we serve by deploying incremental network assets.\nHomes Serviceable\nHomes Serviceable are the estimated households that we could serve using the network that we have deployed in our markets at a given date. This is a subset of the Addressable Households and reflects the size of the network we have deployed as well as the households that we can technologically and commercially serve. Homes Serviceable is a count of all of the households that fall within the coverage area of our deployed network, and will grow as we continue to deploy our network in existing markets and as we deploy in new markets as we expand our Addressable Households.\nHomes Serviceable increased by 1.1 million, or 27.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to the deployment of incremental network assets within the markets that we serve.\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer Relationships include customers who have signed up for a service and all units that are billed under our bulk billing arrangements where a building owner, association, or other third-party is invoiced for a specific number of units within multiple dwelling unit buildings. Customer Relationships include Starry internet service, currently our only service, and will include unique relationships for small and medium size business service, voice service, and potentially other services in the future.\nCustomer Relationships increased by 28.7 thousand, or 83.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to new customers signing up for our services and additional bulk billing arrangements for such services sold to third parties who manage or own multifamily dwelling unit buildings.\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable is the ratio of the total number of Customer Relationships to the total number of Homes Serviceable and represents the percentage of households that can receive service with which we have developed a Customer Relationship. Penetration of Homes Serviceable grows as markets mature, but may fluctuate depending on the pace of our network expansion if growth in the denominator (Homes Serviceable) significantly outpaces the numerator (Customer Relationships).\nAverage revenue per user (\u201cARPU\u201d)\nWe use ARPU to evaluate and monitor the amount of revenue generated by customers and analyze growth patterns. ARPU values represent total revenue divided by the average number of customer relationships at the beginning and end of each period, divided by the number of months in the period.\nWe believe ARPU is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. ARPU and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of ARPU may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nARPU decreased by $1.71, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the use of customer promotional plans to increase penetration in the markets that we serve.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is determined based on EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), adjusted to exclude certain unusual or non-recurring items, certain non-cash items and other items that are not indicative of ongoing operations (including stock-based compensation expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities). Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by management, research analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies. We believe that this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure not defined under GAAP. It has limitations, because it excludes certain types of expenses and it does not reflect changes in working capital needs. Furthermore, other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly entitled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented here as a supplemental measure only. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment.\nFor a historical reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, please refer to the table below.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP Net Loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(166,545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(125,093 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(112,344 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86,400 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Fair value adjustment of derivative liability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Share-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>960 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,745 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(83,590 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table> Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe are an early-stage growth company and have generated losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. Our principal sources of liquidity have been generated through a combination of cash flows from borrowings and the issuances equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be used to execute on our strategic initiatives through (i) investing in our technology, (ii) expanding our domestic footprint and (iii) hiring personnel. We require additional capital investment to execute the strategic business plan to grow its subscriber base in existing markets from already-deployed network assets and launch services in new markets. Management plans to raise additional capital through a combination of potential options, including but not limited to, equity and debt financings.\nAdditional equity financing may not be available on favorable terms and could be dilutive to current stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments.\nOur ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our expansion efforts and other operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of this uncertainty, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued.\nAt December 31, 2021 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million and consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts, of which $15.0 million cannot be accessed in accordance with the Starry Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2022, the Business Combination was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $36.2 million. Following the SPAC Merger Effective Time and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Date, (a) the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $109.0 million, and (b) the sale of the Series Z Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $31.0 million. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nStarry Credit Agreement\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement among Starry, Starry Spectrum Holdings LLC, Starry (MA), Inc., Starry Spectrum LLC, Testco LLC, Widmo Holdings LLC and Vibrant Composites Inc., as borrowers, the lenders party thereto from time to time and ArrowMark Agency Services, LLC, as administrative agent, as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the \u201cStarry Credit Agreement\u201d) to provide a total of $50.0 million in two separate loan tranches, $27.5 million and $22.5 million, and drew on the full amount of each tranche in February 2019 and June 2019, respectively. In December 2019, we amended the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional loan tranche of $75.0 million, which we immediately drew upon in full (collectively, the \u201c2019 Term Loans\u201d).\nIn June 2021, we entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver to the Starry Credit Agreement (the \u201cThird Amendment and Waiver\u201d). The Third Amendment and Waiver amended and restated two affirmative covenants that we were not in compliance with as of December 31, 2020, including extending the time period in which we are required to deliver audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis and extending the time period in which we are required to deliver a budget for fiscal year 2021. The non-compliance with covenants is an event of default which would have required the outstanding long-term debt balance to be payable upon demand. In addition to the amendment and restatement, the Third Amendment and Waiver waived any events of default in existence on the Third Amendment and Waiver effective date. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nIn conjunction with entering into the 2019 Term Loans, we issued warrants to the lender in two tranches in February 2019 and December 2019 of 17.6 million and 15.0 million, respectively.\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional tranche of $40.0 million which we immediately drew upon in full (\u201cTranche C Term Loan\u201d) and up to an additional $10.0 million in delayed draw loans (\u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Loan\u201d) (collectively, with the Tranche C Term Loan and 2019 Term Loans, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d).\nIn conjunction with entering into the Tranche C Term Loan, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement as of October 6, 2021 (the \u201cWarrant Purchase Agreement\u201d), and issued to the lenders warrants to purchase 11.5 million shares (the \u201cInitial Tranche C Warrants\u201d). Warrants to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares are contingently issuable subject to our drawing down on the Delayed Draw Tranche C Loan (the \u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Initial Tranche C Warrants, the \u201cTranche C Warrants\u201d). Upon issuance of such warrants, 25% immediately vested and became exercisable. As the Business Combination closed prior to April 15, 2022, the Tranche C Warrants are exercisable solely with respect to the 25% of the warrant shares that vested immediately upon issuance, whereas the remaining 75% of unvested warrants were forfeited. We determined the fair value per share of our underlying Common Stock of the Warrant Purchase Agreement to be $1.81 per the terms of the Business Combination.\nThe loans incur interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), subject to a floor of 2.0% plus an applicable margin of 9.0%, capped at 13.25% annually. Pursuant to the Starry Credit Agreement, we elected to pay the accrued interest on an in-kind basis by increasing the principal balance outstanding, payable in its entirety at maturity in February 2024. Outstanding borrowings plus accrued paid-in-kind interest were $202.7 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had deferred financing costs and discounts on warrants on these loans in the amount of $2.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively.\nOn March 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement amended and restated an affirmative covenant requiring the Company to provide annual audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis. In addition, the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement redefined the term \u201cChange in Control\u201d to exclude the aforementioned Business Combination with respect to contemplating the prepayment penalty. As a result of such amendments, the Company was in compliance with all bank covenants as of December 31, 2021. Without such amendments the Company would have been in default and the outstanding long-term debt balance would be payable upon demand. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nCapital lease obligations\nThroughout the period we entered into capital leases for vehicles and equipment with various vendors with payments due monthly extending through 2025. As of December 31, 2021, we owed $2.2 million under such lease obligations.\nStrategic partner arrangement\nIn June 2020, we entered into a 10-year arrangement (the \u201cStrategic Partner Arrangement\u201d) with AEPV to jointly deploy a fixed wireless broadband network in a new market. AEPV has agreed to fund the equipment necessary to deliver the service in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement whereby they will be entitled to a percentage of revenue earned by us in the new market. Pursuant to the arrangement, we will sell in exchange for\ncash consideration the equipment to AEPV and lease the equipment back. The seller-financing portion of the transaction created a form of continuing involvement which precludes sale-leaseback accounting until the related amounts due are paid in full. Accordingly, we accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction with AEPV, with the equipment remaining on our books at its then carrying value, the net cash proceeds received being reflected as a financing obligation, and the expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement to the third party being treated as debt service applied to interest and principal over the initial 10-year term. The discount rate is calculated based on expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement. AEPV has the right to terminate the arrangement for any reason no earlier than June 2023. In the event of an early termination, we are required to repurchase the equipment at a repurchase price equal to the net book value of the equipment as reflected on the third party's balance sheet at the time of termination. We have made an accounting policy election to use the prospective method to account for changes in actual or estimated cash flows related to the debt service. See \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and contingencies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase commitments\nThroughout the period we entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various contract manufacturers to purchase materials and associated support to maintain and improve our existing distribution system as well as build out new networks and distribution systems. As of December 31, 2021, we had non-cancelable commitments totaling $33.4 million.\nConvertible notes payable\nIn September 2020, we issued convertible notes (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $31.2 million. The 2020 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and matured in June 2021. In 2021 and 2020, such notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such proceeds were used for building out the network and general working capital purposes.\nOne current shareholder who is a related party purchased approximately $2.3 million of the 2020 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn January 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cJanuary 2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $6.0 million. The January 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the January 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nIn March 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cMarch 2021 Notes\u201d and, together with the January 2021 Notes, the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $5.0 million. The March 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the March 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nTwo current shareholders who are related parties purchased $3.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively of the 2021 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn March 2021, we closed on an issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), generating cash proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $119.9 million and converted all $42.8 million of our outstanding 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes into shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nShort term liquidity requirements\nAs a growth company, the net losses we have incurred since inception are in accordance with our strategy and forecast. We will continue to incur net losses in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to expand our platform development to improve our existing technology and expand into new markets.\nWe incurred a net loss of $166.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net loss of $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our current assets were $43.9 million, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million, which are primarily deposited with financial institutions, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.1 million and deferred costs of $7.0 million, and our current liabilities were $33.1 million, consisting of accounts payable totaling $6.8 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities totaling $23.2 million, unearned revenue totaling $1.6 million, and the current portion of our debt totaling $1.5 million.\nLong term liquidity requirements\nAs a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, the sale of the PIPE Shares and the sale of the Series Z Shares, we successfully raised gross proceeds of $36.2 million, $109.0 million and $31.0 million, respectively. However, our existing capital resources may be insufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements. We may be required to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through either further equity or debt financing. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. The terms of additional debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto:\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,583 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(78,945 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68,903 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,906 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(51,535 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash used in operating activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in operating activities was $98.6 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $166.5 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $70.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts of $2.3 million. The adjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $29.5 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans, the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes and the Strategic Partner Arrangement of $18.2 million, (iii) amortization of debt discounts and deferred charges of $5.4 million, (iv) conversion of the convertible debt discount of $1.0 million, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.7 million, (vi) fair value adjustment of the derivative liability of $8.6 million, (vii) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $2.2 million, (viii) $1.3 million in share-based compensation expense, (ix) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.2 million and (x) provision for doubtful accounts of less than $0.2 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $3.5 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (ii) $0.8 million in other liabilities, and (iii) $0.5 million in unearned revenue, offset by decreases of (i) $5.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, (ii) $1.2 million in accounts payable, (iii) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (iv) $0.2 million in other assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in operating activities was $78.9 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $125.1 million, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of $43.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts and certain non-cash expenses of $3.0 million. The\nadjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $19.4 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans and the 2020 Notes of $15.4 million, (iii) amortization of debt discount of $3.8 million, (iv) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.5 million, (v) fair value adjustment to a derivative liability of $1.9 million, (vi) $1.0 million in share-based compensation expense, (vii) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.1 million and (viii) provision for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $1.2 million in other liabilities, (ii) $0.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (iii) $0.7 million in accounts payable, (iv) $0.8 million in unearned revenue, (v) and $0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by decreases of (i) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (ii) less than $0.1 million in other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $68.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $171.4 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), net of issuance costs, of $119.9 million, proceeds from Term Loans, net of issuance costs, of $38.5 million, proceeds from the issuance of $11.0 million of the 2021 Notes, proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $3.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of Starry Options (as defined below) of $0.8 million, offset by repayments of capital lease obligations of $0.8 million, payments of deferred transaction costs of $1.0 million and payments of third-party issuance costs of $0.3 million in connection with the Term Loans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $63.3 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the (i) issuance of Starry Series D Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, of $30.7 million, (ii) issuance of convertible notes of $31.2 million, (iii) proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $1.7 million and (iv) exercise of Starry Options of $0.2 million, partially offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations of $0.6 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies require a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimating fair value of Starry's Common Stock for Share-Based Compensation\nAs a company with no active public market for its common stock prior to the Business Combination, Starry's board of directors periodically determines the fair value of Starry's common stock at various dates, with the assistance of management and an independent third-party valuation specialist. In connection with establishing the exercise price for all share-based awards and estimating the fair value of Starry's common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we obtained third-party valuations by an independent valuation firm. The valuations dated as of May 15, 2021, March 30, 2021, March 31, 2020 and March 6, 2019, were conducted in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation utilizing the income approach for the May 15, 2021 and March 31, 2020 valuation and the market approach for the March 30, 2021 and March 6, 2019 valuations. The market approach was chosen as the primary valuation process for the March 2021 and March 2019 valuations due to our entering into transactions relating to our stock around the dates of valuation. The income approach was chosen for the May 2021 and March 2020 valuations because no recent stock transactions had taken place around the valuation dates and the approach takes into consideration the expectation of future cash flows that drives value to our shareholders.\nAn income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow analysis incorporating our projections, our historical financials, and guideline company / industry growth and margin indications, was utilized. The income approach estimates our value based on the expectation of future cash flows that we will generate that are discounted to the present using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with us and our projections. The selected discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital as well as consideration given to historical venture capital rates commensurate with an expansion-stage to bridge-stage company. A discounted cash flow analysis was developed based on discussions with management, projected financial data prepared by us, historical financial statements, and guideline company and industry growth indicators.\nThe market approach measures the value of an asset or business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments or assets. When applied to the valuation of equity interests, consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the entity being appraised relative to those publicly traded in similar lines of business. The valuation specialist applied the backsolve method to derive our implied equity value from a transaction involving our own securities. In deriving this value, specific consideration is given to the rights and preferences of each class of equity and solving for the total equity value implied by the recent transaction in our securities.\nFor all valuations, the implied equity value was then allocated between classes of the Starry Series A Preferred Stock, Starry Series B Preferred Stock, Starry Series C Preferred Stock, Starry Series D Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock, Starry Series Seed Preferred Stock and Starry Series Z Preferred Stock (collectively, the \u201cStarry Preferred Stock\u201d) and Starry's common stock using an Option Pricing Model (\u201cOPM\u201d), whereby the Starry Preferred Stock and Starry's common stock were treated as call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the stock class. The total value for each class of equity was then divided by the respective shares outstanding for that class to determine the per share value. A discount for lack of marketability was then applied to account for the lack of liquidity and marketability of the stock. The resulting value per share was the indicated present value, on a non-marketable and minority basis.\nFor the valuations used to establish the fair value of Starry's common stock, the following assumptions were used:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 15,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 30,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 6,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility - DLOM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Probability weighted time to exit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lack of marketability\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of common stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThere is inherent uncertainty in our forecasts and projections, and if we had made different assumptions and estimates than those described previously, the amount of our beneficial conversion feature, share-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share amounts could have been materially different.\nSubsequent to the close of the Business Combination on March 29, 2022, the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant of a share-based award will be based on the market value at the time of each grant.\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated by sales of our internet services. The timing of such revenue recognition is based on the period that such services are consumed by the customer. The transaction price associated with our contracts often includes variable consideration. This variable consideration we consider to be constrained and is included only to the extent we believe it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nOur contracts with customers also may include service level agreements that entitle the customer to receive service credits and refunds if it is deemed that minimum service levels are not met. We estimate the amount of such credits and refunds based on our assessment of legal enforceability, anticipated performance, and historical trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant incidents of not meeting service level requirements.\nWe have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not recognize a significant financing component on contracts that are less than one year. We also exclude sales taxes and other government-assessed and imposed taxes from its revenue, when applicable.\nWe use marketing incentives to solicit potential subscriber interest in our services, including the issuance of gift cards. Such promotional gift cards represent consideration paid to potential customers in anticipation of a contract and are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nIncome taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recorded no income tax provision and have recorded a full valuation allowance for all periods. The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax attributes including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and R&D tax credit carryforwards.\nOur policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts have been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-based compensation\nWe account for share-based payments that involve the issuance of shares of Starry's common stock to employees and nonemployees and meet the criteria for equity-classified awards as share-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We issue awards of stock options to purchase shares of Starry common stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any warrants to purchase shares of Starry common stock, the \u201cStarry Options\u201d) to employees, members of the Starry board of directors, and non-employees under the Starry's Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Option and Grant Plan, as amended (\u201cStarry Stock Plan\u201d). We believe the fair value of share-based awards granted to nonemployees is more readily determinable than the fair value of the services received.\nWe estimate the fair value of Starry Options granted at each grant date using the Black Scholes model which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:\n \u2022 the length of time grantees will retain their vested Starry Options before exercising them for employees and the contractual term of the option for nonemployees (\u201cexpected term\u201d); \n \u2022 the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term; \n \u2022 the expected dividends; \n \u2022 the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term; and \n \u2022 the fair value of Starry's common stock. \nA summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of Starry Options during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8% - 28.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0% - 28.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 - 6.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 - 6.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8% - 1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4% - 1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Expected volatility - The expected volatility was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers, as we did not have any trading history for Starry's common stock. \n \u2022 Expected term - For employees, the expected term is determined using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, as prescribed by the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to estimate on a formula basis the expected term of the Starry Options which are considered to have \u201cplain vanilla\u201d characteristics. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate was based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury instruments with terms that were consistent with the expected term of Starry Options and, \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield was based on our history and management's current expectation regarding future dividends.  If factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, share-based compensation cost on future award grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants. Higher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant. Future share-based compensation cost will increase to the extent that we grant additional share-based awards to employees and non-employees. If there are any modifications or cancelations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur incremental cost. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses and our research and development expenses.\nBased on our estimated fair value of Starry's common stock of $1.81 as of December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of the vested and unvested Starry Options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was $58.5 million.\nBeneficial conversion features associated with convertible notes\nWe issued convertible notes in September 2020, January 2021, and March 2021. Upon assessment of the embedded elements in these agreements, we identified that the automatic conversion feature upon maturity clauses contain a beneficial conversion feature that required separate accounting from the host contract.\nIn order to quantify the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature, we compared the current fair value of the Starry Series D Preferred Stock to the contractual conversion price using the fair value of Starry's common stock as of March 2021 and 2020. We used the input of the estimated fair value of Starry's common stock as the midpoint between the valuations at each date during the period to arrive at the intrinsic value. The beneficial conversion features related to the 2020 Notes, the January 2021 Notes and the March 2021 Notes were $3.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of $1.8 million and $0.2 million in paid-in-kind interest for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, we completed the initial closing of a new equity financing for Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock). As a result of the closing, the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes converted to shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively. We concluded the conversion of the 2020 Notes was treated as an accounting conversion in accordance with the original terms of the 2020 Notes and as a result carrying value of the 2020 Notes was reclassified to Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock. The conversion of the 2021 Notes was treated as an extinguishment of the 2021 Notes which included marking the Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock to fair value by way of recording a charge to the capital account of $2.8 million representing the additional value provided to the holders of the 2021 Notes upon settlement. We recorded a loss of $2.4 million upon extinguishment of the 2021 Notes.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of spectrum licenses acquired through FCC Auction 102 in June 2019 (the \u201cFCC licenses\u201d). The FCC licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless services. While the FCC licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, ten years for our licenses, the licenses are issued with a regulatory expectation of renewal which are routinely granted and with nominal cost.\nAt acquisition and each assessment period, we consider whether the FCC licenses should be definite or indefinite lived. The FCC licenses are not limited in their useful lives, nor is there an anticipation of another technology to replace the underlying technology. We believe that based on these factors that the FCC licenses are indefinite lived intangibles.\nThe FCC licenses are tested for potential impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), provides the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. ASC 350 permits us to elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. As of October 1, 2021, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment due to the passage of time and used a market-based approach that did not result in impairment. As of October 1, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment that did not identify any indicators of impairment that would require a quantitative assessment to be performed.\nCapitalization of internal labor costs\nOur business is capital intensive and a large portion of our working capital is spent on activities associated with expanding our distribution system. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying amount of our distribution systems was $92.0 million and $67.3 million, respectively, representing approximately 42% and 41%, respectively, of our total assets.\nCosts associated with distribution system construction and customer installations are capitalized as part of the asset cost. Such capitalized costs include materials, use tax, freight-in, third party labor, internal labor and the associated fringe benefits incurred to bring the distribution system to its intended use. We capitalize such internal labor costs by estimating the amount of time spent on such activities by employees who are responsible for our distribution system construction and customer installations. We capitalized internal labor costs of $17.8 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our activities could affect management's judgment about how we calculate and capitalize internal labor in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and perform updates to such policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances, such as the development of new products and services which may impact the utilization of our employees who construct our distribution system and perform customer installations.\nAsset retirement obligation (\u201cARO\u201d)\nWe lease space on vertical assets (\u201cVA\u201d) on which we install our Starry Titan base stations, and we enter into agreements with multiple dwelling unit (\u201cMDU\u201d) managers or owners to install our Starry Trident transceivers to provide service to the building. These agreements can include language regarding our responsibility to remove equipment and repair the asset to which the Starry equipment was attached (either a VA or a MDU) upon termination of the agreement. The agreements create an obligation associated with the future retirement of the equipment after normal operation of the equipment for the duration of the equipment's life.\nAsset retirement obligations are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be established. Once the fair value of future cash flows has been discounted to present value, the liability is recorded with an offsetting increase to an ARO long-lived asset that is recorded within property and equipment. Subsequent changes to the assets and liabilities are recognized in the period they occur.\nAs the estimated life of the ARO lapses, we recognize depreciation expense for the ARO asset and accretion expense for the ARO liability.\nIf factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, ARO on future MDU and VA equipment installations may differ significantly from ARO on past MDU and VA equipment installations. Higher credit adjusted risk free rates and inflation rates result in an increase to ARO determined at the date of installation. The assumptions and inputs from management, based on information known to us as of each reporting period include:\n \u2022 the rate of inflation \n \u2022 the adjusted risk-free rate \n \u2022 the life of the lease \n \u2022 anticipated costs to of removal \n \u2022 anticipated costs of restoration \nIn future periods, we expect amortization of our long-lived assets associated with the ARO as well as accretion of the ARO to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized amortization and accretion expense, as well as to the AROs associated with future equipment deployments.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSee \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements issued, not yet adopted\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and our assessment, to the extent we made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act allows emerging growth companies to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under Section 107, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Any decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We have elected to use the extended transition period available under the JOBS Act.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other factors set forth in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been reported previously in our final prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) (File No. 333-260847), filed with the SEC on February 15, 2022, under the heading \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Starry.\u201d\nOverview\nWe have developed a unique and innovative solution to provide last mile fixed broadband using a proprietary fixed wireless technology stack operating in licensed spectrum. We design and build our own fixed wireless equipment, cloud-based network control plane and billing and operations support systems to run our network and provide our service. We deploy this technology across a variety of markets to provide a robust and competitively-priced broadband service to customers. The integration of our own technology and service delivery allows us to efficiently deploy new competitive broadband networks to connect communities across the country.\nSince our inception, we have developed the technology, optimized the unit economics, acquired spectrum and deployed our network and acquired subscribers in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C., and Columbus.\nBusiness Combination and Public Company Costs\nOn October 6, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with FirstMark, Merger Sub and Starry. The Business Combination was consummated whereby: (a) on March 28, 2022, FirstMark merged with and into Starry Group, with Starry Group surviving the SPAC Merger as a publicly traded entity and became the sole owner of Merger Sub, and (b) on March 29, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Starry, with Starry surviving the Acquisition Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Starry Group.\nNotwithstanding the legal form of the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Under this method of accounting, FirstMark is treated as the acquired company and Starry is treated as the accounting acquirer and the Business Combination is treated as the equivalent of Starry issuing stock for the net assets of FirstMark, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of FirstMark are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects and the financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Starry in many respects.\nThe most significant change in our future reported financial position and results are expected to be an estimated increase in cash (as compared to our balance sheet at December 31, 2021) of approximately $155.7 million, including $109.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the PIPE Shares and $31.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the Series Z Shares consummated substantially simultaneously with the Business Combination. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nAs a consequence of the Business Combination, we became an SEC-registered and NYSE-listed company, which has required and will continue to require us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting, legal and administrative resources, including increased audit and legal fees.\nAdditionally, we expect both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n \u2022 continue to invest in our technology to improve capacity and reduce cost; \n \u2022 deploy our network technology and capital equipment in additional domestic markets; \n \u2022 sign up new subscribers; \n \u2022 hire additional personnel; \n \u2022 obtain, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property and FCC spectrum license portfolio; and \n \u2022 operate as a public company. \nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNetwork Deployment\nWe have deployed our fixed wireless network in six markets to date, covering approximately 5.3 million households by the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. The number of markets that we anticipate launching per year is variable and depends on our capital allocation strategy; the competitive environment for internet services nationally, regionally, and locally at a point in time; government obligations, including our obligations under RDOF and any additional subsidy programs in which we might participate; new partnerships and other factors. We anticipate launching our network in one to six or more markets per year over the near to medium term.\nThe deployment of fixed wireless networks involves installing our base stations on tall vertical assets, which are connected to the internet through backhaul connections to the base stations, routed through a point-of-presence in the market. These networks serve the end customer locations, at which we install a transceiver to receive the signal, and a Wi-Fi router in the premises to deliver the service. We then use these networks to provide service to our customers for a fee. The speed and scale of these deployments impact the universe of customers that we can serve, and therefore our revenues.\nIn order to effectively manage supply chain to help meet product demand, we had $3.8 million in prepaid inventory as of December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Demand\nWe sell a stand-alone broadband product for a flat monthly fee. Broadband demand continues to grow, and broadband plays an essential role in society - it is used for education, work, healthcare, and entertainment. Consumer demand for broadband is incredibly robust, and we expect it to continue to grow into the future. However, to the extent consumer sentiment towards broadband services changes, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nCustomer Acquisition\nWe acquire customers through three primary sales strategies. First, for larger apartment and condominium buildings, we enter into simple access agreements with the building owners or associations, as applicable, giving us permission to install our transceiver and use the buildings' wiring to provide the service to their residents. Then, we sell the service directly to the residents. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person events, email, and traditional mail. Second, for small apartment and condominium buildings and single-family homes we sell the service directly to the consumer through digital marketing channels, email, traditional mail, and outdoor media. We then obtain permission from the resident to install our transceiver at the building or single-family home as part of the account creation process. Third, for apartment and condominium\nbuildings of various sizes, we enter into bulk billing agreements where the building owner, association, or other third party (e.g., a management company or short-term rental company) purchases the service for a specified number of units at the building and pays us directly for such services. We use a variety of marketing techniques for these sales and acquisition efforts, including in person meetings and email. To the extent that these efforts are unsuccessful, it would impact our customer penetration and therefore our revenues.\nSeasonality and Housing Trends\nOur customers today are all residential subscribers, and the majority of our customers in the future will continue to be residential subscribers. There are some seasonal trends that affect our customer acquisition activities, and they can vary by market. Examples include markets with larger college and university student populations, which tend to move in and move out of residences within the same time frame. In addition, consumers naturally consider their broadband provider at the time at which they move to a new residence. To the extent that the velocity of moving changes over time, it would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nIncumbent Competition\nWe compete with several large incumbent fixed wireline providers, which can vary by market. In some instances, we also compete with mobile providers to the extent that an individual consumer considers a mobile service a substitute for a fixed service. We have built our business to allow us to compete effectively with very low penetration rates in any market, and by offering very competitive pricing. In any market, an incumbent provider may engage in promotional activities or price competition, which would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenues.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe conduct business through one operating segment. See \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Components of Statements of Operations\nRevenues\nWe deliver high speed and competitively priced broadband service and related support on a subscription basis to our customers in the Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C. and Columbus markets using innovative and proprietary wireless technology. Our subscription rate for such services is a per-month fixed price, without data caps or additional fees. Most of our customers are month-to-month individual subscribers who do not have long-term commitments contracts with us, but a small number are building owners or property management companies who have a commercial arrangement with us whereby such customers compensate us directly for providing our internet services in their buildings.\nWe expect our revenues to continue to increase as we acquire new subscribers in existing markets and new markets we plan to enter, and as we introduce new products and services.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues includes, but is not limited to, costs incurred supporting national network service costs, fiber backhaul costs, site rent and utilities, customer care and national operations personnel, freight charges, deployed equipment costs, associated depreciation and vehicle-related expenses among other costs.\nWe expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow in our existing markets as well as expand into new markets. Historically, approximately 15% of our cost of revenues have been variable costs whereas approximately 85% have been fixed costs. Variable costs include direct costs related to subscriber growth as well as customer care, revenue share payments to building owners and credit card fees. The significant amount of equipment required to be deployed before we add subscribers results in substantial amounts of cost related to depreciation expense. We consider depreciation expense to be a fixed cost. These fixed costs have a significant impact on the minimum amount of revenues required to achieve gross profit, which would have been $79.8 million and $60.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs that include salaries and wages, commissions, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and certain employee expenses along with software and equipment expenses, recruiting expenses, professional fees, depreciation expenses, facilities related expenses, marketing expenses, and other fees.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount to keep pace with the growth of our business, and as a result of operating as a public company, that includes the incremental costs associated with SEC compliance, legal, audit, insurance and investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development activities help to increase our network capacity over time and further improve our unit economics by reducing the cost of network elements.\nResearch and development expenses include, but are not limited to, costs incurred in performing engineering and prototype manufacturing activities relating to our products and services, including salaries, benefits, facilities, rent, software, depreciation, research-related overhead expenses, contracted services, license fees, and other external costs. Such expenses are critical to supporting our innovative low-cost hardware and cloud-based software solutions, including increasing capacity and decreasing cost over time.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in new technologies to achieve our operational and commercial goals of expanding our capacity and lowering costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest (both cash and non-cash) incurred on our debt obligations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of the fair value adjustments related to our derivative liability and the loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by interest income earned on our interest-bearing accounts.\nResults of Operations\nComparison for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except shares):\n\nRevenues\nRevenues grew by $9.4 million, or 73.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of an increase in our customer relationships primarily driven by further network expansion in the markets we serve (i.e., an increase in homes serviceable) and increased penetration.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues increased by $19.8 million, or 51.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases of $9.7 million in deployed equipment depreciation related to our network expansion, $1.6 million in rental payments related to our base stations and revenue share payments to our building owners, $2.8 million related to headcount growth in customer service and national network operations, $2.4 million in fiber costs, $1.1 million in inventory reserves and write-offs and $0.6 million of incremental expenses related to additional fleet vehicles needed to expand our service capabilities in the markets we serve.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.9 million, or 21.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $5.9 million in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million in marketing costs, $0.9 million in software subscriptions, $0.7 million in outside consulting professional fees, $0.4 million in employee travel costs, $0.4 million in rent expense, $0.3 million in business insurance and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $3.4 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by increases of $1.7 million in salaries and benefits, $0.6 million in engineering related costs and $0.4 million in consulting services.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased by $5.4 million, or 27.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in paid-in-kind interest expense of $2.7 million incurred on the Starry Credit Agreement (as defined below) and amortization of debt discounts of $1.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the issuance of $31.2 million of the 2020 Notes (as defined below) in September 2020 and the detachable warrants issued with the Starry Credit Agreement. Such increase also included the amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million.\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net increased by $10.5 million, or 577.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of the derivative liability recorded for the accelerated repayment feature on the Term Loans (as defined below). See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet loss\nNet loss attributable to our shareholders increased by $41.5 million, or 33.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the factors described above.\nKey Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.\nThe following table summarizes our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated:\n Addressable Households\nAddressable Households are the estimated total number of households within our service territory that we could serve in the markets where we intend to deploy or have deployed a network, assuming the network was fully built and we could serve every household. We calculate the Addressable Households by counting the total households within our spectrum license areas meeting a specified threshold of household density. Addressable Households grows as we begin to execute plans to expand our network in new markets or in new parts of existing markets, and will follow a growth trend as we expand the network. Growth in Addressable Households precedes growth in Homes Serviceable.\nAddressable Households remained unchanged from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 because we did not add new markets during such period and continued to expand within the existing markets we serve by deploying incremental network assets.\nHomes Serviceable\nHomes Serviceable are the estimated households that we could serve using the network that we have deployed in our markets at a given date. This is a subset of the Addressable Households and reflects the size of the network we have deployed as well as the households that we can technologically and commercially serve. Homes Serviceable is a count of all of the households that fall within the coverage area of our deployed network, and will grow as we continue to deploy our network in existing markets and as we deploy in new markets as we expand our Addressable Households.\nHomes Serviceable increased by 1.1 million, or 27.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to the deployment of incremental network assets within the markets that we serve.\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer Relationships include customers who have signed up for a service and all units that are billed under our bulk billing arrangements where a building owner, association, or other third-party is invoiced for a specific number of units within multiple dwelling unit buildings. Customer Relationships include Starry internet service, currently our only service, and will include unique relationships for small and medium size business service, voice service, and potentially other services in the future.\nCustomer Relationships increased by 28.7 thousand, or 83.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020. Such increase was primarily due to new customers signing up for our services and additional bulk billing arrangements for such services sold to third parties who manage or own multifamily dwelling unit buildings.\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable\nPenetration of Homes Serviceable is the ratio of the total number of Customer Relationships to the total number of Homes Serviceable and represents the percentage of households that can receive service with which we have developed a Customer Relationship. Penetration of Homes Serviceable grows as markets mature, but may fluctuate depending on the pace of our network expansion if growth in the denominator (Homes Serviceable) significantly outpaces the numerator (Customer Relationships).\nAverage revenue per user (\u201cARPU\u201d)\nWe use ARPU to evaluate and monitor the amount of revenue generated by customers and analyze growth patterns. ARPU values represent total revenue divided by the average number of customer relationships at the beginning and end of each period, divided by the number of months in the period.\nWe believe ARPU is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. ARPU and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry, although our measure of ARPU may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nARPU decreased by $1.71, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the use of customer promotional plans to increase penetration in the markets that we serve.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is determined based on EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), adjusted to exclude certain unusual or non-recurring items, certain non-cash items and other items that are not indicative of ongoing operations (including stock-based compensation expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and the fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities). Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by management, research analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies. We believe that this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a measure not defined under GAAP. It has limitations, because it excludes certain types of expenses and it does not reflect changes in working capital needs. Furthermore, other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly entitled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented here as a supplemental measure only. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment.\nFor a historical reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, please refer to the table below.\n Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe are an early-stage growth company and have generated losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since inception. Our principal sources of liquidity have been generated through a combination of cash flows from borrowings and the issuances equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be used to execute on our strategic initiatives through (i) investing in our technology, (ii) expanding our domestic footprint and (iii) hiring personnel. We require additional capital investment to execute the strategic business plan to grow its subscriber base in existing markets from already-deployed network assets and launch services in new markets. Management plans to raise additional capital through a combination of potential options, including but not limited to, equity and debt financings.\nAdditional equity financing may not be available on favorable terms and could be dilutive to current stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments.\nOur ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our expansion efforts and other operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of this uncertainty, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that these consolidated financial statements were issued.\nAt December 31, 2021 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million and consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts, of which $15.0 million cannot be accessed in accordance with the Starry Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2022, the Business Combination was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $36.2 million. Following the SPAC Merger Effective Time and immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger Effective Date, (a) the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $109.0 million, and (b) the sale of the Series Z Shares was consummated, resulting in gross proceeds of $31.0 million. Total direct and incremental transaction costs are estimated at approximately $18.5 million.\nStarry Credit Agreement\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement among Starry, Starry Spectrum Holdings LLC, Starry (MA), Inc., Starry Spectrum LLC, Testco LLC, Widmo Holdings LLC and Vibrant Composites Inc., as borrowers, the lenders party thereto from time to time and ArrowMark Agency Services, LLC, as administrative agent, as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the \u201cStarry Credit Agreement\u201d) to provide a total of $50.0 million in two separate loan tranches, $27.5 million and $22.5 million, and drew on the full amount of each tranche in February 2019 and June 2019, respectively. In December 2019, we amended the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional loan tranche of $75.0 million, which we immediately drew upon in full (collectively, the \u201c2019 Term Loans\u201d).\nIn June 2021, we entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver to the Starry Credit Agreement (the \u201cThird Amendment and Waiver\u201d). The Third Amendment and Waiver amended and restated two affirmative covenants that we were not in compliance with as of December 31, 2020, including extending the time period in which we are required to deliver audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis and extending the time period in which we are required to deliver a budget for fiscal year 2021. The non-compliance with covenants is an event of default which would have required the outstanding long-term debt balance to be payable upon demand. In addition to the amendment and restatement, the Third Amendment and Waiver waived any events of default in existence on the Third Amendment and Waiver effective date. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nIn conjunction with entering into the 2019 Term Loans, we issued warrants to the lender in two tranches in February 2019 and December 2019 of 17.6 million and 15.0 million, respectively.\nIn October 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Starry Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders, providing for an additional tranche of $40.0 million which we immediately drew upon in full (\u201cTranche C Term Loan\u201d) and up to an additional $10.0 million in delayed draw loans (\u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Loan\u201d) (collectively, with the Tranche C Term Loan and 2019 Term Loans, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d).\nIn conjunction with entering into the Tranche C Term Loan, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement as of October 6, 2021 (the \u201cWarrant Purchase Agreement\u201d), and issued to the lenders warrants to purchase 11.5 million shares (the \u201cInitial Tranche C Warrants\u201d). Warrants to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares are contingently issuable subject to our drawing down on the Delayed Draw Tranche C Loan (the \u201cDelayed Draw Tranche C Warrants,\u201d and together with the Initial Tranche C Warrants, the \u201cTranche C Warrants\u201d). Upon issuance of such warrants, 25% immediately vested and became exercisable. As the Business Combination closed prior to April 15, 2022, the Tranche C Warrants are exercisable solely with respect to the 25% of the warrant shares that vested immediately upon issuance, whereas the remaining 75% of unvested warrants were forfeited. We determined the fair value per share of our underlying Common Stock of the Warrant Purchase Agreement to be $1.81 per the terms of the Business Combination.\nThe loans incur interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), subject to a floor of 2.0% plus an applicable margin of 9.0%, capped at 13.25% annually. Pursuant to the Starry Credit Agreement, we elected to pay the accrued interest on an in-kind basis by increasing the principal balance outstanding, payable in its entirety at maturity in February 2024. Outstanding borrowings plus accrued paid-in-kind interest were $202.7 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had deferred financing costs and discounts on warrants on these loans in the amount of $2.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively.\nOn March 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement amended and restated an affirmative covenant requiring the Company to provide annual audited financial statements without a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or like qualification, exception or emphasis. In addition, the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement redefined the term \u201cChange in Control\u201d to exclude the aforementioned Business Combination with respect to contemplating the prepayment penalty. As a result of such amendments, the Company was in compliance with all bank covenants as of December 31, 2021. Without such amendments the Company would have been in default and the outstanding long-term debt balance would be payable upon demand. The lender has retained all other covenant requirements.\nCapital lease obligations\nThroughout the period we entered into capital leases for vehicles and equipment with various vendors with payments due monthly extending through 2025. As of December 31, 2021, we owed $2.2 million under such lease obligations.\nStrategic partner arrangement\nIn June 2020, we entered into a 10-year arrangement (the \u201cStrategic Partner Arrangement\u201d) with AEPV to jointly deploy a fixed wireless broadband network in a new market. AEPV has agreed to fund the equipment necessary to deliver the service in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement whereby they will be entitled to a percentage of revenue earned by us in the new market. Pursuant to the arrangement, we will sell in exchange for\ncash consideration the equipment to AEPV and lease the equipment back. The seller-financing portion of the transaction created a form of continuing involvement which precludes sale-leaseback accounting until the related amounts due are paid in full. Accordingly, we accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction with AEPV, with the equipment remaining on our books at its then carrying value, the net cash proceeds received being reflected as a financing obligation, and the expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement to the third party being treated as debt service applied to interest and principal over the initial 10-year term. The discount rate is calculated based on expected future payments under the revenue sharing agreement. AEPV has the right to terminate the arrangement for any reason no earlier than June 2023. In the event of an early termination, we are required to repurchase the equipment at a repurchase price equal to the net book value of the equipment as reflected on the third party's balance sheet at the time of termination. We have made an accounting policy election to use the prospective method to account for changes in actual or estimated cash flows related to the debt service. See \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and contingencies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase commitments\nThroughout the period we entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various contract manufacturers to purchase materials and associated support to maintain and improve our existing distribution system as well as build out new networks and distribution systems. As of December 31, 2021, we had non-cancelable commitments totaling $33.4 million.\nConvertible notes payable\nIn September 2020, we issued convertible notes (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $31.2 million. The 2020 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and matured in June 2021. In 2021 and 2020, such notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Such proceeds were used for building out the network and general working capital purposes.\nOne current shareholder who is a related party purchased approximately $2.3 million of the 2020 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn January 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cJanuary 2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $6.0 million. The January 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the January 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nIn March 2021, we issued convertible notes (the \u201cMarch 2021 Notes\u201d and, together with the January 2021 Notes, the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) payable in exchange for cash totaling $5.0 million. The March 2021 Notes bear interest of 3.0% annually and mature in October 2021. In 2021, the March 2021 Notes accrued paid-in-kind interest of less than $0.1 million.\nTwo current shareholders who are related parties purchased $3.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively of the 2021 Notes. See \u201cNote 4 - Debt\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn March 2021, we closed on an issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), generating cash proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $119.9 million and converted all $42.8 million of our outstanding 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes into shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.\nShort term liquidity requirements\nAs a growth company, the net losses we have incurred since inception are in accordance with our strategy and forecast. We will continue to incur net losses in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to expand our platform development to improve our existing technology and expand into new markets.\nWe incurred a net loss of $166.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net loss of $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, our current assets were $43.9 million, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million, which are primarily deposited with financial institutions, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.1 million and deferred costs of $7.0 million, and our current liabilities were $33.1 million, consisting of accounts payable totaling $6.8 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities totaling $23.2 million, unearned revenue totaling $1.6 million, and the current portion of our debt totaling $1.5 million.\nLong term liquidity requirements\nAs a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, the sale of the PIPE Shares and the sale of the Series Z Shares, we successfully raised gross proceeds of $36.2 million, $109.0 million and $31.0 million, respectively. However, our existing capital resources may be insufficient to meet our long-term liquidity requirements. We may be required to raise additional capital to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through either further equity or debt financing. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock, as applicable. The terms of additional debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto:\n Net cash used in operating activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used in operating activities was $98.6 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $166.5 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $70.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts of $2.3 million. The adjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $29.5 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans, the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes and the Strategic Partner Arrangement of $18.2 million, (iii) amortization of debt discounts and deferred charges of $5.4 million, (iv) conversion of the convertible debt discount of $1.0 million, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.7 million, (vi) fair value adjustment of the derivative liability of $8.6 million, (vii) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $2.2 million, (viii) $1.3 million in share-based compensation expense, (ix) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.2 million and (x) provision for doubtful accounts of less than $0.2 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $3.5 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (ii) $0.8 million in other liabilities, and (iii) $0.5 million in unearned revenue, offset by decreases of (i) $5.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, (ii) $1.2 million in accounts payable, (iii) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (iv) $0.2 million in other assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows used in operating activities was $78.9 million. Such cash used primarily related to our net loss of $125.1 million, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of $43.2 million, and changes in our working capital accounts and certain non-cash expenses of $3.0 million. The\nadjustments for non-cash expenses include (i) $19.4 million in depreciation, (ii) paid-in-kind interest on Term Loans and the 2020 Notes of $15.4 million, (iii) amortization of debt discount of $3.8 million, (iv) loss on disposal of property and equipment of $1.5 million, (v) fair value adjustment to a derivative liability of $1.9 million, (vi) $1.0 million in share-based compensation expense, (vii) accretion of asset retirement obligations of $0.1 million and (viii) provision for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million. The changes in our working capital accounts include increases of (i) $1.2 million in other liabilities, (ii) $0.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, (iii) $0.7 million in accounts payable, (iv) $0.8 million in unearned revenue, (v) and $0.2 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, offset by decreases of (i) $0.3 million in accounts receivable and (ii) less than $0.1 million in other assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $68.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35.9 million, primarily related to capital expenditures for our distribution system.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $171.4 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the issuance of Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock), net of issuance costs, of $119.9 million, proceeds from Term Loans, net of issuance costs, of $38.5 million, proceeds from the issuance of $11.0 million of the 2021 Notes, proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $3.3 million and proceeds from the exercise of Starry Options (as defined below) of $0.8 million, offset by repayments of capital lease obligations of $0.8 million, payments of deferred transaction costs of $1.0 million and payments of third-party issuance costs of $0.3 million in connection with the Term Loans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $63.3 million, which was driven primarily by the proceeds raised from the (i) issuance of Starry Series D Preferred Stock, net of issuance costs, of $30.7 million, (ii) issuance of convertible notes of $31.2 million, (iii) proceeds from the strategic partner arrangement of $1.7 million and (iv) exercise of Starry Options of $0.2 million, partially offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations of $0.6 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies require a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimating fair value of Starry's Common Stock for Share-Based Compensation\nAs a company with no active public market for its common stock prior to the Business Combination, Starry's board of directors periodically determines the fair value of Starry's common stock at various dates, with the assistance of management and an independent third-party valuation specialist. In connection with establishing the exercise price for all share-based awards and estimating the fair value of Starry's common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we obtained third-party valuations by an independent valuation firm. The valuations dated as of May 15, 2021, March 30, 2021, March 31, 2020 and March 6, 2019, were conducted in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Technical Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation utilizing the income approach for the May 15, 2021 and March 31, 2020 valuation and the market approach for the March 30, 2021 and March 6, 2019 valuations. The market approach was chosen as the primary valuation process for the March 2021 and March 2019 valuations due to our entering into transactions relating to our stock around the dates of valuation. The income approach was chosen for the May 2021 and March 2020 valuations because no recent stock transactions had taken place around the valuation dates and the approach takes into consideration the expectation of future cash flows that drives value to our shareholders.\nAn income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow analysis incorporating our projections, our historical financials, and guideline company / industry growth and margin indications, was utilized. The income approach estimates our value based on the expectation of future cash flows that we will generate that are discounted to the present using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with us and our projections. The selected discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital as well as consideration given to historical venture capital rates commensurate with an expansion-stage to bridge-stage company. A discounted cash flow analysis was developed based on discussions with management, projected financial data prepared by us, historical financial statements, and guideline company and industry growth indicators.\nThe market approach measures the value of an asset or business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments or assets. When applied to the valuation of equity interests, consideration is given to the financial condition and operating performance of the entity being appraised relative to those publicly traded in similar lines of business. The valuation specialist applied the backsolve method to derive our implied equity value from a transaction involving our own securities. In deriving this value, specific consideration is given to the rights and preferences of each class of equity and solving for the total equity value implied by the recent transaction in our securities.\nFor all valuations, the implied equity value was then allocated between classes of the Starry Series A Preferred Stock, Starry Series B Preferred Stock, Starry Series C Preferred Stock, Starry Series D Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock, Starry Series Seed Preferred Stock and Starry Series Z Preferred Stock (collectively, the \u201cStarry Preferred Stock\u201d) and Starry's common stock using an Option Pricing Model (\u201cOPM\u201d), whereby the Starry Preferred Stock and Starry's common stock were treated as call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences of the stock class. The total value for each class of equity was then divided by the respective shares outstanding for that class to determine the per share value. A discount for lack of marketability was then applied to account for the lack of liquidity and marketability of the stock. The resulting value per share was the indicated present value, on a non-marketable and minority basis.\nFor the valuations used to establish the fair value of Starry's common stock, the following assumptions were used:\n\nThere is inherent uncertainty in our forecasts and projections, and if we had made different assumptions and estimates than those described previously, the amount of our beneficial conversion feature, share-based compensation expense, net loss, and net loss per share amounts could have been materially different.\nSubsequent to the close of the Business Combination on March 29, 2022, the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant of a share-based award will be based on the market value at the time of each grant.\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated by sales of our internet services. The timing of such revenue recognition is based on the period that such services are consumed by the customer. The transaction price associated with our contracts often includes variable consideration. This variable consideration we consider to be constrained and is included only to the extent we believe it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nOur contracts with customers also may include service level agreements that entitle the customer to receive service credits and refunds if it is deemed that minimum service levels are not met. We estimate the amount of such credits and refunds based on our assessment of legal enforceability, anticipated performance, and historical trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant incidents of not meeting service level requirements.\nWe have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not recognize a significant financing component on contracts that are less than one year. We also exclude sales taxes and other government-assessed and imposed taxes from its revenue, when applicable.\nWe use marketing incentives to solicit potential subscriber interest in our services, including the issuance of gift cards. Such promotional gift cards represent consideration paid to potential customers in anticipation of a contract and are recognized as a reduction to revenue.\nIncome taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recorded no income tax provision and have recorded a full valuation allowance for all periods. The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax attributes including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and R&D tax credit carryforwards.\nOur policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts have been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.\nShare-based compensation\nWe account for share-based payments that involve the issuance of shares of Starry's common stock to employees and nonemployees and meet the criteria for equity-classified awards as share-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We issue awards of stock options to purchase shares of Starry common stock (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any warrants to purchase shares of Starry common stock, the \u201cStarry Options\u201d) to employees, members of the Starry board of directors, and non-employees under the Starry's Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Option and Grant Plan, as amended (\u201cStarry Stock Plan\u201d). We believe the fair value of share-based awards granted to nonemployees is more readily determinable than the fair value of the services received.\nWe estimate the fair value of Starry Options granted at each grant date using the Black Scholes model which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:\n \u2022 the length of time grantees will retain their vested Starry Options before exercising them for employees and the contractual term of the option for nonemployees (\u201cexpected term\u201d); \n \u2022 the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term; \n \u2022 the expected dividends; \n \u2022 the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term; and \n \u2022 the fair value of Starry's common stock. \nA summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of Starry Options during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n \u2022 Expected volatility - The expected volatility was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers, as we did not have any trading history for Starry's common stock. \n \u2022 Expected term - For employees, the expected term is determined using the \u201csimplified\u201d method, as prescribed by the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to estimate on a formula basis the expected term of the Starry Options which are considered to have \u201cplain vanilla\u201d characteristics. \n \u2022 Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate was based upon quoted market yields for the United States Treasury instruments with terms that were consistent with the expected term of Starry Options and, \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield was based on our history and management's current expectation regarding future dividends.  If factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, share-based compensation cost on future award grants may differ significantly from share-based compensation cost recognized on past award grants. Higher volatility and longer expected terms result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant. Future share-based compensation cost will increase to the extent that we grant additional share-based awards to employees and non-employees. If there are any modifications or cancelations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate any remaining unearned share-based compensation cost or incur incremental cost. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based compensation cost affects our selling, general and administrative expenses and our research and development expenses.\nBased on our estimated fair value of Starry's common stock of $1.81 as of December 31, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of the vested and unvested Starry Options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was $58.5 million.\nBeneficial conversion features associated with convertible notes\nWe issued convertible notes in September 2020, January 2021, and March 2021. Upon assessment of the embedded elements in these agreements, we identified that the automatic conversion feature upon maturity clauses contain a beneficial conversion feature that required separate accounting from the host contract.\nIn order to quantify the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature, we compared the current fair value of the Starry Series D Preferred Stock to the contractual conversion price using the fair value of Starry's common stock as of March 2021 and 2020. We used the input of the estimated fair value of Starry's common stock as the midpoint between the valuations at each date during the period to arrive at the intrinsic value. The beneficial conversion features related to the 2020 Notes, the January 2021 Notes and the March 2021 Notes were $3.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of $1.8 million and $0.2 million in paid-in-kind interest for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, we completed the initial closing of a new equity financing for Starry Series E Preferred Stock (inclusive of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-3 Preferred Stock). As a result of the closing, the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes converted to shares of Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock and Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock, respectively. We concluded the conversion of the 2020 Notes was treated as an accounting conversion in accordance with the original terms of the 2020 Notes and as a result carrying value of the 2020 Notes was reclassified to Starry Series E-1 Preferred Stock. The conversion of the 2021 Notes was treated as an extinguishment of the 2021 Notes which included marking the Starry Series E-2 Preferred Stock to fair value by way of recording a charge to the capital account of $2.8 million representing the additional value provided to the holders of the 2021 Notes upon settlement. We recorded a loss of $2.4 million upon extinguishment of the 2021 Notes.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of spectrum licenses acquired through FCC Auction 102 in June 2019 (the \u201cFCC licenses\u201d). The FCC licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless services. While the FCC licenses are issued for a fixed period of time, ten years for our licenses, the licenses are issued with a regulatory expectation of renewal which are routinely granted and with nominal cost.\nAt acquisition and each assessment period, we consider whether the FCC licenses should be definite or indefinite lived. The FCC licenses are not limited in their useful lives, nor is there an anticipation of another technology to replace the underlying technology. We believe that based on these factors that the FCC licenses are indefinite lived intangibles.\nThe FCC licenses are tested for potential impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), provides the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. ASC 350 permits us to elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment consists of comparing the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date. As of October 1, 2021, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment due to the passage of time and used a market-based approach that did not result in impairment. As of October 1, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment that did not identify any indicators of impairment that would require a quantitative assessment to be performed.\nCapitalization of internal labor costs\nOur business is capital intensive and a large portion of our working capital is spent on activities associated with expanding our distribution system. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying amount of our distribution systems was $92.0 million and $67.3 million, respectively, representing approximately 42% and 41%, respectively, of our total assets.\nCosts associated with distribution system construction and customer installations are capitalized as part of the asset cost. Such capitalized costs include materials, use tax, freight-in, third party labor, internal labor and the associated fringe benefits incurred to bring the distribution system to its intended use. We capitalize such internal labor costs by estimating the amount of time spent on such activities by employees who are responsible for our distribution system construction and customer installations. We capitalized internal labor costs of $17.8 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our activities could affect management's judgment about how we calculate and capitalize internal labor in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and perform updates to such policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances, such as the development of new products and services which may impact the utilization of our employees who construct our distribution system and perform customer installations.\nAsset retirement obligation (\u201cARO\u201d)\nWe lease space on vertical assets (\u201cVA\u201d) on which we install our Starry Titan base stations, and we enter into agreements with multiple dwelling unit (\u201cMDU\u201d) managers or owners to install our Starry Trident transceivers to provide service to the building. These agreements can include language regarding our responsibility to remove equipment and repair the asset to which the Starry equipment was attached (either a VA or a MDU) upon termination of the agreement. The agreements create an obligation associated with the future retirement of the equipment after normal operation of the equipment for the duration of the equipment's life.\nAsset retirement obligations are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be established. Once the fair value of future cash flows has been discounted to present value, the liability is recorded with an offsetting increase to an ARO long-lived asset that is recorded within property and equipment. Subsequent changes to the assets and liabilities are recognized in the period they occur.\nAs the estimated life of the ARO lapses, we recognize depreciation expense for the ARO asset and accretion expense for the ARO liability.\nIf factors change, and we utilize different assumptions, ARO on future MDU and VA equipment installations may differ significantly from ARO on past MDU and VA equipment installations. Higher credit adjusted risk free rates and inflation rates result in an increase to ARO determined at the date of installation. The assumptions and inputs from management, based on information known to us as of each reporting period include:\n \u2022 the rate of inflation \n \u2022 the adjusted risk-free rate \n \u2022 the life of the lease \n \u2022 anticipated costs to of removal \n \u2022 anticipated costs of restoration \nIn future periods, we expect amortization of our long-lived assets associated with the ARO as well as accretion of the ARO to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized amortization and accretion expense, as well as to the AROs associated with future equipment deployments.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSee \u201cNote 2-Summary of significant accounting policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements issued, not yet adopted\u201d in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption and our assessment, to the extent we made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act allows emerging growth companies to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under Section 107, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Any decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We have elected to use the extended transition period available under the JOBS Act.", "item_7_tables": "Table 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

that provides broadband internet service using its proprietary fixed wireless technology. It has launched services in several U.S. cities.\n\n- In 2021, Starry had a net loss of $166.5 million compared to $125.1 million in 2020. The increased loss was primarily due to expansion of its network and operations.\n\n- Revenue grew 73.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by network expansion and increased customer penetration. Cost of revenues grew 51.5% due to network expansion. \n\n- In March 2022, Starry completed a business combination that provided over $150 million in gross proceeds to fund continued growth.\n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates relate to share-based compensation, beneficial conversion features, capitalization of internal labor costs, and asset retirement obligations. These involve significant judgment and could materially impact financial results.\n\n- Liquidity and capital resources are focused on funding growth, network expansion and operating losses. Starry has historically relied on debt and equity financing. Access to capital is critical to continue expansion plans.\n\nIn summary, the report provides an overview of Starry's business, financial performance, accounting policies, liquidity position and plans for growth as an early-stage broadband services provider. The company is investing significantly to expand but requires ongoing access to capital to fund growth and losses."}
