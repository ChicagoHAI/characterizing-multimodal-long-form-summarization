The information provided should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d, Risks Related to COVID-19\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nSummary\nGeron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, an innovative therapeutic for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron's vision is to be recognized as a leader in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Geron is committed to improving and extending the lives of patients by changing the course of these diseases by targeting telomerase. We are currently focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, a first in class telomerase inhibitor, and are conducting two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to enable registration: (i) IMerge Phase 3 in Low or Intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or lower risk MDS, and (ii) IMpactMF in Intermediate-2 or High-risk myelofibrosis, or refractory MF.\nLike many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, the pace of site opening and patient screening and enrollment was in line with our expectations. However, in the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to rapidly affect clinical trial sites around the world. Many of our clinical sites established self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment during this period out of concern for patient exposure to COVID-19 and due to lack of available staff. As a result, we experienced significant delays in site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, in IMerge Phase 3. During the summer of 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases declined due to public health safety measures, some clinical sites removed their self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment, which improved the momentum of patient enrollment. However, beginning in November 2020, another steep rise in COVID-19 cases in most of the countries where IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted again negatively impacted the pace of enrollment. The emergence of COVID-19 variants also began, causing further unpredictability and uncertainty about the pace at which patients and healthcare workers would be able to return to clinical sites.\nSince vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, and we have begun to see the number of COVID-19 cases declining, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. If full enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 completes after the third quarter of 2021, top-line results will not be available by the end of 2022.\nFor IMpactMF, COVID-19 has also negatively impacted clinical trial activities. In addition, in 2020 a number of competing trials were initiated in MF and other oncology indications in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. All plans and timing expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below.\nWe believe that data from two prior Phase 2 clinical trials provide strong evidence that imetelstat targets telomerase to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells in hematologic myeloid malignancies, potentially resulting in meaningful clinical benefits for patients. Data reported from our Phase 2 clinical\ntrial in lower risk MDS provide evidence that imetelstat may achieve meaningful and durable transfusion independence and increase in hemoglobin levels, suggesting potential recovery of normal blood cells. Similarly, data reported from our Phase 2 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, or MF, suggest imetelstat potentially improves overall survival, or OS, for MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor, or relapsed/refractory MF. Additionally, from these Phase 2 clinical trials, we have observed depletion of cytogenetic abnormalities and reductions in key driver mutations of the underlying diseases in both lower risk MDS and MF patients, as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis in MF patients, all of which we believe provides evidence of disease-modifying activity. Furthermore, these molecular and histology data have been correlated with the clinical benefits of transfusion independence in lower risk MDS and improved OS in relapsed/refractory MF. We believe the clinical benefits, molecular observations and correlations from these two Phase 2 trials highlight the magnitude of imetelstat's unique mechanism of action of telomerase inhibition, and provide strong evidence that imetelstat may alter the course of MDS and MF. We believe this disease-modifying activity has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nImetelstat has been granted Fast Track designations by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to lower risk MDS, who do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, also known as non-del(5q), and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, and for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MF. Imetelstat has also been granted orphan drug designations by the FDA in the United States and by the European Commission for the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of MDS and also for the treatment of MF.\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the United States, and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the United States could occur in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat independently in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in significant economic disruption, and has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business. As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty exists concerning the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are actively monitoring the situation and have taken and intend to take those actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our patients, investigators, employees and stockholders. For example, we have restricted access to our offices in California and New Jersey to essential activities for the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with local shelter-in place\u201d orders and suspended non-essential travel worldwide. Our employees have been able to work remotely without significant disruption to our business.\nAs discussed above, like many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations and patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor each clinical site through our contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as to conduct direct outreach to investigators and study staff. Due to the recent decline in COVID-19 cases and the commencement of vaccine distribution, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the\ntiming of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nFor IMpactMF, in addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, in 2020 a number of competing trials in MF and other oncology indications were initiated in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected.\nThe fluidity and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any firm estimates as to the ultimate effect COVID-19 will have on our clinical trials, our operations and our business, all of which are highly reliant on the continued worldwide progress toward managing this health crisis. All plans and timing expectations will be delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities.\nIn alignment with recent guidance from the FDA on clinical trials, FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards,\u201d together with other national and regional guidelines outside the United States, we have taken steps designed to address unavoidable protocol deviations caused by COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures. In addition, we issued an Urgent Safety Measure together with a Dear Investigator Letter to all of our clinical sites involved with IMerge Phase 3 to apply certain measures to protect patient safety that include enhanced ongoing monitoring for signs and symptoms of or exposure to COVID-19 as well as guidance for withholding treatment to patients who have tested positive, who show signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19, or who have potential exposure to COVID-19. Similar guidance has been provided in our clinical trial protocol for IMpactMF.\nImetelstat - A Unique Drug Candidate Directed at a Novel Target Designed to Result in Disease-Modifying Activity\nTelomerase is an enzyme that is upregulated in many malignant stem and progenitor cells and allows them to proliferate without limitation, thereby driving tumor growth and progression. Imetelstat, our proprietary telomerase inhibitor, was designed to directly inhibit telomerase in malignant cells with continuously upregulated telomerase. We have global rights to imetelstat, which was discovered and first developed at Geron.\nData from our Phase 2 imetelstat clinical trials in lower risk MDS and relapsed/refractory MF showed dose- and exposure-dependent reductions of previously known pharmacodynamic markers, or biomarkers, of telomerase inhibition, such as telomerase activity, telomere length and expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, thereby indicating the on-target mechanism of action of imetelstat. Furthermore, these reductions in telomerase biomarkers correlated to better clinical outcomes for patients with higher telomerase activity, higher hTERT level and shorter telomere length. These biomarker data and the evidence of reductions in key driver mutations for MDS and MF, as well as cytogenetically abnormal clones, have been correlated to the clinical benefits observed in our Phase 2 clinical trials. In addition, these molecular data indicate by targeting telomerase, imetelstat inhibits the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells resulting in apoptosis of malignant cells. We believe that the totality of these data provide strong evidence of disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment, which we believe has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nCompelling and Differentiating Phase 2 Data Support Phase 3 Development\nIn lower risk MDS, we reported more mature data from 38 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the IMerge clinical trial, or IMerge Phase 2, in June 2020. As reported previously, 42% (16/38) of patients achieved the primary endpoint of 8-week transfusion independence, and 75% (12/16) of these patients showed a hemoglobin rise of at least 3 grams per deciliter during the transfusion free interval when compared to pretreatment level. An important observation from the more mature data set was the longer durability of transfusion independence, including 29% (11/38) of patients being transfusion-free for more than one year, and a median duration of transfusion independence of 20 months. Such durability provides significant and meaningful clinical benefit to lower risk MDS patients, given their chronic anemia and the debilitating impact of serial blood transfusions, and further supports the disease-modifying potential of imetelstat treatment. Additional information about this more mature data is described in this annual report on Form\n10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, More Mature Data from IMerge Phase 2 Continue to Differentiate Imetelstat in Lower Risk MDS\u201d, including safety data, which remained consistent with safety data from prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies.\nIn relapsed/refractory MF, we previously reported efficacy and safety data from the IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial, including median OS of 28.1 months for patients on the high dose arm of the study, which is almost twice the reported median OS of 13 - 16 months in medical literature. In IMbark, patients also experienced other clinical benefits, including symptom improvement, spleen reduction and bone marrow fibrosis improvement. We reported recent correlation analyses from IMbark in June 2020 that showed a trend of longer OS in patients who achieved symptom response, spleen volume reductions and improved bone marrow fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Given the shortened survival for refractory MF patients, extended median OS would provide substantial clinical benefit. Additional information about the correlation analyses is described in this annual report on Form 10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, Recently Reported Analyses of IMbark Phase 2 Data Provide Evidence of Improvement in OS and Disease-Modifying Potential of Imetelstat.\u201d\nOngoing Phase 3 Development\nIMerge Phase 3 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that, based on discussions with U.S. and European regulatory authorities, we believe may support, if successful, the registration of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 170 patients with lower risk transfusion dependent MDS relapsed/refractory to ESA, who have not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent, or HMA, or lenalidomide and are non-del(5q). IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted at over 100 medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. In December 2020, we achieved 50% of the planned patient enrollment, and in March 2021, we attained 65% of the planned patient enrollment. Taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances of COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available in the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nIMpactMF is designed to be an open label 2:1 randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate imetelstat versus best available therapy, or BAT, in approximately 320 patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF who are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor, or refractory MF. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe the current design of IMpactMF may support, if the trial is successful, the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Currently, we expect to engage over 180 sites to participate in IMpactMF across North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In December 2020, we opened the first three trial sites to patient enrollment.\nGiven the challenges caused by COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. At the interim analysis, if the pre-specified statistical OS criterion is met, we expect such data may support the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Subject to protocol-specified stopping rules for futility, if the pre-specified OS criterion is not met at the interim analysis, the trial will continue to the final analysis, which is expected to occur approximately one year after the interim analysis.\nPlan for Potential Commercialization of Imetelstat\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of an NDA for imetelstat in the United States, and an MAA in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS could occur in the United States in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the EMA could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat ourselves in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. Given these plans, we have developed a potential commercial launch plan, which includes potential financing plans\nthat are driven by the achievement of certain clinical milestones, such as top-line results. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nPotential Patent Term Extensions and Market Exclusivity\nWe have issued U.S. and European patents pertaining to treatment of MF and MDS with imetelstat that extend patent coverage into 2033.\nWe also hold issued patents covering imetelstat composition of matter. In the United States, our composition of matter patent coverage extends through 2025. In Europe, our composition of matter patent coverage expires in 2024, and includes patent rights in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other member countries of the European Patent Convention. Potential patent term extensions may be available to extend our imetelstat composition of matter patent terms in the United States up to 2030 through provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (as amended), or the Hatch-Waxman Act, and in Europe up to 2029 under a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, permitted under European Council (EC) Regulation No. 469/2009, or the European SPC Regulation. In the United States and in Europe, the scope of protection under such a patent term extension, if any were granted, would be defined by the description of the imetelstat product as approved for marketing. An additional six-month extension of the protection under any SPC granted may be available in Europe pursuant to European Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (Pediatric Regulation), or the European Pediatric Regulation. However, such pediatric extension of SPC protection is not available if a one-year extension of marketing exclusivity has already been granted in respect of a new pediatric indication.\nUpon drug product approval, there are additional extensions of regulatory exclusivity which we may receive. We have orphan drug designations for both MDS and MF in the United States and in Europe. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for seven years following drug product approval for the orphan disease indication. In Europe, under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for ten years following drug product approval for each of the orphan disease indications, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for two years pursuant to the European Pediatric Regulation. If we are unable to maintain orphan drug designation, upon drug product approval:\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In the United States, we may have five years of new chemical entity, or NCE exclusivity, which includes data and market exclusivity, under the Hatch-Waxman Act; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In European countries, we may have eight years of data exclusivity plus two years of market exclusivity through provisions of the European Union Data exclusivity Directive 2004/27/EC, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for one year for a new pediatric indication being authorized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, a six month pediatric extension may be available in the United States pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, to the longest extension or exclusivity period available under a patent term extension, the NCE exclusivity period or the orphan drug exclusivity period.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, interest income on our marketable securities and payments we received under our collaborative and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $260.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and current and noncurrent marketable securities, and long-term debt principal balance of $25.0 million.\nOn September 30, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, for an aggregate principal amount up to $75.0 million that can be drawn in three tranches as follows: (i) Tranche A loan of up to $35.0 million of which $25.0 million was funded on the Closing Date and the remaining $10.0 million is available to be drawn until June 15, 2021, (ii) Tranche B loan of up to $15.0 million which is available to be drawn from January 1, 2021 to December 15, 2021, subject to achievement of certain clinical milestones, and (iii) Tranche C loan of up to $25.0 million available to be drawn through December 31, 2022, subject to approval by an investment committee comprised of Hercules and SVB.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $25.0 million under Tranche A has been drawn, and there have been no other amounts drawn under the other Tranches.\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities, Inc., or B. Riley Securities, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement that we entered on May 18, 2018, or the 2018 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley FBR. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement.\nOn May 27, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, or the stock purchase warrants. The combined public offering price of the common stock and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.30 per share. The combined public offering price of the pre-funded warrant and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.299 per share. The net cash proceeds from this offering were approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses paid by us, and excludes any future proceeds from the exercise of the pre-funded warrant or the stock purchase warrants.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaboration agreements, and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. We currently have no source of product revenue. While we reported a small profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, until 2015 we had never been profitable, and have not reported any profit since. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception in 1990, resulting principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.2 billion.\nThe significance of future losses, future revenues and any potential future profitability will depend primarily on the clinical and commercial success of imetelstat, our sole product candidate. In any event, imetelstat will require significant additional clinical testing prior to possible regulatory approval in the United States and other countries. We expect research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and losses to substantially increase in future periods as we continue to support the imetelstat development program through late-stage development, including the conduct and completion of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF. To further advance the imetelstat program, including conducting the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to obtain regulatory approval for imetelstat and establishing sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize imetelstat in the United States on our own, if regulatory approval is granted, substantial additional capital will be required. If approved for marketing by regulatory authorities outside of the United States, we may seek potential commercialization partners for such territories. We do not expect imetelstat to be commercially available for many years, if at all.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.\nA critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (i) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and\n(ii) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes historically have been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our financial statements are stated fairly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe categorize financial instruments recorded at fair value on our balance sheets based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2-Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.\nLevel 3-Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on our balance sheets, including the category for such financial instruments.\nFinancial instruments classified as Level 1 include money market funds and certificates of deposit, representing approximately 2% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. Financial instruments classified as Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and equity investments, representing approximately 98% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. The price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources. Periodically, we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes as well as reviewing the pricing methodologies used by our portfolio managers. Historically, we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio managers' prices.\nFor a further discussion regarding fair value measurements, see Note 2 on Fair Value Measurements in Notes to Financial Statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. Financial results for the reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, Leases, or Topic 840.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Operating leases are included in operating leases, right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities on our balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the expected lease term. The present value of remaining lease payments within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current lease liabilities. The present value of lease payments not within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent lease liabilities. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts to calculate the present value is typically not readily determinable. As such, significant management judgment is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment as of the lease commencement date. We evaluate the assumptions used in estimating the incremental borrowing rate by reviewing industry and regional data for operating leases and loans with similar terms. We have not made any revisions to borrowing rate estimates. If the basis for the incremental borrowing rate estimate were to change, then the present value of remaining lease payments could differ significantly which would affect the value recognized for the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our balance sheets. See Note 7 on Operating Leases in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations.\nOn March 10, 2020, a new operating lease commitment for our offices in Foster City, California commenced upon the substantial completion of all tenant improvements. As of the lease commencement date, the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability was approximately $3.4 million, which represented the present value of remaining lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate of 7% over the initial lease term of 87 months, net of a three-month rent abatement period. Under the Foster City Lease, we are also obligated to pay certain variable expenses separately from the base rent, including taxes and common area maintenance. Such costs are considered non-lease components and have been excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability and are being expensed in the period they are incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nBeginning January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. In determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue to be recognized under Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with our customer; (ii) identify the promised goods or services in the agreement and determine whether they are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the agreement; (iii) measure the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on stand-alone selling prices; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. Significant management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required and the period over which completion of the performance obligations is expected under an agreement. If reasonable estimates regarding when performance obligations are either complete or substantially complete cannot be made, then revenue recognition is deferred until a reasonable estimate can be made. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimated selling prices for license rights are calculated using an income approach model and include the following key assumptions, judgments and estimates: the development timeline, revenue forecast, commercialization expenses, discount rate and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nOur revenues historically have consisted of collaboration revenue, license fees and royalties. Collaboration revenue primarily represented amounts earned under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen for the imetelstat program. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. License fees and royalty revenue primarily represents amounts earned under agreements that out-license our technology to various oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production companies. Economic terms in these agreements may include non-refundable upfront license payments in cash or equity securities, annual license maintenance fees, cost sharing arrangements, milestone payments, royalties on future sales of products, or any combination of these items. Non-refundable upfront fees, annual license maintenance fees and funding of research and\ndevelopment activities are considered fixed consideration, while milestone payments and royalties are identified as variable consideration.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property. If we determine the license to intellectual property is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the agreement and the licensee can use and benefit from the license, we recognize revenue from non-refundable upfront fees allocated to the license upon the completion of the transfer of the license to the licensee. For such licenses, we recognize revenue from annual license maintenance fees upon the start of the new license period. For licenses that are bundled with other performance obligations, we assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable upfront fees or annual license maintenance fees. At each reporting period, we reassess the progress and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is included in the transaction price. For milestones that we do not deem to be probable of being achieved, the associated milestone payments are fully constrained and the value of the milestone is excluded from the transaction price with no revenue being recognized. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory-related accomplishments, are not considered probable of being achieved until those accomplishments have been communicated by the relevant regulatory authority. Once the assessment of probability of achievement becomes probable, we recognize revenue for the milestone payment. At each reporting date, we assess the probability of achievement of each milestone under our current agreements.\nRoyalties. For agreements with sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, where the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of: (a) when the related sales occur, or (b) when the performance obligation, to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated, has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). At each reporting date, we estimate the sales incurred by each licensee during the reporting period based on historical experience and accrue the associated royalty amount.\nCost Sharing Arrangements. Research and development and other expenses being shared by both parties under an agreement are recorded as earned or owed based on the performance obligations by both parties under the respective agreement. For arrangements in which we and our collaboration partner in the agreement are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize payments between the parties on a net basis and record such amounts as a reduction or addition to research and development expense. For arrangements in which we have agreed to perform certain research and development services for our collaboration partner and are not exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize the respective cost reimbursements as revenue under the collaboration agreement over time in a manner proportionate to the costs we incurred to perform the services using the input method.\nRevenue recognition for licenses and collaboration agreements requires significant judgment. Our assessments and estimates are based on contractual terms, historical experience and general industry practice. Revisions in these values or estimations have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee or collaboration revenue in the period of revision. As of December 31, 2020, we have not made any revisions to revenue recognition estimates.\nClinical Trial Accruals\nOur current imetelstat clinical trials are being supported by third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors. We accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial. For clinical trial expenses and related expenses associated with the conduct of clinical trials, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, the number of active clinical sites, and the duration for which the patients have been enrolled in the trial. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, review of contractual terms and correspondence with CROs. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In that event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain. For the clinical development activities previously conducted by Janssen under the former Collaboration Agreement, we monitored patient enrollment levels and related\nactivities to the extent possible through discussions with Janssen personnel and based our estimates of clinical trial costs on the best information available at the time.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to our employees and directors, including service-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, based on estimated grant-date fair values for these instruments. The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight-line method and reduced for estimated forfeitures. For performance-based stock options with vesting conditioned on the achievement of certain strategic milestones, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met and is reduced for estimated forfeitures, as applicable. If the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved, no stock-based compensation expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met, if at all. If that assessment of the probability of the performance condition being met changes, the impact of the change in estimate would be recognized in the period of the change. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of our service-based and performance-based stock options and employee stock purchases. The grant-date fair value for service-based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nOption-pricing model assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on our common stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In deriving this assumption, we review actual historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled. For performance-based stock options, we also assess the projected timing of potential achievement of the milestones. The expected term of employees' purchase rights under our ESPP is equal to the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Zero Coupon Treasury Strip Yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data and are adjusted, if necessary, over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from their estimate.\nWe evaluate the assumptions used in estimating grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data on an annual basis. We have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods, the stock-based compensation expense that we record for share-based payment awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period. Thus, historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results. For example, in 2015 we reported net income for the first time due to recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. In addition, we expect to incur increasing operating losses in the future as we support our current Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF.\nWe are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development, including, but not limited to, risks inherent in research and development efforts, including the development, manufacture, regulatory approval for and commercialization of, imetelstat; uncertainty of non-clinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances; the future development of imetelstat by us, including any future efficacy or safety results that may cause the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat to become unacceptable; overcoming disruptions and/or delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic; our need for future capital; enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights; reliance upon our consultants, licensees, investigators and other third parties; and potential competition. In order for imetelstat to be\ncommercialized, we must conduct non-clinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of imetelstat, obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing, distribution and marketing arrangements, as well as obtain market acceptance. We do not expect to receive revenue based on sales of imetelstat for many years, if at all.\nRevenues\nWe previously entered into license or collaboration agreements with companies involved with oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production, whereby we granted certain rights to our non-imetelstat related technologies. As of December 31, 2020, our license agreements related to our human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, technology have been terminated or expired due to patent expirations on such technology. The remaining active license agreement was a license related to our specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry, as well as patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, the building blocks of oligonucleotides. This license recently has been terminated effective April 2021. In connection with these agreements, we were eligible to receive license fees, option fees, milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products, or any combination thereof. Also, in connection with the divestiture of Geron's human embryonic stem cell assets, including intellectual property and proprietary technology, to Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly BioTime, Inc. which acquired Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc.) in 2013, we are entitled to receive royalties on sales from certain research or commercial products utilizing Geron's former intellectual property.\nWe recognized license fee revenues of $55,000, $96,000 and $641,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to our various agreements. The decrease in license fee revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects a reduction in the number of active license agreements for research licenses related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology.\nWe recognized royalty revenues of $198,000, $364,000 and $425,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research-use-only market and cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs. The decrease in royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects expiration of licenses which eliminated the obligation to pay royalties on product sales. Royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect estimated royalties from sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell assets.\nFuture license fee and royalty revenues are dependent on additional agreements being signed, if any, our current license agreement being maintained and the underlying patent rights for the license remaining active. Historical revenues may not be predictive of future revenues. We expect revenues in 2021 to be lower than 2020 due to the termination and expiration of our license agreements related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology. In addition, due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs are expected to be lower which reduces the royalties payable to us.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, imetelstat was the sole research and development program we supported. For the imetelstat research and development program, we incur direct external, personnel related and other research and development costs. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, direct external expenses included costs for our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors and 100% of the clinical development costs incurred by Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period. For the year ended December 31, 2018, direct external expenses primarily consisted of our proportionate share of research and development costs incurred by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Personnel related expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes and benefits for Geron employees involved with ongoing research and development efforts. Other research and development expenses primarily consist of research-related overhead associated with allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other supplies.\nResearch and development expenses were $51.5 million, $52.1 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2020 primarily reflects the net result of lower direct external expenses due to the completion of the imetelstat program transition, the closing of IMbark and reduced purchases of raw materials, drug substance and drug product, partially offset by higher expenses for IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF. The increase in research and\ndevelopment expenses in 2019 primarily reflects higher direct external costs for clinical development activities. Such costs included: a) fees to our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors for imetelstat program transition; b) start-up expenses for IMerge Phase 3; c) 100% reimbursement to Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period and d) purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen. In addition, personnel related expenses have increased in 2020 and 2019 as a result of additional development headcount being hired.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct external research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical program: Imetelstat\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen was required to provide operational support for the imetelstat program through September 2019 during transition of the program to us, including continuing to support ongoing imetelstat clinical trials. We reimbursed Janssen for 100% of the costs for such operational support. However, costs associated with transition activities, such as transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials, moving databases and related systems and transmitting regulatory files, were incurred separately by each company, unless otherwise specified in the Collaboration Agreement. As of the end of September 2019, the transition of the imetelstat program to us from Janssen was completed according to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we support the current two Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF. At this time, we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to advance imetelstat toward commercialization. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of imetelstat, see the sub-sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $25.7 million, $20.9 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher personnel-related costs for additional headcount to support growing operational activities associated with bi-coastal offices, increased company headcount and international clinical trial activities, as well as increased legal costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as the imetelstat program matures and potential pre-commercialization preparatory activities begin.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $1.8 million, $4.2 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects lower yields on our marketable securities portfolio due to declining interest rates despite an increase in the size of our marketable securities portfolio. The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects higher yields on a larger marketable securities portfolio. Interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our marketable securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $760,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflects interest payments under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB. The Loan Agreement was effective September 30, 2020. As such, no comparable interest expense amounts were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nChange in Fair Value of Equity Investment\nWe remeasure the fair value of our equity investment at each reporting date and any resulting change in fair value based on observable price changes is included on our statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was an increase in fair value of our equity investment of $60,000 and a decrease in fair value of our equity investment of $195,000 and $541,000, respectively, resulting from observable price changes in the equity investment. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of the underlying equity investment and is therefore subject to volatility that could adversely affect our operating results.\nGain on Settlement\nIn July 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen, Inc., or ViaGen, filed an arbitration claim against Trans Ova Genetics, L.C., or Trans Ova, for alleged violations under a Share Purchase Agreement, or SPA, including failure to make payments under certain conditions. In December 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen agreed to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of $3.7 million, of which we received $1.5 million, which represents our 40% share of the settlement amount. With this settlement, Trans Ova has been released from any further obligations under the SPA, including any future payments. No comparable amounts were recognized in 2020 or 2019.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense was $168,000, $69,000 and $114,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized other income of $182,000 for the share exchange of our equity investment in Sienna Cancer Diagnostics, Limited upon its acquisition by BARD1 Life Sciences Limited, or BARD1. Also included in other income were realized losses of $34,000 for the sales of BARD1 shares during the third quarter of 2020. See Note 2 on Fair Value Measurement - Equity Investment in Notes to Financial Statements for further information.\nOther expense primarily reflects changes in the fair value of our equity investment resulting from foreign currency translation and bank charges related to our cash operating accounts and marketable securities portfolio. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar and is therefore subject to volatility, especially in light of the unpredictable market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our future operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $260.0 million, compared to $159.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and current and noncurrent marketable securities from December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of the receipt of net cash proceeds of approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by us, from an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying stock purchase warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, that we completed on May 27, 2020. In September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million, after deducting debt discounts and other debt issuance costs payable by us.\nWe have an investment policy to invest our cash in liquid, investment grade securities, such as interest-bearing money market funds, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, U.S. government and agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and commercial paper. Our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub-prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities or auction rate securities and, to date, we have not recognized any other-than-temporary impairment charges on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity. To date, we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents; however, access to our invested cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nIn May 2018, we entered into the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley FBR as our sales agent. Pursuant to the\n2018 Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR sold our common stock at market prices prevailing at the time of sale for which B. Riley FBR received an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds. From January 2020 through April 2020, we sold an aggregate of 3,496,616 shares of our common stock under the 2018 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million after deducting sales commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The 2018 Sales Agreement has been superseded by the 2020 Sales Agreement (see below).\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the 2018 Sales Agreement. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement. No shares were sold in 2020 under the 2020 Sales Agreement. See Note 9 on Stockholders' Equity in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2020 Sales Agreement. In the first quarter of 2021, we sold an aggregate of 7,948,505 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $16.2 million after deducting sales commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. See Note 12 on Subsequent Events in Notes to Financial Statements for sales under the 2020 Sales Agreement in 2021.\nWe estimate that our existing capital resources and future interest income will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next 12 months and potentially as long as through the end of 2022. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available after the end of 2022, we will require additional capital to reach top-line results. In any event, we will require substantial additional funding to further advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF. In addition, our ability to commercialize imetelstat in the United States, if regulatory approval is granted, depends on us being able to establish sales and marketing capabilities.\nBecause the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. In addition, our plans and timing expectations will be further delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, timing, magnitude and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and potential future clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF and other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delays or disruptions in opening sites, screening and enrolling patients or treating and following patients, in IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, such as obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals for IMpactMF in the United States and in other countries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to achieve any meaningful reduction in manufacturing costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CROs and CMOs, to pursue the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing and manufacturing of imetelstat and potential future commercialization and marketing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our efforts to enhance operational, financial and management processes and systems that will be required for future development and commercialization of imetelstat, and our ability to successfully recruit and retain additional key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries, and the associated costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs and timing necessary to build a sales force in the United States to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the sales price for imetelstat;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses associated with the pending putative securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with potential future litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, telecommunications and administrative oversight, as well as higher expenses for travel when travel becomes possible in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;

Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from imetelstat to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, which may not be possible. Availability of such financing sources may be negatively impacted with any further delays in reporting results from IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF.\nAdditional financing through public or private debt or equity financings, including pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, to the extent available, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may be unable to raise equity capital, or may be forced to do so at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private debt and equity markets to proposed financings has been substantially affected by uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be affected by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased market volatility and could result in a significant long-term disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to raise additional funds through financings, and could negatively impact the terms upon which we may raise those funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Due to uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate, we may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to raise additional funds proactively\nto meet longer-term anticipated operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, we have borrowed, and in the future may borrow, additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund imetelstat development and our future growth, including pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms under agreements, such as the Loan Agreement, that include restrictive covenants, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Moreover, if we raise additional funds through alliance, collaborative or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our common stock, including under the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities or potential future drawdowns, if available, under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. In any event, we will continue to need substantial additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and potential commercialization of imetelstat in lower risk MDS and refractory MF, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development, including completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing, conducting or completing other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or pursuing potential commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and we might cease operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $66.7 million, $43.8 million and $21.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operating activities in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher payments for research and development expenses in connection with supporting the ongoing conduct of IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF, increases in development headcount, the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us and purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 was $105.3 million and $77.7 million , respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $27.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 primarily reflects a higher rate of purchases than maturities of marketable securities resulting from the investment of net cash proceeds from financings completed in 2020 and 2018. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily reflects a higher rate of maturities than purchases of marketable securities.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2020, we purchased approximately $830,000 in property and equipment, none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $168.3 million, $19.5 million and $93.0 million, respectively. Financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect the receipt of $140.2 million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock, pre-funded warrant and stock purchase warrants in May 2020, receipt of net cash proceeds from the sales of our common stock under the 2015 Sales Agreement with MLV and the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR and cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans. In addition, in September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million after deducting the debt discounts and debt issuance costs paid by us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1 and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. The information provided should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d, Risks Related to COVID-19\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nSummary\nGeron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, an innovative therapeutic for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron's vision is to be recognized as a leader in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Geron is committed to improving and extending the lives of patients by changing the course of these diseases by targeting telomerase. We are currently focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, a first in class telomerase inhibitor, and are conducting two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to enable registration: (i) IMerge Phase 3 in Low or Intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or lower risk MDS, and (ii) IMpactMF in Intermediate-2 or High-risk myelofibrosis, or refractory MF.\nLike many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, the pace of site opening and patient screening and enrollment was in line with our expectations. However, in the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to rapidly affect clinical trial sites around the world. Many of our clinical sites established self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment during this period out of concern for patient exposure to COVID-19 and due to lack of available staff. As a result, we experienced significant delays in site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, in IMerge Phase 3. During the summer of 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases declined due to public health safety measures, some clinical sites removed their self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment, which improved the momentum of patient enrollment. However, beginning in November 2020, another steep rise in COVID-19 cases in most of the countries where IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted again negatively impacted the pace of enrollment. The emergence of COVID-19 variants also began, causing further unpredictability and uncertainty about the pace at which patients and healthcare workers would be able to return to clinical sites.\nSince vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, and we have begun to see the number of COVID-19 cases declining, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. If full enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 completes after the third quarter of 2021, top-line results will not be available by the end of 2022.\nFor IMpactMF, COVID-19 has also negatively impacted clinical trial activities. In addition, in 2020 a number of competing trials were initiated in MF and other oncology indications in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. All plans and timing expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below.\nWe believe that data from two prior Phase 2 clinical trials provide strong evidence that imetelstat targets telomerase to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells in hematologic myeloid malignancies, potentially resulting in meaningful clinical benefits for patients. Data reported from our Phase 2 clinical\ntrial in lower risk MDS provide evidence that imetelstat may achieve meaningful and durable transfusion independence and increase in hemoglobin levels, suggesting potential recovery of normal blood cells. Similarly, data reported from our Phase 2 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, or MF, suggest imetelstat potentially improves overall survival, or OS, for MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor, or relapsed/refractory MF. Additionally, from these Phase 2 clinical trials, we have observed depletion of cytogenetic abnormalities and reductions in key driver mutations of the underlying diseases in both lower risk MDS and MF patients, as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis in MF patients, all of which we believe provides evidence of disease-modifying activity. Furthermore, these molecular and histology data have been correlated with the clinical benefits of transfusion independence in lower risk MDS and improved OS in relapsed/refractory MF. We believe the clinical benefits, molecular observations and correlations from these two Phase 2 trials highlight the magnitude of imetelstat's unique mechanism of action of telomerase inhibition, and provide strong evidence that imetelstat may alter the course of MDS and MF. We believe this disease-modifying activity has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nImetelstat has been granted Fast Track designations by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to lower risk MDS, who do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, also known as non-del(5q), and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, and for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MF. Imetelstat has also been granted orphan drug designations by the FDA in the United States and by the European Commission for the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of MDS and also for the treatment of MF.\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the United States, and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the United States could occur in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat independently in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in significant economic disruption, and has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business. As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty exists concerning the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are actively monitoring the situation and have taken and intend to take those actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our patients, investigators, employees and stockholders. For example, we have restricted access to our offices in California and New Jersey to essential activities for the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with local shelter-in place\u201d orders and suspended non-essential travel worldwide. Our employees have been able to work remotely without significant disruption to our business.\nAs discussed above, like many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations and patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor each clinical site through our contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as to conduct direct outreach to investigators and study staff. Due to the recent decline in COVID-19 cases and the commencement of vaccine distribution, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the\ntiming of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nFor IMpactMF, in addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, in 2020 a number of competing trials in MF and other oncology indications were initiated in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected.\nThe fluidity and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any firm estimates as to the ultimate effect COVID-19 will have on our clinical trials, our operations and our business, all of which are highly reliant on the continued worldwide progress toward managing this health crisis. All plans and timing expectations will be delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities.\nIn alignment with recent guidance from the FDA on clinical trials, FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards,\u201d together with other national and regional guidelines outside the United States, we have taken steps designed to address unavoidable protocol deviations caused by COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures. In addition, we issued an Urgent Safety Measure together with a Dear Investigator Letter to all of our clinical sites involved with IMerge Phase 3 to apply certain measures to protect patient safety that include enhanced ongoing monitoring for signs and symptoms of or exposure to COVID-19 as well as guidance for withholding treatment to patients who have tested positive, who show signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19, or who have potential exposure to COVID-19. Similar guidance has been provided in our clinical trial protocol for IMpactMF.\nImetelstat - A Unique Drug Candidate Directed at a Novel Target Designed to Result in Disease-Modifying Activity\nTelomerase is an enzyme that is upregulated in many malignant stem and progenitor cells and allows them to proliferate without limitation, thereby driving tumor growth and progression. Imetelstat, our proprietary telomerase inhibitor, was designed to directly inhibit telomerase in malignant cells with continuously upregulated telomerase. We have global rights to imetelstat, which was discovered and first developed at Geron.\nData from our Phase 2 imetelstat clinical trials in lower risk MDS and relapsed/refractory MF showed dose- and exposure-dependent reductions of previously known pharmacodynamic markers, or biomarkers, of telomerase inhibition, such as telomerase activity, telomere length and expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, thereby indicating the on-target mechanism of action of imetelstat. Furthermore, these reductions in telomerase biomarkers correlated to better clinical outcomes for patients with higher telomerase activity, higher hTERT level and shorter telomere length. These biomarker data and the evidence of reductions in key driver mutations for MDS and MF, as well as cytogenetically abnormal clones, have been correlated to the clinical benefits observed in our Phase 2 clinical trials. In addition, these molecular data indicate by targeting telomerase, imetelstat inhibits the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells resulting in apoptosis of malignant cells. We believe that the totality of these data provide strong evidence of disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment, which we believe has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nCompelling and Differentiating Phase 2 Data Support Phase 3 Development\nIn lower risk MDS, we reported more mature data from 38 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the IMerge clinical trial, or IMerge Phase 2, in June 2020. As reported previously, 42% (16/38) of patients achieved the primary endpoint of 8-week transfusion independence, and 75% (12/16) of these patients showed a hemoglobin rise of at least 3 grams per deciliter during the transfusion free interval when compared to pretreatment level. An important observation from the more mature data set was the longer durability of transfusion independence, including 29% (11/38) of patients being transfusion-free for more than one year, and a median duration of transfusion independence of 20 months. Such durability provides significant and meaningful clinical benefit to lower risk MDS patients, given their chronic anemia and the debilitating impact of serial blood transfusions, and further supports the disease-modifying potential of imetelstat treatment. Additional information about this more mature data is described in this annual report on Form\n10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, More Mature Data from IMerge Phase 2 Continue to Differentiate Imetelstat in Lower Risk MDS\u201d, including safety data, which remained consistent with safety data from prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies.\nIn relapsed/refractory MF, we previously reported efficacy and safety data from the IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial, including median OS of 28.1 months for patients on the high dose arm of the study, which is almost twice the reported median OS of 13 - 16 months in medical literature. In IMbark, patients also experienced other clinical benefits, including symptom improvement, spleen reduction and bone marrow fibrosis improvement. We reported recent correlation analyses from IMbark in June 2020 that showed a trend of longer OS in patients who achieved symptom response, spleen volume reductions and improved bone marrow fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Given the shortened survival for refractory MF patients, extended median OS would provide substantial clinical benefit. Additional information about the correlation analyses is described in this annual report on Form 10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, Recently Reported Analyses of IMbark Phase 2 Data Provide Evidence of Improvement in OS and Disease-Modifying Potential of Imetelstat.\u201d\nOngoing Phase 3 Development\nIMerge Phase 3 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that, based on discussions with U.S. and European regulatory authorities, we believe may support, if successful, the registration of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 170 patients with lower risk transfusion dependent MDS relapsed/refractory to ESA, who have not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent, or HMA, or lenalidomide and are non-del(5q). IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted at over 100 medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. In December 2020, we achieved 50% of the planned patient enrollment, and in March 2021, we attained 65% of the planned patient enrollment. Taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances of COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available in the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nIMpactMF is designed to be an open label 2:1 randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate imetelstat versus best available therapy, or BAT, in approximately 320 patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF who are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor, or refractory MF. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe the current design of IMpactMF may support, if the trial is successful, the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Currently, we expect to engage over 180 sites to participate in IMpactMF across North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In December 2020, we opened the first three trial sites to patient enrollment.\nGiven the challenges caused by COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. At the interim analysis, if the pre-specified statistical OS criterion is met, we expect such data may support the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Subject to protocol-specified stopping rules for futility, if the pre-specified OS criterion is not met at the interim analysis, the trial will continue to the final analysis, which is expected to occur approximately one year after the interim analysis.\nPlan for Potential Commercialization of Imetelstat\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of an NDA for imetelstat in the United States, and an MAA in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS could occur in the United States in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the EMA could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat ourselves in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. Given these plans, we have developed a potential commercial launch plan, which includes potential financing plans\nthat are driven by the achievement of certain clinical milestones, such as top-line results. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nPotential Patent Term Extensions and Market Exclusivity\nWe have issued U.S. and European patents pertaining to treatment of MF and MDS with imetelstat that extend patent coverage into 2033.\nWe also hold issued patents covering imetelstat composition of matter. In the United States, our composition of matter patent coverage extends through 2025. In Europe, our composition of matter patent coverage expires in 2024, and includes patent rights in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other member countries of the European Patent Convention. Potential patent term extensions may be available to extend our imetelstat composition of matter patent terms in the United States up to 2030 through provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (as amended), or the Hatch-Waxman Act, and in Europe up to 2029 under a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, permitted under European Council (EC) Regulation No. 469/2009, or the European SPC Regulation. In the United States and in Europe, the scope of protection under such a patent term extension, if any were granted, would be defined by the description of the imetelstat product as approved for marketing. An additional six-month extension of the protection under any SPC granted may be available in Europe pursuant to European Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (Pediatric Regulation), or the European Pediatric Regulation. However, such pediatric extension of SPC protection is not available if a one-year extension of marketing exclusivity has already been granted in respect of a new pediatric indication.\nUpon drug product approval, there are additional extensions of regulatory exclusivity which we may receive. We have orphan drug designations for both MDS and MF in the United States and in Europe. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for seven years following drug product approval for the orphan disease indication. In Europe, under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for ten years following drug product approval for each of the orphan disease indications, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for two years pursuant to the European Pediatric Regulation. If we are unable to maintain orphan drug designation, upon drug product approval:\n \u2022 In the United States, we may have five years of new chemical entity, or NCE exclusivity, which includes data and market exclusivity, under the Hatch-Waxman Act; and \n \u2022 In European countries, we may have eight years of data exclusivity plus two years of market exclusivity through provisions of the European Union Data exclusivity Directive 2004/27/EC, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for one year for a new pediatric indication being authorized. \nIn addition, a six month pediatric extension may be available in the United States pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, to the longest extension or exclusivity period available under a patent term extension, the NCE exclusivity period or the orphan drug exclusivity period.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, interest income on our marketable securities and payments we received under our collaborative and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $260.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and current and noncurrent marketable securities, and long-term debt principal balance of $25.0 million.\nOn September 30, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, for an aggregate principal amount up to $75.0 million that can be drawn in three tranches as follows: (i) Tranche A loan of up to $35.0 million of which $25.0 million was funded on the Closing Date and the remaining $10.0 million is available to be drawn until June 15, 2021, (ii) Tranche B loan of up to $15.0 million which is available to be drawn from January 1, 2021 to December 15, 2021, subject to achievement of certain clinical milestones, and (iii) Tranche C loan of up to $25.0 million available to be drawn through December 31, 2022, subject to approval by an investment committee comprised of Hercules and SVB.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $25.0 million under Tranche A has been drawn, and there have been no other amounts drawn under the other Tranches.\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities, Inc., or B. Riley Securities, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement that we entered on May 18, 2018, or the 2018 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley FBR. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement.\nOn May 27, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, or the stock purchase warrants. The combined public offering price of the common stock and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.30 per share. The combined public offering price of the pre-funded warrant and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.299 per share. The net cash proceeds from this offering were approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses paid by us, and excludes any future proceeds from the exercise of the pre-funded warrant or the stock purchase warrants.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaboration agreements, and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. We currently have no source of product revenue. While we reported a small profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, until 2015 we had never been profitable, and have not reported any profit since. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception in 1990, resulting principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.2 billion.\nThe significance of future losses, future revenues and any potential future profitability will depend primarily on the clinical and commercial success of imetelstat, our sole product candidate. In any event, imetelstat will require significant additional clinical testing prior to possible regulatory approval in the United States and other countries. We expect research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and losses to substantially increase in future periods as we continue to support the imetelstat development program through late-stage development, including the conduct and completion of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF. To further advance the imetelstat program, including conducting the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to obtain regulatory approval for imetelstat and establishing sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize imetelstat in the United States on our own, if regulatory approval is granted, substantial additional capital will be required. If approved for marketing by regulatory authorities outside of the United States, we may seek potential commercialization partners for such territories. We do not expect imetelstat to be commercially available for many years, if at all.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.\nA critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (i) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and\n(ii) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes historically have been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our financial statements are stated fairly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe categorize financial instruments recorded at fair value on our balance sheets based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2-Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.\nLevel 3-Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on our balance sheets, including the category for such financial instruments.\nFinancial instruments classified as Level 1 include money market funds and certificates of deposit, representing approximately 2% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. Financial instruments classified as Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and equity investments, representing approximately 98% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. The price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources. Periodically, we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes as well as reviewing the pricing methodologies used by our portfolio managers. Historically, we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio managers' prices.\nFor a further discussion regarding fair value measurements, see Note 2 on Fair Value Measurements in Notes to Financial Statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. Financial results for the reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, Leases, or Topic 840.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Operating leases are included in operating leases, right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities on our balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the expected lease term. The present value of remaining lease payments within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current lease liabilities. The present value of lease payments not within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent lease liabilities. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts to calculate the present value is typically not readily determinable. As such, significant management judgment is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment as of the lease commencement date. We evaluate the assumptions used in estimating the incremental borrowing rate by reviewing industry and regional data for operating leases and loans with similar terms. We have not made any revisions to borrowing rate estimates. If the basis for the incremental borrowing rate estimate were to change, then the present value of remaining lease payments could differ significantly which would affect the value recognized for the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our balance sheets. See Note 7 on Operating Leases in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations.\nOn March 10, 2020, a new operating lease commitment for our offices in Foster City, California commenced upon the substantial completion of all tenant improvements. As of the lease commencement date, the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability was approximately $3.4 million, which represented the present value of remaining lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate of 7% over the initial lease term of 87 months, net of a three-month rent abatement period. Under the Foster City Lease, we are also obligated to pay certain variable expenses separately from the base rent, including taxes and common area maintenance. Such costs are considered non-lease components and have been excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability and are being expensed in the period they are incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nBeginning January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. In determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue to be recognized under Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with our customer; (ii) identify the promised goods or services in the agreement and determine whether they are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the agreement; (iii) measure the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on stand-alone selling prices; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. Significant management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required and the period over which completion of the performance obligations is expected under an agreement. If reasonable estimates regarding when performance obligations are either complete or substantially complete cannot be made, then revenue recognition is deferred until a reasonable estimate can be made. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimated selling prices for license rights are calculated using an income approach model and include the following key assumptions, judgments and estimates: the development timeline, revenue forecast, commercialization expenses, discount rate and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nOur revenues historically have consisted of collaboration revenue, license fees and royalties. Collaboration revenue primarily represented amounts earned under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen for the imetelstat program. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. License fees and royalty revenue primarily represents amounts earned under agreements that out-license our technology to various oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production companies. Economic terms in these agreements may include non-refundable upfront license payments in cash or equity securities, annual license maintenance fees, cost sharing arrangements, milestone payments, royalties on future sales of products, or any combination of these items. Non-refundable upfront fees, annual license maintenance fees and funding of research and\ndevelopment activities are considered fixed consideration, while milestone payments and royalties are identified as variable consideration.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property. If we determine the license to intellectual property is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the agreement and the licensee can use and benefit from the license, we recognize revenue from non-refundable upfront fees allocated to the license upon the completion of the transfer of the license to the licensee. For such licenses, we recognize revenue from annual license maintenance fees upon the start of the new license period. For licenses that are bundled with other performance obligations, we assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable upfront fees or annual license maintenance fees. At each reporting period, we reassess the progress and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is included in the transaction price. For milestones that we do not deem to be probable of being achieved, the associated milestone payments are fully constrained and the value of the milestone is excluded from the transaction price with no revenue being recognized. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory-related accomplishments, are not considered probable of being achieved until those accomplishments have been communicated by the relevant regulatory authority. Once the assessment of probability of achievement becomes probable, we recognize revenue for the milestone payment. At each reporting date, we assess the probability of achievement of each milestone under our current agreements.\nRoyalties. For agreements with sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, where the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of: (a) when the related sales occur, or (b) when the performance obligation, to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated, has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). At each reporting date, we estimate the sales incurred by each licensee during the reporting period based on historical experience and accrue the associated royalty amount.\nCost Sharing Arrangements. Research and development and other expenses being shared by both parties under an agreement are recorded as earned or owed based on the performance obligations by both parties under the respective agreement. For arrangements in which we and our collaboration partner in the agreement are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize payments between the parties on a net basis and record such amounts as a reduction or addition to research and development expense. For arrangements in which we have agreed to perform certain research and development services for our collaboration partner and are not exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize the respective cost reimbursements as revenue under the collaboration agreement over time in a manner proportionate to the costs we incurred to perform the services using the input method.\nRevenue recognition for licenses and collaboration agreements requires significant judgment. Our assessments and estimates are based on contractual terms, historical experience and general industry practice. Revisions in these values or estimations have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee or collaboration revenue in the period of revision. As of December 31, 2020, we have not made any revisions to revenue recognition estimates.\nClinical Trial Accruals\nOur current imetelstat clinical trials are being supported by third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors. We accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial. For clinical trial expenses and related expenses associated with the conduct of clinical trials, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, the number of active clinical sites, and the duration for which the patients have been enrolled in the trial. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, review of contractual terms and correspondence with CROs. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In that event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain. For the clinical development activities previously conducted by Janssen under the former Collaboration Agreement, we monitored patient enrollment levels and related\nactivities to the extent possible through discussions with Janssen personnel and based our estimates of clinical trial costs on the best information available at the time.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to our employees and directors, including service-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, based on estimated grant-date fair values for these instruments. The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight-line method and reduced for estimated forfeitures. For performance-based stock options with vesting conditioned on the achievement of certain strategic milestones, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met and is reduced for estimated forfeitures, as applicable. If the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved, no stock-based compensation expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met, if at all. If that assessment of the probability of the performance condition being met changes, the impact of the change in estimate would be recognized in the period of the change. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of our service-based and performance-based stock options and employee stock purchases. The grant-date fair value for service-based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nOption-pricing model assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on our common stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In deriving this assumption, we review actual historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled. For performance-based stock options, we also assess the projected timing of potential achievement of the milestones. The expected term of employees' purchase rights under our ESPP is equal to the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Zero Coupon Treasury Strip Yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data and are adjusted, if necessary, over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from their estimate.\nWe evaluate the assumptions used in estimating grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data on an annual basis. We have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods, the stock-based compensation expense that we record for share-based payment awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period. Thus, historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results. For example, in 2015 we reported net income for the first time due to recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. In addition, we expect to incur increasing operating losses in the future as we support our current Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF.\nWe are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development, including, but not limited to, risks inherent in research and development efforts, including the development, manufacture, regulatory approval for and commercialization of, imetelstat; uncertainty of non-clinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances; the future development of imetelstat by us, including any future efficacy or safety results that may cause the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat to become unacceptable; overcoming disruptions and/or delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic; our need for future capital; enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights; reliance upon our consultants, licensees, investigators and other third parties; and potential competition. In order for imetelstat to be\ncommercialized, we must conduct non-clinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of imetelstat, obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing, distribution and marketing arrangements, as well as obtain market acceptance. We do not expect to receive revenue based on sales of imetelstat for many years, if at all.\nRevenues\nWe previously entered into license or collaboration agreements with companies involved with oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production, whereby we granted certain rights to our non-imetelstat related technologies. As of December 31, 2020, our license agreements related to our human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, technology have been terminated or expired due to patent expirations on such technology. The remaining active license agreement was a license related to our specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry, as well as patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, the building blocks of oligonucleotides. This license recently has been terminated effective April 2021. In connection with these agreements, we were eligible to receive license fees, option fees, milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products, or any combination thereof. Also, in connection with the divestiture of Geron's human embryonic stem cell assets, including intellectual property and proprietary technology, to Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly BioTime, Inc. which acquired Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc.) in 2013, we are entitled to receive royalties on sales from certain research or commercial products utilizing Geron's former intellectual property.\nWe recognized license fee revenues of $55,000, $96,000 and $641,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to our various agreements. The decrease in license fee revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects a reduction in the number of active license agreements for research licenses related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology.\nWe recognized royalty revenues of $198,000, $364,000 and $425,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research-use-only market and cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs. The decrease in royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects expiration of licenses which eliminated the obligation to pay royalties on product sales. Royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect estimated royalties from sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell assets.\nFuture license fee and royalty revenues are dependent on additional agreements being signed, if any, our current license agreement being maintained and the underlying patent rights for the license remaining active. Historical revenues may not be predictive of future revenues. We expect revenues in 2021 to be lower than 2020 due to the termination and expiration of our license agreements related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology. In addition, due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs are expected to be lower which reduces the royalties payable to us.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, imetelstat was the sole research and development program we supported. For the imetelstat research and development program, we incur direct external, personnel related and other research and development costs. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, direct external expenses included costs for our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors and 100% of the clinical development costs incurred by Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period. For the year ended December 31, 2018, direct external expenses primarily consisted of our proportionate share of research and development costs incurred by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Personnel related expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes and benefits for Geron employees involved with ongoing research and development efforts. Other research and development expenses primarily consist of research-related overhead associated with allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other supplies.\nResearch and development expenses were $51.5 million, $52.1 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2020 primarily reflects the net result of lower direct external expenses due to the completion of the imetelstat program transition, the closing of IMbark and reduced purchases of raw materials, drug substance and drug product, partially offset by higher expenses for IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF. The increase in research and\ndevelopment expenses in 2019 primarily reflects higher direct external costs for clinical development activities. Such costs included: a) fees to our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors for imetelstat program transition; b) start-up expenses for IMerge Phase 3; c) 100% reimbursement to Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period and d) purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen. In addition, personnel related expenses have increased in 2020 and 2019 as a result of additional development headcount being hired.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct external research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical program: Imetelstat\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen was required to provide operational support for the imetelstat program through September 2019 during transition of the program to us, including continuing to support ongoing imetelstat clinical trials. We reimbursed Janssen for 100% of the costs for such operational support. However, costs associated with transition activities, such as transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials, moving databases and related systems and transmitting regulatory files, were incurred separately by each company, unless otherwise specified in the Collaboration Agreement. As of the end of September 2019, the transition of the imetelstat program to us from Janssen was completed according to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we support the current two Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF. At this time, we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to advance imetelstat toward commercialization. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of imetelstat, see the sub-sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $25.7 million, $20.9 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher personnel-related costs for additional headcount to support growing operational activities associated with bi-coastal offices, increased company headcount and international clinical trial activities, as well as increased legal costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as the imetelstat program matures and potential pre-commercialization preparatory activities begin.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $1.8 million, $4.2 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects lower yields on our marketable securities portfolio due to declining interest rates despite an increase in the size of our marketable securities portfolio. The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects higher yields on a larger marketable securities portfolio. Interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our marketable securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $760,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflects interest payments under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB. The Loan Agreement was effective September 30, 2020. As such, no comparable interest expense amounts were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nChange in Fair Value of Equity Investment\nWe remeasure the fair value of our equity investment at each reporting date and any resulting change in fair value based on observable price changes is included on our statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was an increase in fair value of our equity investment of $60,000 and a decrease in fair value of our equity investment of $195,000 and $541,000, respectively, resulting from observable price changes in the equity investment. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of the underlying equity investment and is therefore subject to volatility that could adversely affect our operating results.\nGain on Settlement\nIn July 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen, Inc., or ViaGen, filed an arbitration claim against Trans Ova Genetics, L.C., or Trans Ova, for alleged violations under a Share Purchase Agreement, or SPA, including failure to make payments under certain conditions. In December 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen agreed to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of $3.7 million, of which we received $1.5 million, which represents our 40% share of the settlement amount. With this settlement, Trans Ova has been released from any further obligations under the SPA, including any future payments. No comparable amounts were recognized in 2020 or 2019.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense was $168,000, $69,000 and $114,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized other income of $182,000 for the share exchange of our equity investment in Sienna Cancer Diagnostics, Limited upon its acquisition by BARD1 Life Sciences Limited, or BARD1. Also included in other income were realized losses of $34,000 for the sales of BARD1 shares during the third quarter of 2020. See Note 2 on Fair Value Measurement - Equity Investment in Notes to Financial Statements for further information.\nOther expense primarily reflects changes in the fair value of our equity investment resulting from foreign currency translation and bank charges related to our cash operating accounts and marketable securities portfolio. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar and is therefore subject to volatility, especially in light of the unpredictable market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our future operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $260.0 million, compared to $159.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and current and noncurrent marketable securities from December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of the receipt of net cash proceeds of approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by us, from an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying stock purchase warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, that we completed on May 27, 2020. In September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million, after deducting debt discounts and other debt issuance costs payable by us.\nWe have an investment policy to invest our cash in liquid, investment grade securities, such as interest-bearing money market funds, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, U.S. government and agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and commercial paper. Our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub-prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities or auction rate securities and, to date, we have not recognized any other-than-temporary impairment charges on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity. To date, we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents; however, access to our invested cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nIn May 2018, we entered into the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley FBR as our sales agent. Pursuant to the\n2018 Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR sold our common stock at market prices prevailing at the time of sale for which B. Riley FBR received an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds. From January 2020 through April 2020, we sold an aggregate of 3,496,616 shares of our common stock under the 2018 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million after deducting sales commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The 2018 Sales Agreement has been superseded by the 2020 Sales Agreement (see below).\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the 2018 Sales Agreement. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement. No shares were sold in 2020 under the 2020 Sales Agreement. See Note 9 on Stockholders' Equity in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2020 Sales Agreement. In the first quarter of 2021, we sold an aggregate of 7,948,505 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $16.2 million after deducting sales commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. See Note 12 on Subsequent Events in Notes to Financial Statements for sales under the 2020 Sales Agreement in 2021.\nWe estimate that our existing capital resources and future interest income will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next 12 months and potentially as long as through the end of 2022. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available after the end of 2022, we will require additional capital to reach top-line results. In any event, we will require substantial additional funding to further advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF. In addition, our ability to commercialize imetelstat in the United States, if regulatory approval is granted, depends on us being able to establish sales and marketing capabilities.\nBecause the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. In addition, our plans and timing expectations will be further delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, magnitude and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and potential future clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF and other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat; \n \u2022 delays or disruptions in opening sites, screening and enrolling patients or treating and following patients, in IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, such as obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals for IMpactMF in the United States and in other countries; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to achieve any meaningful reduction in manufacturing costs; \n \u2022 the costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CROs and CMOs, to pursue the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat; \n \u2022 our ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing and manufacturing of imetelstat and potential future commercialization and marketing; \n \u2022 our efforts to enhance operational, financial and management processes and systems that will be required for future development and commercialization of imetelstat, and our ability to successfully recruit and retain additional key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries, and the associated costs; \n \u2022 the costs and timing necessary to build a sales force in the United States to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory approval; \n \u2022 the sales price for imetelstat; \n \u2022 the availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat; \n \u2022 expenses associated with the pending putative securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation; \n \u2022 the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with potential future litigation; \n \u2022 the costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, telecommunications and administrative oversight, as well as higher expenses for travel when travel becomes possible in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \n \u2022 the costs of enabling our personnel to telecommute as required by federal, state and local shelter in place\u201d or comparable orders, including providing supplies, equipment and technology necessary for them to perform their responsibilities. \nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development and commercialization efforts. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from imetelstat to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, which may not be possible. Availability of such financing sources may be negatively impacted with any further delays in reporting results from IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF.\nAdditional financing through public or private debt or equity financings, including pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, to the extent available, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may be unable to raise equity capital, or may be forced to do so at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private debt and equity markets to proposed financings has been substantially affected by uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be affected by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased market volatility and could result in a significant long-term disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to raise additional funds through financings, and could negatively impact the terms upon which we may raise those funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Due to uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate, we may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to raise additional funds proactively\nto meet longer-term anticipated operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, we have borrowed, and in the future may borrow, additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund imetelstat development and our future growth, including pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms under agreements, such as the Loan Agreement, that include restrictive covenants, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Moreover, if we raise additional funds through alliance, collaborative or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our common stock, including under the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities or potential future drawdowns, if available, under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. In any event, we will continue to need substantial additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and potential commercialization of imetelstat in lower risk MDS and refractory MF, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development, including completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing, conducting or completing other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or pursuing potential commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and we might cease operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $66.7 million, $43.8 million and $21.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operating activities in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher payments for research and development expenses in connection with supporting the ongoing conduct of IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF, increases in development headcount, the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us and purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 was $105.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $27.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 primarily reflects a higher rate of purchases than maturities of marketable securities resulting from the investment of net cash proceeds from financings completed in 2020 and 2018. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily reflects a higher rate of maturities than purchases of marketable securities.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2020, we purchased approximately $830,000 in property and equipment, none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $168.3 million, $19.5 million and $93.0 million, respectively. Financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect the receipt of $140.2 million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock, pre-funded warrant and stock purchase warrants in May 2020, receipt of net cash proceeds from the sales of our common stock under the 2015 Sales Agreement with MLV and the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR and cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans. In addition, in September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million after deducting the debt discounts and debt issuance costs paid by us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1 and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. The information provided should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d, Risks Related to COVID-19\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nSummary\nGeron is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, an innovative therapeutic for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Geron's vision is to be recognized as a leader in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Geron is committed to improving and extending the lives of patients by changing the course of these diseases by targeting telomerase. We are currently focused on the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, a first in class telomerase inhibitor, and are conducting two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to enable registration: (i) IMerge Phase 3 in Low or Intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or lower risk MDS, and (ii) IMpactMF in Intermediate-2 or High-risk myelofibrosis, or refractory MF.\nLike many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, the pace of site opening and patient screening and enrollment was in line with our expectations. However, in the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to rapidly affect clinical trial sites around the world. Many of our clinical sites established self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment during this period out of concern for patient exposure to COVID-19 and due to lack of available staff. As a result, we experienced significant delays in site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment, in IMerge Phase 3. During the summer of 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases declined due to public health safety measures, some clinical sites removed their self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment, which improved the momentum of patient enrollment. However, beginning in November 2020, another steep rise in COVID-19 cases in most of the countries where IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted again negatively impacted the pace of enrollment. The emergence of COVID-19 variants also began, causing further unpredictability and uncertainty about the pace at which patients and healthcare workers would be able to return to clinical sites.\nSince vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, and we have begun to see the number of COVID-19 cases declining, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023. If full enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 completes after the third quarter of 2021, top-line results will not be available by the end of 2022.\nFor IMpactMF, COVID-19 has also negatively impacted clinical trial activities. In addition, in 2020 a number of competing trials were initiated in MF and other oncology indications in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. All plans and timing expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below.\nWe believe that data from two prior Phase 2 clinical trials provide strong evidence that imetelstat targets telomerase to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells in hematologic myeloid malignancies, potentially resulting in meaningful clinical benefits for patients. Data reported from our Phase 2 clinical\ntrial in lower risk MDS provide evidence that imetelstat may achieve meaningful and durable transfusion independence and increase in hemoglobin levels, suggesting potential recovery of normal blood cells. Similarly, data reported from our Phase 2 clinical trial in myelofibrosis, or MF, suggest imetelstat potentially improves overall survival, or OS, for MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor, or relapsed/refractory MF. Additionally, from these Phase 2 clinical trials, we have observed depletion of cytogenetic abnormalities and reductions in key driver mutations of the underlying diseases in both lower risk MDS and MF patients, as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis in MF patients, all of which we believe provides evidence of disease-modifying activity. Furthermore, these molecular and histology data have been correlated with the clinical benefits of transfusion independence in lower risk MDS and improved OS in relapsed/refractory MF. We believe the clinical benefits, molecular observations and correlations from these two Phase 2 trials highlight the magnitude of imetelstat's unique mechanism of action of telomerase inhibition, and provide strong evidence that imetelstat may alter the course of MDS and MF. We believe this disease-modifying activity has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nImetelstat has been granted Fast Track designations by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to lower risk MDS, who do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, also known as non-del(5q), and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, and for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MF. Imetelstat has also been granted orphan drug designations by the FDA in the United States and by the European Commission for the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union, or EU, for the treatment of MDS and also for the treatment of MF.\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the United States, and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in the United States could occur in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat independently in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in significant economic disruption, and has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business. As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty exists concerning the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are actively monitoring the situation and have taken and intend to take those actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our patients, investigators, employees and stockholders. For example, we have restricted access to our offices in California and New Jersey to essential activities for the health and safety of our employees and in compliance with local shelter-in place\u201d orders and suspended non-essential travel worldwide. Our employees have been able to work remotely without significant disruption to our business.\nAs discussed above, like many other biopharmaceutical companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations and patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials, IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor each clinical site through our contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as to conduct direct outreach to investigators and study staff. Due to the recent decline in COVID-19 cases and the commencement of vaccine distribution, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize in the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Taking into account these dynamic and evolving circumstances, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the\ntiming of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available during the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nFor IMpactMF, in addition to the negative impact of COVID-19, in 2020 a number of competing trials in MF and other oncology indications were initiated in the countries where we planned to conduct IMpactMF. As a result of these factors, site personnel resources are constrained at many clinical sites, causing delays in site initiation activities. Although we have expanded the number of countries and sites where we plan to conduct the trial, we now expect IMpactMF to be fully enrolled in 2024. Given these challenges, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected.\nThe fluidity and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any firm estimates as to the ultimate effect COVID-19 will have on our clinical trials, our operations and our business, all of which are highly reliant on the continued worldwide progress toward managing this health crisis. All plans and timing expectations will be delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities.\nIn alignment with recent guidance from the FDA on clinical trials, FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards,\u201d together with other national and regional guidelines outside the United States, we have taken steps designed to address unavoidable protocol deviations caused by COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures. In addition, we issued an Urgent Safety Measure together with a Dear Investigator Letter to all of our clinical sites involved with IMerge Phase 3 to apply certain measures to protect patient safety that include enhanced ongoing monitoring for signs and symptoms of or exposure to COVID-19 as well as guidance for withholding treatment to patients who have tested positive, who show signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19, or who have potential exposure to COVID-19. Similar guidance has been provided in our clinical trial protocol for IMpactMF.\nImetelstat - A Unique Drug Candidate Directed at a Novel Target Designed to Result in Disease-Modifying Activity\nTelomerase is an enzyme that is upregulated in many malignant stem and progenitor cells and allows them to proliferate without limitation, thereby driving tumor growth and progression. Imetelstat, our proprietary telomerase inhibitor, was designed to directly inhibit telomerase in malignant cells with continuously upregulated telomerase. We have global rights to imetelstat, which was discovered and first developed at Geron.\nData from our Phase 2 imetelstat clinical trials in lower risk MDS and relapsed/refractory MF showed dose- and exposure-dependent reductions of previously known pharmacodynamic markers, or biomarkers, of telomerase inhibition, such as telomerase activity, telomere length and expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, thereby indicating the on-target mechanism of action of imetelstat. Furthermore, these reductions in telomerase biomarkers correlated to better clinical outcomes for patients with higher telomerase activity, higher hTERT level and shorter telomere length. These biomarker data and the evidence of reductions in key driver mutations for MDS and MF, as well as cytogenetically abnormal clones, have been correlated to the clinical benefits observed in our Phase 2 clinical trials. In addition, these molecular data indicate by targeting telomerase, imetelstat inhibits the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem and progenitor cells resulting in apoptosis of malignant cells. We believe that the totality of these data provide strong evidence of disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment, which we believe has the potential to differentiate imetelstat from other currently approved and investigational treatments for MDS and MF.\nCompelling and Differentiating Phase 2 Data Support Phase 3 Development\nIn lower risk MDS, we reported more mature data from 38 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the IMerge clinical trial, or IMerge Phase 2, in June 2020. As reported previously, 42% (16/38) of patients achieved the primary endpoint of 8-week transfusion independence, and 75% (12/16) of these patients showed a hemoglobin rise of at least 3 grams per deciliter during the transfusion free interval when compared to pretreatment level. An important observation from the more mature data set was the longer durability of transfusion independence, including 29% (11/38) of patients being transfusion-free for more than one year, and a median duration of transfusion independence of 20 months. Such durability provides significant and meaningful clinical benefit to lower risk MDS patients, given their chronic anemia and the debilitating impact of serial blood transfusions, and further supports the disease-modifying potential of imetelstat treatment. Additional information about this more mature data is described in this annual report on Form\n10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, More Mature Data from IMerge Phase 2 Continue to Differentiate Imetelstat in Lower Risk MDS\u201d, including safety data, which remained consistent with safety data from prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies.\nIn relapsed/refractory MF, we previously reported efficacy and safety data from the IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial, including median OS of 28.1 months for patients on the high dose arm of the study, which is almost twice the reported median OS of 13 - 16 months in medical literature. In IMbark, patients also experienced other clinical benefits, including symptom improvement, spleen reduction and bone marrow fibrosis improvement. We reported recent correlation analyses from IMbark in June 2020 that showed a trend of longer OS in patients who achieved symptom response, spleen volume reductions and improved bone marrow fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Given the shortened survival for refractory MF patients, extended median OS would provide substantial clinical benefit. Additional information about the correlation analyses is described in this annual report on Form 10-K under Business\u201d in Part I, Item 1, under the sub-section entitled, Recently Reported Analyses of IMbark Phase 2 Data Provide Evidence of Improvement in OS and Disease-Modifying Potential of Imetelstat.\u201d\nOngoing Phase 3 Development\nIMerge Phase 3 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that, based on discussions with U.S. and European regulatory authorities, we believe may support, if successful, the registration of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 170 patients with lower risk transfusion dependent MDS relapsed/refractory to ESA, who have not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent, or HMA, or lenalidomide and are non-del(5q). IMerge Phase 3 is being conducted at over 100 medical centers globally, including North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. In December 2020, we achieved 50% of the planned patient enrollment, and in March 2021, we attained 65% of the planned patient enrollment. Taking into account the dynamic and evolving circumstances of COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect IMerge Phase 3 to be fully enrolled in the second half of 2021. Depending on the timing of full enrollment, we expect top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 to be available in the time period from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023.\nIMpactMF is designed to be an open label 2:1 randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate imetelstat versus best available therapy, or BAT, in approximately 320 patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF who are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor, or refractory MF. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe the current design of IMpactMF may support, if the trial is successful, the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Currently, we expect to engage over 180 sites to participate in IMpactMF across North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. In December 2020, we opened the first three trial sites to patient enrollment.\nGiven the challenges caused by COVID-19 on our clinical trial activities, under current planning assumptions, we expect the interim analysis for IMpactMF to occur in 2024 and the final analysis in 2025. Because these analyses are event-driven, the results may be available at different times than currently expected. At the interim analysis, if the pre-specified statistical OS criterion is met, we expect such data may support the registration of imetelstat in refractory MF. Subject to protocol-specified stopping rules for futility, if the pre-specified OS criterion is not met at the interim analysis, the trial will continue to the final analysis, which is expected to occur approximately one year after the interim analysis.\nPlan for Potential Commercialization of Imetelstat\nIn 2021, we have begun preparations for the future submissions of an NDA for imetelstat in the United States, and an MAA in Europe, for imetelstat in lower risk MDS, both of which we plan to submit in 2023, assuming enrollment in IMerge Phase 3 is completed by end of 2021, and top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available in 2023 supporting such submissions. We intend to discuss with the FDA options for a rolling submission process, as allowed under imetelstat's Fast Track designation in lower risk MDS. Under either a six-month priority review or a standard ten-month review process, upon potential approval by the FDA, we expect that commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS could occur in the United States in 2024. In Europe, we anticipate review of the MAA by the EMA could take approximately 12 months and commercial launch of imetelstat in lower risk MDS in Europe could occur in 2024.\nIf imetelstat is approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat ourselves in the United States and may seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States. Given these plans, we have developed a potential commercial launch plan, which includes potential financing plans\nthat are driven by the achievement of certain clinical milestones, such as top-line results. In 2021, we plan to conduct preliminary commercial preparations, such as building the internal infrastructure to support a commercial launch, conducting market research and hiring commercial leadership in medical affairs, pricing and market access and market analytics.\nPotential Patent Term Extensions and Market Exclusivity\nWe have issued U.S. and European patents pertaining to treatment of MF and MDS with imetelstat that extend patent coverage into 2033.\nWe also hold issued patents covering imetelstat composition of matter. In the United States, our composition of matter patent coverage extends through 2025. In Europe, our composition of matter patent coverage expires in 2024, and includes patent rights in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other member countries of the European Patent Convention. Potential patent term extensions may be available to extend our imetelstat composition of matter patent terms in the United States up to 2030 through provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (as amended), or the Hatch-Waxman Act, and in Europe up to 2029 under a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, permitted under European Council (EC) Regulation No. 469/2009, or the European SPC Regulation. In the United States and in Europe, the scope of protection under such a patent term extension, if any were granted, would be defined by the description of the imetelstat product as approved for marketing. An additional six-month extension of the protection under any SPC granted may be available in Europe pursuant to European Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 (Pediatric Regulation), or the European Pediatric Regulation. However, such pediatric extension of SPC protection is not available if a one-year extension of marketing exclusivity has already been granted in respect of a new pediatric indication.\nUpon drug product approval, there are additional extensions of regulatory exclusivity which we may receive. We have orphan drug designations for both MDS and MF in the United States and in Europe. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for seven years following drug product approval for the orphan disease indication. In Europe, under the European Union Orphan drug regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, orphan drug designation allows for market exclusivity for ten years following drug product approval for each of the orphan disease indications, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for two years pursuant to the European Pediatric Regulation. If we are unable to maintain orphan drug designation, upon drug product approval:\n \u2022 In the United States, we may have five years of new chemical entity, or NCE exclusivity, which includes data and market exclusivity, under the Hatch-Waxman Act; and \n \u2022 In European countries, we may have eight years of data exclusivity plus two years of market exclusivity through provisions of the European Union Data exclusivity Directive 2004/27/EC, with the potential for extension of market exclusivity for one year for a new pediatric indication being authorized. \nIn addition, a six month pediatric extension may be available in the United States pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, to the longest extension or exclusivity period available under a patent term extension, the NCE exclusivity period or the orphan drug exclusivity period.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities, interest income on our marketable securities and payments we received under our collaborative and licensing arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $260.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and current and noncurrent marketable securities, and long-term debt principal balance of $25.0 million.\nOn September 30, 2020, or the Closing Date, we, Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules, and Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, entered into a loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, for an aggregate principal amount up to $75.0 million that can be drawn in three tranches as follows: (i) Tranche A loan of up to $35.0 million of which $25.0 million was funded on the Closing Date and the remaining $10.0 million is available to be drawn until June 15, 2021, (ii) Tranche B loan of up to $15.0 million which is available to be drawn from January 1, 2021 to December 15, 2021, subject to achievement of certain clinical milestones, and (iii) Tranche C loan of up to $25.0 million available to be drawn through December 31, 2022, subject to approval by an investment committee comprised of Hercules and SVB.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $25.0 million under Tranche A has been drawn, and there have been no other amounts drawn under the other Tranches.\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities, Inc., or B. Riley Securities, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement that we entered on May 18, 2018, or the 2018 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley FBR, Inc., or B. Riley FBR. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement.\nOn May 27, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, or the stock purchase warrants. The combined public offering price of the common stock and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.30 per share. The combined public offering price of the pre-funded warrant and accompanying stock purchase warrants was $1.299 per share. The net cash proceeds from this offering were approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses paid by us, and excludes any future proceeds from the exercise of the pre-funded warrant or the stock purchase warrants.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaboration agreements, and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. We currently have no source of product revenue. While we reported a small profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to our recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, until 2015 we had never been profitable, and have not reported any profit since. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception in 1990, resulting principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.2 billion.\nThe significance of future losses, future revenues and any potential future profitability will depend primarily on the clinical and commercial success of imetelstat, our sole product candidate. In any event, imetelstat will require significant additional clinical testing prior to possible regulatory approval in the United States and other countries. We expect research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and losses to substantially increase in future periods as we continue to support the imetelstat development program through late-stage development, including the conduct and completion of IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF. To further advance the imetelstat program, including conducting the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to obtain regulatory approval for imetelstat and establishing sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize imetelstat in the United States on our own, if regulatory approval is granted, substantial additional capital will be required. If approved for marketing by regulatory authorities outside of the United States, we may seek potential commercialization partners for such territories. We do not expect imetelstat to be commercially available for many years, if at all.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.\nA critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (i) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and\n(ii) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes historically have been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our financial statements are stated fairly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe categorize financial instruments recorded at fair value on our balance sheets based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value. The categories are as follows:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2-Inputs (other than quoted market prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.\nLevel 3-Inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on our balance sheets, including the category for such financial instruments.\nFinancial instruments classified as Level 1 include money market funds and certificates of deposit, representing approximately 2% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. Financial instruments classified as Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and equity investments, representing approximately 98% of our total financial instruments classified as assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020. The price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources. Periodically, we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes as well as reviewing the pricing methodologies used by our portfolio managers. Historically, we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio managers' prices.\nFor a further discussion regarding fair value measurements, see Note 2 on Fair Value Measurements in Notes to Financial Statements of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. Financial results for the reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, Leases, or Topic 840.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Operating leases are included in operating leases, right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities on our balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the expected lease term. The present value of remaining lease payments within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current lease liabilities. The present value of lease payments not within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent lease liabilities. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts to calculate the present value is typically not readily determinable. As such, significant management judgment is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment as of the lease commencement date. We evaluate the assumptions used in estimating the incremental borrowing rate by reviewing industry and regional data for operating leases and loans with similar terms. We have not made any revisions to borrowing rate estimates. If the basis for the incremental borrowing rate estimate were to change, then the present value of remaining lease payments could differ significantly which would affect the value recognized for the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our balance sheets. See Note 7 on Operating Leases in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations.\nOn March 10, 2020, a new operating lease commitment for our offices in Foster City, California commenced upon the substantial completion of all tenant improvements. As of the lease commencement date, the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability was approximately $3.4 million, which represented the present value of remaining lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate of 7% over the initial lease term of 87 months, net of a three-month rent abatement period. Under the Foster City Lease, we are also obligated to pay certain variable expenses separately from the base rent, including taxes and common area maintenance. Such costs are considered non-lease components and have been excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and corresponding operating lease liability and are being expensed in the period they are incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nBeginning January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. In determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue to be recognized under Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with our customer; (ii) identify the promised goods or services in the agreement and determine whether they are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the agreement; (iii) measure the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on stand-alone selling prices; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. Significant management judgment is required to determine the level of effort required and the period over which completion of the performance obligations is expected under an agreement. If reasonable estimates regarding when performance obligations are either complete or substantially complete cannot be made, then revenue recognition is deferred until a reasonable estimate can be made. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current deferred revenue. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimated selling prices for license rights are calculated using an income approach model and include the following key assumptions, judgments and estimates: the development timeline, revenue forecast, commercialization expenses, discount rate and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nOur revenues historically have consisted of collaboration revenue, license fees and royalties. Collaboration revenue primarily represented amounts earned under the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen for the imetelstat program. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. License fees and royalty revenue primarily represents amounts earned under agreements that out-license our technology to various oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production companies. Economic terms in these agreements may include non-refundable upfront license payments in cash or equity securities, annual license maintenance fees, cost sharing arrangements, milestone payments, royalties on future sales of products, or any combination of these items. Non-refundable upfront fees, annual license maintenance fees and funding of research and\ndevelopment activities are considered fixed consideration, while milestone payments and royalties are identified as variable consideration.\nLicenses of Intellectual Property. If we determine the license to intellectual property is distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the agreement and the licensee can use and benefit from the license, we recognize revenue from non-refundable upfront fees allocated to the license upon the completion of the transfer of the license to the licensee. For such licenses, we recognize revenue from annual license maintenance fees upon the start of the new license period. For licenses that are bundled with other performance obligations, we assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable upfront fees or annual license maintenance fees. At each reporting period, we reassess the progress and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is included in the transaction price. For milestones that we do not deem to be probable of being achieved, the associated milestone payments are fully constrained and the value of the milestone is excluded from the transaction price with no revenue being recognized. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory-related accomplishments, are not considered probable of being achieved until those accomplishments have been communicated by the relevant regulatory authority. Once the assessment of probability of achievement becomes probable, we recognize revenue for the milestone payment. At each reporting date, we assess the probability of achievement of each milestone under our current agreements.\nRoyalties. For agreements with sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, where the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of: (a) when the related sales occur, or (b) when the performance obligation, to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated, has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). At each reporting date, we estimate the sales incurred by each licensee during the reporting period based on historical experience and accrue the associated royalty amount.\nCost Sharing Arrangements. Research and development and other expenses being shared by both parties under an agreement are recorded as earned or owed based on the performance obligations by both parties under the respective agreement. For arrangements in which we and our collaboration partner in the agreement are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize payments between the parties on a net basis and record such amounts as a reduction or addition to research and development expense. For arrangements in which we have agreed to perform certain research and development services for our collaboration partner and are not exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the activity, we recognize the respective cost reimbursements as revenue under the collaboration agreement over time in a manner proportionate to the costs we incurred to perform the services using the input method.\nRevenue recognition for licenses and collaboration agreements requires significant judgment. Our assessments and estimates are based on contractual terms, historical experience and general industry practice. Revisions in these values or estimations have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee or collaboration revenue in the period of revision. As of December 31, 2020, we have not made any revisions to revenue recognition estimates.\nClinical Trial Accruals\nOur current imetelstat clinical trials are being supported by third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors. We accrue expenses for clinical trial activities performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial. For clinical trial expenses and related expenses associated with the conduct of clinical trials, the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled, the number of active clinical sites, and the duration for which the patients have been enrolled in the trial. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, review of contractual terms and correspondence with CROs. We base our estimates on the best information available at the time. However, additional information may become available to us which will allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods. In that event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain. For the clinical development activities previously conducted by Janssen under the former Collaboration Agreement, we monitored patient enrollment levels and related\nactivities to the extent possible through discussions with Janssen personnel and based our estimates of clinical trial costs on the best information available at the time.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to our employees and directors, including service-based and performance-based stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, based on estimated grant-date fair values for these instruments. The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight-line method and reduced for estimated forfeitures. For performance-based stock options with vesting conditioned on the achievement of certain strategic milestones, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met and is reduced for estimated forfeitures, as applicable. If the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved, no stock-based compensation expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met, if at all. If that assessment of the probability of the performance condition being met changes, the impact of the change in estimate would be recognized in the period of the change. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of our service-based and performance-based stock options and employee stock purchases. The grant-date fair value for service-based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nOption-pricing model assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on our common stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In deriving this assumption, we review actual historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled. For performance-based stock options, we also assess the projected timing of potential achievement of the milestones. The expected term of employees' purchase rights under our ESPP is equal to the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Zero Coupon Treasury Strip Yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical data and are adjusted, if necessary, over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from their estimate.\nWe evaluate the assumptions used in estimating grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data on an annual basis. We have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate grant-date fair values of our share-based payment awards. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods, the stock-based compensation expense that we record for share-based payment awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period. Thus, historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results. For example, in 2015 we reported net income for the first time due to recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Effective September 28, 2018, the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen was terminated. As a result, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat. In addition, we expect to incur increasing operating losses in the future as we support our current Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF.\nWe are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development, including, but not limited to, risks inherent in research and development efforts, including the development, manufacture, regulatory approval for and commercialization of, imetelstat; uncertainty of non-clinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances; the future development of imetelstat by us, including any future efficacy or safety results that may cause the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat to become unacceptable; overcoming disruptions and/or delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic; our need for future capital; enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights; reliance upon our consultants, licensees, investigators and other third parties; and potential competition. In order for imetelstat to be\ncommercialized, we must conduct non-clinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of imetelstat, obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing, distribution and marketing arrangements, as well as obtain market acceptance. We do not expect to receive revenue based on sales of imetelstat for many years, if at all.\nRevenues\nWe previously entered into license or collaboration agreements with companies involved with oncology, diagnostics, research tools and biologics production, whereby we granted certain rights to our non-imetelstat related technologies. As of December 31, 2020, our license agreements related to our human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, technology have been terminated or expired due to patent expirations on such technology. The remaining active license agreement was a license related to our specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry, as well as patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, the building blocks of oligonucleotides. This license recently has been terminated effective April 2021. In connection with these agreements, we were eligible to receive license fees, option fees, milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products, or any combination thereof. Also, in connection with the divestiture of Geron's human embryonic stem cell assets, including intellectual property and proprietary technology, to Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly BioTime, Inc. which acquired Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc.) in 2013, we are entitled to receive royalties on sales from certain research or commercial products utilizing Geron's former intellectual property.\nWe recognized license fee revenues of $55,000, $96,000 and $641,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to our various agreements. The decrease in license fee revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects a reduction in the number of active license agreements for research licenses related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology.\nWe recognized royalty revenues of $198,000, $364,000 and $425,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research-use-only market and cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs. The decrease in royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects expiration of licenses which eliminated the obligation to pay royalties on product sales. Royalty revenues in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect estimated royalties from sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell assets.\nFuture license fee and royalty revenues are dependent on additional agreements being signed, if any, our current license agreement being maintained and the underlying patent rights for the license remaining active. Historical revenues may not be predictive of future revenues. We expect revenues in 2021 to be lower than 2020 due to the termination and expiration of our license agreements related to our hTERT technology due to the patent expirations on such technology. In addition, due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of cell-based research products from our divested stem cell programs are expected to be lower which reduces the royalties payable to us.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, imetelstat was the sole research and development program we supported. For the imetelstat research and development program, we incur direct external, personnel related and other research and development costs. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, direct external expenses included costs for our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors and 100% of the clinical development costs incurred by Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period. For the year ended December 31, 2018, direct external expenses primarily consisted of our proportionate share of research and development costs incurred by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. Personnel related expenses primarily consist of salaries and wages, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes and benefits for Geron employees involved with ongoing research and development efforts. Other research and development expenses primarily consist of research-related overhead associated with allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other supplies.\nResearch and development expenses were $51.5 million, $52.1 million and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2020 primarily reflects the net result of lower direct external expenses due to the completion of the imetelstat program transition, the closing of IMbark and reduced purchases of raw materials, drug substance and drug product, partially offset by higher expenses for IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF. The increase in research and\ndevelopment expenses in 2019 primarily reflects higher direct external costs for clinical development activities. Such costs included: a) fees to our CROs, consultants and other clinical-related vendors for imetelstat program transition; b) start-up expenses for IMerge Phase 3; c) 100% reimbursement to Janssen for operational support of the imetelstat program during the transition period and d) purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen. In addition, personnel related expenses have increased in 2020 and 2019 as a result of additional development headcount being hired.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen was required to provide operational support for the imetelstat program through September 2019 during transition of the program to us, including continuing to support ongoing imetelstat clinical trials. We reimbursed Janssen for 100% of the costs for such operational support. However, costs associated with transition activities, such as transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials, moving databases and related systems and transmitting regulatory files, were incurred separately by each company, unless otherwise specified in the Collaboration Agreement. As of the end of September 2019, the transition of the imetelstat program to us from Janssen was completed according to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we support the current two Phase 3 clinical trials of imetelstat, IMerge and IMpactMF. At this time, we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to advance imetelstat toward commercialization. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of imetelstat, see the sub-sections entitled Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat\u201d and Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance Matters and Commercialization of Imetelstat\u201d under Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $25.7 million, $20.9 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher personnel-related costs for additional headcount to support growing operational activities associated with bi-coastal offices, increased company headcount and international clinical trial activities, as well as increased legal costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as the imetelstat program matures and potential pre-commercialization preparatory activities begin.\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $1.8 million, $4.2 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects lower yields on our marketable securities portfolio due to declining interest rates despite an increase in the size of our marketable securities portfolio. The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflects higher yields on a larger marketable securities portfolio. Interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our marketable securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $760,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and reflects interest payments under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB. The Loan Agreement was effective September 30, 2020. As such, no comparable interest expense amounts were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nChange in Fair Value of Equity Investment\nWe remeasure the fair value of our equity investment at each reporting date and any resulting change in fair value based on observable price changes is included on our statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was an increase in fair value of our equity investment of $60,000 and a decrease in fair value of our equity investment of $195,000 and $541,000, respectively, resulting from observable price changes in the equity investment. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of the underlying equity investment and is therefore subject to volatility that could adversely affect our operating results.\nGain on Settlement\nIn July 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen, Inc., or ViaGen, filed an arbitration claim against Trans Ova Genetics, L.C., or Trans Ova, for alleged violations under a Share Purchase Agreement, or SPA, including failure to make payments under certain conditions. In December 2018, we and the other former shareholders of ViaGen agreed to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of $3.7 million, of which we received $1.5 million, which represents our 40% share of the settlement amount. With this settlement, Trans Ova has been released from any further obligations under the SPA, including any future payments. No comparable amounts were recognized in 2020 or 2019.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income and expense was $168,000, $69,000 and $114,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized other income of $182,000 for the share exchange of our equity investment in Sienna Cancer Diagnostics, Limited upon its acquisition by BARD1 Life Sciences Limited, or BARD1. Also included in other income were realized losses of $34,000 for the sales of BARD1 shares during the third quarter of 2020. See Note 2 on Fair Value Measurement - Equity Investment in Notes to Financial Statements for further information.\nOther expense primarily reflects changes in the fair value of our equity investment resulting from foreign currency translation and bank charges related to our cash operating accounts and marketable securities portfolio. The fair value of our equity investment fluctuates based on changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar and is therefore subject to volatility, especially in light of the unpredictable market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that could adversely affect our future operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $260.0 million, compared to $159.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and current and noncurrent marketable securities from December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of the receipt of net cash proceeds of approximately $140.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses payable by us, from an underwritten public offering of 107,049,375 shares of our common stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase 8,335,239 shares of our common stock, together with accompanying stock purchase warrants to purchase 57,692,307 shares of our common stock, that we completed on May 27, 2020. In September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million, after deducting debt discounts and other debt issuance costs payable by us.\nWe have an investment policy to invest our cash in liquid, investment grade securities, such as interest-bearing money market funds, certificates of deposit, municipal securities, U.S. government and agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate notes and commercial paper. Our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub-prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities or auction rate securities and, to date, we have not recognized any other-than-temporary impairment charges on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity. To date, we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents; however, access to our invested cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nIn May 2018, we entered into the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley FBR as our sales agent. Pursuant to the\n2018 Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR sold our common stock at market prices prevailing at the time of sale for which B. Riley FBR received an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds. From January 2020 through April 2020, we sold an aggregate of 3,496,616 shares of our common stock under the 2018 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $4.1 million after deducting sales commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. The 2018 Sales Agreement has been superseded by the 2020 Sales Agreement (see below).\nOn September 4, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or the 2020 Sales Agreement, with B. Riley Securities pursuant to which we may elect to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in such quantities and on such minimum price terms as we set from time to time through B. Riley Securities as our sales agent. We agreed to pay B. Riley Securities an aggregate commission rate equal to up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share for common stock sold through B. Riley Securities under the 2020 Sales Agreement. In connection with the 2020 Sales Agreement, we terminated the 2018 Sales Agreement. On September 4, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3, or the registration statement, which includes a prospectus, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time after the effectiveness of the registration statement, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million under the 2020 Sales Agreement. No shares were sold in 2020 under the 2020 Sales Agreement. See Note 9 on Stockholders' Equity in Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2020 Sales Agreement. In the first quarter of 2021, we sold an aggregate of 7,948,505 shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately $16.2 million after deducting sales commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. See Note 12 on Subsequent Events in Notes to Financial Statements for sales under the 2020 Sales Agreement in 2021.\nWe estimate that our existing capital resources and future interest income will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least the next 12 months and potentially as long as through the end of 2022. If top-line results from IMerge Phase 3 are available after the end of 2022, we will require additional capital to reach top-line results. In any event, we will require substantial additional funding to further advance the imetelstat program, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and conducting the clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market in lower risk MDS and refractory MF. In addition, our ability to commercialize imetelstat in the United States, if regulatory approval is granted, depends on us being able to establish sales and marketing capabilities.\nBecause the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. In addition, our plans and timing expectations will be further delayed or interrupted if COVID-19 pandemic conditions continue unabated, or worsen, creating further limitations on our clinical trial activities. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, timing, magnitude and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries; \n \u2022 the scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and potential future clinical trials, including IMerge Phase 3, IMpactMF and other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat; \n \u2022 delays or disruptions in opening sites, screening and enrolling patients or treating and following patients, in IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, whether as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reasons; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, such as obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals for IMpactMF in the United States and in other countries; \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; \n \u2022 the costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to achieve any meaningful reduction in manufacturing costs; \n \u2022 the costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CROs and CMOs, to pursue the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat; \n \u2022 our ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing and manufacturing of imetelstat and potential future commercialization and marketing; \n \u2022 our efforts to enhance operational, financial and management processes and systems that will be required for future development and commercialization of imetelstat, and our ability to successfully recruit and retain additional key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries, and the associated costs; \n \u2022 the costs and timing necessary to build a sales force in the United States to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory approval; \n \u2022 the sales price for imetelstat; \n \u2022 the availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat; \n \u2022 expenses associated with the pending putative securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits, as well as any other potential litigation; \n \u2022 the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with potential future litigation; \n \u2022 the costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, telecommunications and administrative oversight, as well as higher expenses for travel when travel becomes possible in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and \n \u2022 the costs of enabling our personnel to telecommute as required by federal, state and local shelter in place\u201d or comparable orders, including providing supplies, equipment and technology necessary for them to perform their responsibilities. \nWe do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our development and commercialization efforts. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from imetelstat to finance our cash requirements, which we may never achieve, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements, which may not be possible. Availability of such financing sources may be negatively impacted with any further delays in reporting results from IMerge Phase 3 or IMpactMF.\nAdditional financing through public or private debt or equity financings, including pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, to the extent available, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may be unable to raise equity capital, or may be forced to do so at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private debt and equity markets to proposed financings has been substantially affected by uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be affected by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased market volatility and could result in a significant long-term disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to raise additional funds through financings, and could negatively impact the terms upon which we may raise those funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Due to uncertainty in the general economic, market and political climate, we may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to raise additional funds proactively\nto meet longer-term anticipated operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, we have borrowed, and in the future may borrow, additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund imetelstat development and our future growth, including pursuant to our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms under agreements, such as the Loan Agreement, that include restrictive covenants, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Moreover, if we raise additional funds through alliance, collaborative or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our common stock, including under the 2020 Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities or potential future drawdowns, if available, under our Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. In any event, we will continue to need substantial additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development, including through IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF and potential commercialization of imetelstat in lower risk MDS and refractory MF, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development, including completing IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF, or commencing, conducting or completing other potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or pursuing potential commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and we might cease operations.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $66.7 million, $43.8 million and $21.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net cash used in operating activities in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects higher payments for research and development expenses in connection with supporting the ongoing conduct of IMerge Phase 3 and start-up activities for IMpactMF, increases in development headcount, the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us and purchase of inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 was $105.3 million and $77.7 million, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 was $27.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2018 primarily reflects a higher rate of purchases than maturities of marketable securities resulting from the investment of net cash proceeds from financings completed in 2020 and 2018. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2019 primarily reflects a higher rate of maturities than purchases of marketable securities.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2020, we purchased approximately $830,000 in property and equipment, none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $168.3 million, $19.5 million and $93.0 million, respectively. Financing activities in 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect the receipt of $140.2 million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock, pre-funded warrant and stock purchase warrants in May 2020, receipt of net cash proceeds from the sales of our common stock under the 2015 Sales Agreement with MLV and the 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR and cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans. In addition, in September 2020, we drew down $25.0 million under the Loan Agreement with Hercules and SVB, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $23.9 million after deducting the debt discounts and debt issuance costs paid by us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 273: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct external research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical program: Imetelstat\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Geron is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing imetelstat for hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelofibrosis (MF). \n\n- The company's operations and financial condition have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused delays in clinical trial site initiations and patient enrollment. Under current assumptions, Geron expects full enrollment in the IMerge Phase 3 trial in lower risk MDS in second half of 2021, with topline results by end of 2022 to first half of 2023.\n\n- Research and development expenses were $51.5 million in 2020, down slightly from $52.1 million in 2019 due to lower direct external expenses related to the imetelstat program transition, offset by higher costs for IMerge Phase 3 and IMpactMF startup.\n\n- General and administrative expenses rose to $25.7 million in 2020 from $20.9 million in 2019 due to higher personnel costs and legal expenses. \n\n- As of December 31, 2020, Geron had $260 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, up from $159.2 million at end of 2019, primarily due to a public stock offering and debt financing.\n\n- The company estimates existing capital resources are sufficient to fund current operations through at least next 12 months and potentially through end of 2022. Additional financing will be needed to complete IMerge Phase 3 if results are delayed beyond 2022.\n\n- Future capital requirements depend on progress and costs of imetelstat clinical trials and regulatory activities as well as costs to build commercialization and marketing capabilities."}
