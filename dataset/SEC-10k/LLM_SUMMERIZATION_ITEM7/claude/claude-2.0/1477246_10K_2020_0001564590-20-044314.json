In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as referred to on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company. We are market leaders in the breeding, production and sale of alfalfa seed and sorghum seed. We also have a growing commercial market presence in sunflower, wheat and pasture seed and maintain an active stevia development program.\nOur seed platform develops and supplies high quality germplasm designed to produce higher yields for farmers worldwide. We sell over 500 seed products in more than 40 countries. We maintain an active product pipeline and expect to introduce more than 25 new products during the 2021-2022 fiscal years.\nFounded in 1980, we began our operations as a limited producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties bred for warm climates and high-yields, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils. Over the years we have built a diversified, global agricultural platform through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2012 acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., which enabled us to expand production of non-GMO alfalfa seed into California's Imperial Valley, thereby ensuring a non-GMO uncontaminated source of alfalfa seed due to the prohibition on growing GMO crops in the Imperial Valley, as well as enabling us to diversify our production areas and distribution channels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2012 acquisition of a portfolio of dormant alfalfa germplasm, which launched our entry into the dormant alfalfa market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2013 acquisition of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd (now S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd, or S&W Australia), the leading producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed in South Australia, which made us the largest non-dormant alfalfa seed company in the world, with production capabilities in both hemispheres;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2014 acquisition of alfalfa production and research facility assets and conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa germplasm from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., or Pioneer (now a subsidiary of Corteva Agriscience, Inc., or Corteva), which substantially broadened and improved our dormant alfalfa germplasm portfolio and deepened our production, research and product development capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2016 acquisition of the business and assets of SV Genetics Pty Ltd, a developer of proprietary hybrid sorghum and sunflower seed germplasm, which expanded our crop focus into two areas which we believe have high global growth potential;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2018 acquisition of the assets of Chromatin, Inc. and related companies, which positioned us to become a global leader in the hybrid sorghum seed market and enhanced our distribution channels both internationally and within a U.S.-based farmer-dealer network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our 2018 joint venture with AGT Foods Africa Proprietary Limited and 2019 joint venture with Zaad Holdings Limited, both based in South Africa, each of which were formed to produce our hybrid sunflower, grain sorghum and forage sorghum seed in Africa for sale in Africa, the Middle East and Europe;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our May 2019 restructuring of our relationship with Pioneer, a subsidiary of Corteva, which we jointly refer to as Corteva, under which, among other things:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> We received $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.55 million in September 2019, $5.55 million in January 2020, $5.55 million in February 2020, $3.75 million in September 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $4.6 million in additional payments on the dates and in the amounts as set forth below.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 15, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,500,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 15, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,100,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,601,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> o\n</td> <td> Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa varieties world-wide (except South America).

We expect to generate alfalfa seed revenue of approximately $15 million from Corteva over the fiscal 2021 period as the seed is delivered to Corteva through February 2021. We do not expect any other significant revenue from sales to Corteva in the future.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and have implemented measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a voluntary work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. We are continuing our activities and are taking precautionary measures to protect our employees working in our facilities.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak could have a negative impact on our sales, operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales, operating results and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn particular, our sales cycle is highly seasonal, and the majority of our sales season activities for the United States and Australia are typically concentrated between March and June of each year. Our sales efforts also have historically involved significant in-person interaction with potential customers and distributors. In March 2020, at the beginning of what is typically our most active selling period, many national, state and local governments in our target markets implemented various stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and other quarantine measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we immediately attempted to shift our sales activities to video conferencing and similar customer interaction models, but we have found these alternative approaches to generally be less effective than in-person sales efforts.\nIn addition, our product revenue is predicated on our ability to timely fulfill customer orders, which depends in large part upon the consistent availability and operation of shipping and distribution networks operated by third parties. Farmers typically have a limited window during which they can plant seed, and their buying decisions can be shaped by actual or perceived disruptions in our distribution and supply channels. If our customers delay or decrease their orders due to potential disruptions in our distribution and supply channels, this would adversely affect our product revenue.\nGiven these uncertainties, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nComponents of Our Statements of Operations Data\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nProduct and Other Revenue\nWe derive most of our revenue from the sale of our proprietary seed varieties and hybrids. We expect that over the next several years, a substantial majority of our revenue will be generated from the sale of alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower and pasture seed, although we are continually assessing other possible product offerings or means to increase revenue, including expanding into other, higher margin crops.\nThe mix of our product offerings will continue to change over time with the introduction of new seed varieties and hybrids resulting from our robust research and development efforts, including our potential expansion into gene-edited products in future periods.\nOur revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of orders from our customers and distributors. Because some of our large customers and distributors order in bulk only one or two times per year, our product revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. However, some of this fluctuation is offset by having operations in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\nOur stevia breeding program has yet to generate any meaningful revenue. However, management continues to evaluate this portion of our business and assess various means to monetize the results of our effort to breed new, better tasting stevia varieties. Such potential opportunities include possible licensing agreements and royalty-based agreements.\nLicensing Revenue\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of the our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and six pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue relates to sale of our seed products and consists of the cost of procuring seed, plant conditioning and packaging costs, direct labor and raw materials and overhead costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery, development, breeding and testing of new products incorporating the traits we have specifically selected. These expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits, consultant services, land leased for field trials, chemicals and supplies and other external expenses.\nOverall, we have been focused on controlling research and development expenses, while balancing that objective against the recognition that continued advancement in product development is an important part of our strategic planning. We intend to focus our resources on high value activities. For alfalfa seed, we plan to invest in further development of differentiating forage quality traits. For sorghum, we plan to invest in higher value grain products, proprietary herbicide tolerance traits and improved safety and palatability in forage products. We expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of various research and development projects.\nOur internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred, while third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. The costs associated with equipment or facilities acquired or construed for research and development activities that have alternative future uses are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee costs, including salaries, employee benefits and share-based compensation, as well as professional service fees, insurance, marketing, travel and entertainment expense, public company expense and other overhead costs. We proactively take steps on an ongoing basis to control selling, general and administrative expense as much as is reasonably possible.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets, including those acquired from Pasture Genetics in 2020, Chromatin in 2018 and from SV Genetics in May 2016, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 10-30 years for technology/IP/germplasm, 5-20 years for customer relationships and trade names and 3-20 years for other intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 5-35 years for buildings, 2-20 years for machinery and equipment and 2-5 years for vehicles.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, change in contingent consideration obligation, government grant income, changes in the estimated fair value of assets held for sale and interest expense in connection with amortization of debt discount. Interest expense primarily consists of interest costs related to outstanding borrowings on our working capital credit facilities and our financing with Conterra Agricultural Capital, LLC, or Conterra.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates, differences in the deductibility of certain expenses and inclusion of certain income items between financial statement and tax return purposes, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. Tax regulations require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when those items are required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as meals and entertainment expenses that are not fully deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets. The full valuation allowance was recorded during the fiscal year 2017 as a result of changes to our operating results and future projections, resulting from a decline in export sales to Saudi Arabia. As a result, we don't believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nRevenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $79.6 million compared to $109.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $30.1 million decrease in revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue received from Pioneer. In May 2019, we terminated the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, and entered into a new license agreement with Corteva.\nAs part of the termination, Corteva agreed to purchase certain quantities of seed held by us as of the date of the termination, which Pioneer was not previously obligated to purchase. Those quantities of seed will be delivered to Corteva periodically through February 2021. Contemporaneously with the termination, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and nine pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties. We received a payment of $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.6 million in September 2019, $5.6 million in January 2020, $5.6 million in February 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $8.4 million in additional payments through February 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2020 we recorded product sales of $19.7 million to Pioneer, which was a decrease of $18.0 million from the year ended June 30, 2019 amount of $37.6 million. Additionally, we recorded one-time license revenue of $34.2 million from Pioneer in the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue to Pioneer was partially offset by an increase of $21.9 million in Core Revenue. Core Revenue (excluding product and license revenue attributable to Pioneer) for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $59.9 million compared to Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $37.9\nmillion, representing an increase of 58%. Included in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $11.8 million of revenue pertaining to a partial period contribution from our acquisition of Pasture Genetics which occurred on February 24, 2020. Excluding contributions from Pasture Genetics, Core Revenue growth was 27%. Due to the revised agreements entered into with Pioneer in May 2019, we plan to provide Core Revenue as a metric to track performance of our business.\nThe increase in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 can be attributed to an increase in alfalfa in Saudi Arabia and sorghum sales in the United States as well as growth in Pakistan, Europe and South Africa.\nSales into international markets represented 54% and 20% of our total revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Domestic revenue accounted for 46% and 80% of our total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to the termination of the Pioneer and Corteva agreement mentioned above and our recent Pasture Genetics acquisition. We anticipate that international sales as a percentage of our total revenue will increase for fiscal 2021 as a result of the acquisition of Pasture Genetics and our expanded Australian market footprint.\nThe following table shows revenue from external sources by destination country:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,724,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,176,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Australia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,079,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,787,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Saudi Arabia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,189,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,745,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mexico\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,454,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,264,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> South Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,182,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 797,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pakistan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,124,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,009,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Italy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sudan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,308,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 717,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Libya\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,142,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> France\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,040,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 845,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,934,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,422,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,582,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,722,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue of $64.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 was equal to 81.2% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020, while the cost of revenue of $69.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 was equal to 62.9% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of revenue increased on a percentage basis primarily due to the license revenue generated during the year ended June 30, 2019, which did not recur during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nTotal gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was 18.8% compared to 37.1% in the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the decrease in license revenue. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 included a $2.3 million inventory write-down. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2019 included one-time license revenue of $34.2 million and an inventory write-down of $8.8 million.\nExcluding the $2.3 million of inventory write-downs, gross margin would have been 21.7% for the year ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the $8.8 million of inventory write-downs and the $34.2 million of license revenue, gross margin would have been 20.3% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in adjusted gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily driven by improved gross margins in alfalfa. We believe its useful to exclude inventory write-downs and one-time license revenue in calculating adjusted gross margins in order to provide investors with a method to compare our operating results to prior periods and to peer companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative, or SG&A expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $21.3 million compared to $17.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $3.9 million increase in SG&A expense versus the prior year was primarily due to $3.2 million of additional investment in sales and marketing, $1.2 million from our newly acquired Pasture Genetics operations, $0.7 million for management personnel, $0.5 million for stock based compensation, $0.5 million for IT and cyber security consulting, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.3 million and other decreases. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 26.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to 15.9% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $7.3 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.0 million increase in research and development expense versus the prior year is driven by additional research and development activities incurred in connection with the Chromatin business following our October 2018 acquisition, as well as additional investment in our hybrid sorghum and sunflower programs and wheat program in Australia.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $5.0 million compared to $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Included in the amount was amortization expense for intangible assets, which totaled $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 and $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense over the prior year is primarily driven by $0.4 million of additional Chromatin expenses following the October 2018 acquisition, $0.2 million of expense associated with our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, $0.3 million of expense associated with amortization of right of use assets and $0.2 million of additional expenses following the Dow Wheat Acquisition in August 2019, partially offset by fully depreciated assets.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 related to the full impairment of our goodwill and was a result of the termination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer/Corteva.\nThe termination of the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer was, in our view, a potential indicator of impairment due to the significant reduction in future forecasted revenues. As a result, we initiated an impairment test and concluded that the entire goodwill balance was impaired.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 was a result of the\ntermination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer. The intangible asset write-off related to the carrying value of the distribution agreement, which previously was being amortized over the contractual life of the agreement.\nChange in Estimated Value of Assets Held for Sale\nThe Company recorded $0.1 million and $1.5 of expenses for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The expense related to our estimated change in value of certain properties held for sale.\nChange in contingent consideration obligation\nThe contingent consideration obligation is considered a level 3 fair value financial instrument and will be measured at each reporting period. The $0.3 million benefit to non-cash change in contingent consideration obligation for the year ended June 30, 2020 represents the decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation associated with the February 2020 Pasture Genetics acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Amortization of Debt Discount\nNon-cash amortization of debt discount expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $0.6 million compared to $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The expense in both years represents the amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our working capital facilities, our secured property note and our equipment finance leases.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $2.0 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with CIBC, KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. The $0.9 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest on the working capital credit facilities and decreased levels of borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense totaled $0.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was (2.0%) for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 1.6% for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was relatively consistent year over year. The slight decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in our non-US income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Previously, we had certain intangible assets with indefinite lives for financial reporting purposes which produced deferred tax liabilities that could not be offset by a valuation allowance. During fiscal year 2019, we wrote down a majority of these assets for financial reporting purposes, generating a net deferred tax asset balance with respect to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, which is now fully offset by our valuation allowance. The increase to the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2019 generated a tax benefit and a positive effective tax rate, as opposed to the previous year when the increase in our net deferred tax liability balance produced an income tax provision and a negative effective tax rate. Due to the valuation allowance, we do not record the income tax expense or benefit related to substantially all of our current year operating results, as such results are generally incorporated in our net operating loss deferred tax asset position, which has a full valuation allowance against it. However, we did record tax expense related to certain other items occurring throughout the year. For example, we recorded income tax expense related to the current and prior year tax return filings of certain of our subsidiaries located in Australia and South Africa and also recorded tax expense related to current year state tax return liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital and working capital requirements fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the phase of the growing and sales cycle that falls during a particular quarter. Our need for cash has historically been highest in the second and third fiscal quarters (October through March) because we historically have paid our North American contracted growers progressively, starting in the second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2020, we paid our North American growers approximately 50% of amounts due in the fall of 2019 and the balance was paid in the spring of 2020. This payment cycle to our growers was similar in fiscal year 2019, and we expect it to be similar for fiscal year 2021. S&W Australia and Pasture Genetics, our Australian-based subsidiaries, have production cycles that are counter-cyclical to North America; however, this also puts a greater demand on our working capital and working capital requirements during the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters based on timing of payments to growers in the second through fourth quarters.\nHistorically, due to the concentration of sales to certain distributors, our month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter sales and associated cash receipts are highly dependent upon the timing of deliveries to and payments from these distributors, which varies significantly from year to year.\nWe continuously monitor and evaluate our credit policies with all of our customers based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of the respective trade accounts receivable balance. Our principal working capital components include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payable and our working capital lines of credit.\nOn February 24, 2020, S&W Australia acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pasture Genetics, the PG Acquisition, for an initial consideration that consisted of an upfront cash payment at closing of USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). A potential earn-out payment of up to USD $5.3 million (AUD $8.0 million), or the Earn-Out, is payable on September 30, 2022, or the Earn-Out Date. The amount of any Earn-Out will be equal to the excess, if any, of (a) 7.5, multiplied by the average of an agreed-upon calculation of Pasture Genetics' earnings over fiscal years 2021 and 2022, above (b) USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). At S&W Australia's election, up to 50% of the Earn-Out may be paid in shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price equal to the volume-weighted average purchase price of our common stock during the 10-day period ending immediately prior to the Earn-Out Date.\nIn addition to funding our business with cash from operations, we have historically relied upon occasional sales of our debt and equity securities and credit facilities from financial institutions, both in the United States and South Australia.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent and duration of future operating income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level and timing of future sales and expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> working capital required to support our growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment capital for plant and equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our sales and marketing programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment capital for potential acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> market developments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. It is possible that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will occur. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may affect our ability to raise equity capital, borrow on our existing facilities or make any additional necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. In addition, while we are currently in compliance with our loan agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic may compromise our ability to comply with the terms of our loan agreements and could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, our lenders could accelerate our repayment obligations or enforce their other rights under our agreements with them. Any such default may also require us to seek additional or alternative financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn recent periods, we have consummated the following equity and debt financings:\nDebt Financings\nLoan and Security Agreement with CIBC\nOn December 26, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with CIBC, or the Loan Agreement, which we amended on September 22, 2020. As amended, the Loan Agreement provides for a $25.0 million credit facility, or the CIBC Credit Facility. The key terms of the amended Loan Agreement include the following:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Advances under the CIBC Credit Facility are to be used: (i) to refinance indebtedness to KeyBank, discussed below; (ii) to finance our ongoing working capital requirements; and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

The CIBC Credit Facility also contains customary and usual financial covenants imposed by CIBC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of June 30, 2020, we were not in compliance with a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.10 to 1.00, tested as of June 30, 2020. Pursuant to the September 2020 amendment to the Loan Agreement, CIBC waived the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2020, and agreed to suspend its applicability prospectively until the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, we must maintain a fixed charge coverage equal to or greater than 1.15 to 1.00. Commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2020, through and including December 31, 2020, the amendment provides that we must comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain year-to-date EBITDA (as calculated in the Loan Agreement) of no less than negative $6,000,000, tested quarterly. This covenant will not apply for periods after December 31, 2020.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with our covenants in the Loan Agreement in the future, or secure additional waivers if or when required. If we are unable to comply with or obtain a waiver of any noncompliance under the Loan Agreement, CIBC could declare an event of default or require us to further renegotiate the Loan Agreement on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us, or we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing. If we were to seek additional or alternative financing, any such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any declaration by CIBC of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nTermination of KeyBank Credit Facility\nIn connection with the consummation of the Loan Agreement with CIBC described above, we terminated the Credit and Security Agreement, dated September 22, 2015, as subsequently amended, with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank. In connection with such termination, we paid KeyBank approximately $5.9 million in aggregate principal, interest and fees that were outstanding and payable under this agreement at the time of its termination, and all liens on our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries guaranteeing such facility, together with such subsidiary guarantees, were released and terminated. This agreement had provided for borrowings of up to a $45.0 million revolving line of credit.\nConterra Transaction\nIn November 2017, we entered into a secured note financing transaction with Conterra for $12.5 million in gross proceeds. In the transaction, we issued two secured promissory notes to Conterra. The first promissory note, in the principal amount of $10.4 million, or the Secured Real Estate Note is secured by a first priority security interest in the property, plant and fixtures located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities and our Nampa, Idaho research facilities. The note was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2020, which was extended to November 30, 2022 pursuant to a December 24, 2019 amendment. The note bears interest of 7.75% per annum. We have agreed to make (i) a principal and interest payment of approximately $515,711 on January 1, 2020; (ii) five consecutive semi-annual principal and interest payments of approximately $454,185, beginning on July 1, 2020; and (iii) a one-time final payment of approximately $8,957,095 on November 30, 2022. The second promissory note in the principal amount of $2.1 million, was secured by a first security interest in certain equipment not attached to the real estate located at the facilities noted above. In August 2018 we paid off in full this note pursuant to the sale-leaseback transaction discussed below.\nWe may prepay the note, in whole or in part, at any time.\nEquipment Sale-Leaseback\nIn August 2018, we closed on a sale-leaseback transaction with American AgCredit involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the sale-leaseback transaction:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We sold the equipment to American AgCredit for $2.1 million in proceeds.

S&W Australia has a series of debt facilities with NAB providing for up to AUD $25,337,000 (USD $17,353,000) of credit, the key terms of which were amended in February 2020 (in connection with the Pasture Genetics acquisition) and include the following:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> S&W Australia finances the purchase of most of its seed inventory from growers pursuant to a seasonal credit facility comprised of two facility lines: (i) an overdraft line having a credit limit of AUD $2,000,000 (USD $1,369,800 at June 30, 2020) and (ii) a borrowing base line having a credit limit of AUD $16,000,000 (USD $10,958,400 at June 30, 2020). The seasonal credit facility expires on March 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2020, the Borrowing Base Line accrued interest on Australian dollar drawings at approximately 3.7% per annum calculated daily. The Overdraft Facility permits S&W Australia to borrow funds on a revolving line of credit up to the credit limit. Interest accrues daily and is calculated by applying the daily interest rate to the balance owing at the end of the day and is payable monthly in arrears. As of June 30, 2020, the Overdraft Facility accrued interest at approximately 5.47% per annum calculated daily. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $14,000,000 (USD $9,588,600) was outstanding under S&W Australia's seasonal credit facility with NAB.

If the loan proceeds are fully utilized to pay qualified expenses, the full principal amount of the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan, along with any accrued interest, may qualify for loan forgiveness, subject to potential reduction based on the level of full-time employees maintained by the organization.\nWhen we applied for the loan, we believed we would qualify to have the loan forgiven under the terms of PPP, and therefore considered the loan to be substantively a conditional government grant. We have performed initial calculations for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect that the PPP loan will be forgiven in full because 1) we have, prior\nto June 30, 2020, utilized all of the proceeds for payroll and other qualified expenses and 2) we believe we will continue to comply with other terms and conditions necessary for forgiveness.\nWe plan to submit the PPP loan forgiveness application in the near term. Although we believe it is probable that the PPP loan will be forgiven, our actions and information must be evaluated by the lender and SBA before forgiveness is formally granted.\nEquity Issuances\nIn September 2018, we sold 1,607,717 shares of our common stock to MFP at a purchase price of $3.11 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $5.0 million.\nIn October 2018, we issued to MFP 7,235 shares of a newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $3,110 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million. The preferred shares carried no voting rights and were automatically convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1,000 shares of common stock per preferred share upon the approval of our stockholders for the issuance of the requisite shares of common stock. Pursuant to the purchase agreement for the preferred shares, we agreed to use reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of our shareholders for the issuance of stock upon the conversion of the preferred shares. Approval was obtained in November 2018 and the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted into 7,235,000 shares of our common stock.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,763,627\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,295,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,286,370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,566,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,049,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,630,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (308,410\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (250,073\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 691,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (889,092\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,431,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,320,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,123,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,431,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, operating activities used $5.8 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $11.0 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $5.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in inventory of $11.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.9 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, operating activities provided $21.3 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $24.5 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $3.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in inventory of $13.3 million, offset by increases in deferred revenue of $8.1 million related to the Corteva license agreement and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 used $10.3 million in cash. The Dow Wheat Acquisition accounted for $2.6 million of the cash used in investing activities and the Pasture Genetics Acquisition accounted for $7.5 million. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $2.0 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our distribution facility in Keith, Australia, research and development facilities in Tamworth, Australia and leasehold improvements to our new corporate headquarters in Longmont, Colorado; partially offset by $1.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of properties in Arlington Wisconsin and Plainview Texas.\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 used $26.6 million in cash. The Chromatin Acquisition accounted for $26.4 million of the cash used in investing activities. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $0.7 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our facility in Keith, Australia and replacements of our vehicle fleet in the US.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 provided $17.0 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we had net borrowings on the working capital lines of credit of $16.8 million, borrowings of long-term debt of $3.9 million and repayments of long-term debt of $2.6 million and debt issuance costs of $0.9 million.\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 provided $4.6 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we completed a private placement of common stock which raised net proceeds of $4.9 million in cash and a private placement of preferred stock which raised net proceeds of $22.4 million. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we also had net repayments on the working capital lines of credit of $21.3 million. On August 15, 2018, we closed on a sale and leaseback transaction involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold the equipment for $2.1 million in proceeds.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including our revenue and income from continuing operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent and duration of future operating income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the level and timing of future sales and expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> working capital required to support our growth;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment capital for plant and equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our sales and marketing programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment capital for potential acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> market developments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates are set forth in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, we must select and apply various accounting policies. Our most significant policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. In order to apply our accounting policies, we often need to make estimates based on judgments about future events. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. However, the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our results of operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition may be materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or to take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition. Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with the audit committee of our board of directors, and do so on a regular basis.\nWe believe that the following estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments. In addition, had we used estimates different from any of these, our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition for the current period could have been materially different from those presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit. We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04, effective July 1, 2018. This standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, we perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its one reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe goodwill balance at June 30, 2020 relates to our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics. Upon completing the impairment test on its one reporting unit, there was no impairment for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we terminated our production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, thereby triggering a potential indicator of goodwill impairment. As a result, we initiated a goodwill impairment test for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nWe compared the carrying value of our invested capital to estimated fair values at June 30, 2019. We estimated the fair value based on the income approach. The discounted cash flows served as the primary basis for the income approach and were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation. The income approach valuation included estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.6%.\nUpon completing the impairment test, we determined that the fair value of invested capital was less than the carrying value by approximately 10%, thus indicating an impairment. We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which represented the entire goodwill balance prior to the impairment charge.\nIntangible Assets\nAll amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible. If the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset, the carrying amount of the intangible is compared to its fair value, with an impairment loss recognized if the fair value is below carrying value. Fair values are typically estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Significant changes in key assumptions about the business, market conditions and prospects for which the intangible asset is currently utilized or expected to be utilized could result in an impairment charge.\nIn conjunction with the termination of the Pioneer production and distribution agreements, we recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge of intangible assets related to the Pioneer distribution agreements for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services. Under such provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, under the straight-line method, over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant).\nWe account for equity instruments, including stock options issued to non-employees, in accordance with authoritative guidance for equity-based payments to non-employees (FASB ASC 505-50). Stock options issued to non-employees are accounted for at their estimated fair value. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is re-measured as they vest.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under share-based compensation plans. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires us to estimate a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the expected term of the award, stock price volatility, dividend rate, risk-free interest rate. The input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. The expected term used represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding. We have used the historical volatility for our stock for the expected volatility assumption required in the model, as it is more representative of future stock price trends. We use a risk-free interest rate that is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issued with an equivalent remaining term at the time of grant. We have not paid dividends in the past and currently do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, and as such, dividend yield is assumed to be zero for the purposes of valuing the stock options granted. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change, and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. When there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees, our share-based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants.\nIncome Taxes\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent management believes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, an income tax charge is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. If the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated, we would be required to write-off the\nremaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision, resulting in a reduction of earnings and stockholders' equity.\nInventories\nAll inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods. Depending on market conditions, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. The factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans and expected market conditions. We perform a review of our inventory by product line on a quarterly basis.\nOur subsidiary, S&W Australia, does not fix the final price for seed payable to its growers until the completion of a given year's sales cycle pursuant to its standard contract production agreement. We record an estimated unit price accordingly, inventory, cost of revenue and gross profits are based upon management's best estimate of the final purchase price to our S&W Australia growers. To the extent the estimated purchase price varies from the final purchase price for seed, the adjustment to actual could materially impact the results in the period when the difference between estimates and actuals are identified. If the actual purchase price is in excess of our estimated purchase price, this would negatively impact our financial results including a reduction in gross profits and earnings.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $8.8 million, which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. $4.8 million of this write-down related to dormant alfalfa seed products. The termination of the distribution and production agreements with Pioneer altered our planned consumption of these varieties and as a result we determined this particular dormant seed inventory will need to be sold to alternative sales channels at lower selling prices. The remaining inventory write-down primarily relates to changes in our assessment of the future market prices for non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties. The changes in our assessment occurred as we updated our business plans taking into account activity during the fourth quarter, which is the height of the sales season for non-dormant varieties.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $2.3 million which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The write-down of inventory during the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to certain inventory lots that deteriorated in quality and germination rates during the year.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe regularly assess the collectability of receivables and provide an allowance for doubtful trade receivables equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. That estimate is based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as referred to on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company. We are market leaders in the breeding, production and sale of alfalfa seed and sorghum seed. We also have a growing commercial market presence in sunflower, wheat and pasture seed and maintain an active stevia development program.\nOur seed platform develops and supplies high quality germplasm designed to produce higher yields for farmers worldwide. We sell over 500 seed products in more than 40 countries. We maintain an active product pipeline and expect to introduce more than 25 new products during the 2021-2022 fiscal years.\nFounded in 1980, we began our operations as a limited producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties bred for warm climates and high-yields, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils. Over the years we have built a diversified, global agricultural platform through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including:\n \u2022 Our 2012 acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., which enabled us to expand production of non-GMO alfalfa seed into California's Imperial Valley, thereby ensuring a non-GMO uncontaminated source of alfalfa seed due to the prohibition on growing GMO crops in the Imperial Valley, as well as enabling us to diversify our production areas and distribution channels; \n \u2022 Our 2012 acquisition of a portfolio of dormant alfalfa germplasm, which launched our entry into the dormant alfalfa market; \n \u2022 Our 2013 acquisition of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd (now S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd, or S&W Australia), the leading producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed in South Australia, which made us the largest non-dormant alfalfa seed company in the world, with production capabilities in both hemispheres; \n \u2022 Our 2014 acquisition of alfalfa production and research facility assets and conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa germplasm from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., or Pioneer (now a subsidiary of Corteva Agriscience, Inc., or Corteva), which substantially broadened and improved our dormant alfalfa germplasm portfolio and deepened our production, research and product development capabilities; \n \u2022 Our 2016 acquisition of the business and assets of SV Genetics Pty Ltd, a developer of proprietary hybrid sorghum and sunflower seed germplasm, which expanded our crop focus into two areas which we believe have high global growth potential; \n \u2022 Our 2018 acquisition of the assets of Chromatin, Inc. and related companies, which positioned us to become a global leader in the hybrid sorghum seed market and enhanced our distribution channels both internationally and within a U.S.-based farmer-dealer network; \n \u2022 Our 2018 joint venture with AGT Foods Africa Proprietary Limited and 2019 joint venture with Zaad Holdings Limited, both based in South Africa, each of which were formed to produce our hybrid sunflower, grain sorghum and forage sorghum seed in Africa for sale in Africa, the Middle East and Europe; \n \u2022 Our May 2019 restructuring of our relationship with Pioneer, a subsidiary of Corteva, which we jointly refer to as Corteva, under which, among other things: \n o We received $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.55 million in September 2019, $5.55 million in January 2020, $5.55 million in February 2020, $3.75 million in September 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $4.6 million in additional payments on the dates and in the amounts as set forth below. \nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 15, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,500,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> February 15, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,100,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,601,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n o Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed varieties include certain of our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and six pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties. Corteva received no license to our other commercial alfalfa varieties or pre-commercial alfalfa pipeline products and no rights to any future products developed by us. \n o We assigned to Corteva grower production contract rights, and Corteva assumed grower production contract obligations, related to the licensed and certain other alfalfa varieties. \n o Our prior Distribution Agreement, related to conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties, and Contract Alfalfa Production Services Agreement, related to GMO-traited alfalfa varieties, with Corteva both terminated. Under the Distribution Agreement, Corteva was obligated to make minimum annual purchases from us. \n \u2022 Our 2019 license of commercialized and developmental wheat germplasm from Corteva, through which we entered the largest grain crop market in Australia; \n \u2022 Our 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics Ltd., or Pasture Genetics, the third largest pasture seed company in Australia, which further diversified our product offerings in Australia and strengthened our Australian sales team and distribution relationships; \n \u2022 Our 2020 collaboration with ADAMA Ltd., or ADAMA, a subsidiary of China National Chemical Engineering Co Ltd., or ChemChina, to bring to the U.S. sorghum market the DoubleTeamTM grassy weed management system, consisting of ADAMA's proprietary herbicides and our non-GMO, herbicide tolerant sorghum hybrids; and \n \u2022 Our 2020 licensing agreement with The Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., an affiliate of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, to develop and commercialize worldwide a non-GMO, dhurrin-free trait in sorghum species, which essentially eliminates potential livestock death from hydrogen cyanide poisoning when grazing sorghum \nAs a result of the 2018 Chromatin acquisition, the 2019 restructuring of our relationship with Corteva and our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, we expect that our results of operations for fiscal 2021 and future periods will differ significantly from prior periods as the mix of our product portfolio rebalances away from a reliance on alfalfa sales (sales of alfalfa seed to Corteva totaled $19.7 million and $37.6 million during the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively) to a more diverse product mix. We expect to generate alfalfa seed revenue of approximately $15 million from Corteva over the fiscal 2021 period as the seed is delivered to Corteva through February 2021. We do not expect any other significant revenue from sales to Corteva in the future.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and have implemented measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a voluntary work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. We are continuing our activities and are taking precautionary measures to protect our employees working in our facilities.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak could have a negative impact on our sales, operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales, operating results and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn particular, our sales cycle is highly seasonal, and the majority of our sales season activities for the United States and Australia are typically concentrated between March and June of each year. Our sales efforts also have historically involved significant in-person interaction with potential customers and distributors. In March 2020, at the beginning of what is typically our most active selling period, many national, state and local governments in our target markets implemented various stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and other quarantine measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we immediately attempted to shift our sales activities to video conferencing and similar customer interaction models, but we have found these alternative approaches to generally be less effective than in-person sales efforts.\nIn addition, our product revenue is predicated on our ability to timely fulfill customer orders, which depends in large part upon the consistent availability and operation of shipping and distribution networks operated by third parties. Farmers typically have a limited window during which they can plant seed, and their buying decisions can be shaped by actual or perceived disruptions in our distribution and supply channels. If our customers delay or decrease their orders due to potential disruptions in our distribution and supply channels, this would adversely affect our product revenue.\nGiven these uncertainties, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nComponents of Our Statements of Operations Data\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nProduct and Other Revenue\nWe derive most of our revenue from the sale of our proprietary seed varieties and hybrids. We expect that over the next several years, a substantial majority of our revenue will be generated from the sale of alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower and pasture seed, although we are continually assessing other possible product offerings or means to increase revenue, including expanding into other, higher margin crops.\nThe mix of our product offerings will continue to change over time with the introduction of new seed varieties and hybrids resulting from our robust research and development efforts, including our potential expansion into gene-edited products in future periods.\nOur revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of orders from our customers and distributors. Because some of our large customers and distributors order in bulk only one or two times per year, our product revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. However, some of this fluctuation is offset by having operations in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\nOur stevia breeding program has yet to generate any meaningful revenue. However, management continues to evaluate this portion of our business and assess various means to monetize the results of our effort to breed new, better tasting stevia varieties. Such potential opportunities include possible licensing agreements and royalty-based agreements.\nLicensing Revenue\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of the our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and six pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue relates to sale of our seed products and consists of the cost of procuring seed, plant conditioning and packaging costs, direct labor and raw materials and overhead costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery, development, breeding and testing of new products incorporating the traits we have specifically selected. These expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits, consultant services, land leased for field trials, chemicals and supplies and other external expenses.\nOverall, we have been focused on controlling research and development expenses, while balancing that objective against the recognition that continued advancement in product development is an important part of our strategic planning. We intend to focus our resources on high value activities. For alfalfa seed, we plan to invest in further development of differentiating forage quality traits. For sorghum, we plan to invest in higher value grain products, proprietary herbicide tolerance traits and improved safety and palatability in forage products. We expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of various research and development projects.\nOur internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred, while third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. The costs associated with equipment or facilities acquired or construed for research and development activities that have alternative future uses are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee costs, including salaries, employee benefits and share-based compensation, as well as professional service fees, insurance, marketing, travel and entertainment expense, public company expense and other overhead costs. We proactively take steps on an ongoing basis to control selling, general and administrative expense as much as is reasonably possible.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets, including those acquired from Pasture Genetics in 2020, Chromatin in 2018 and from SV Genetics in May 2016, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 10-30 years for technology/IP/germplasm, 5-20 years for customer relationships and trade names and 3-20 years for other intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 5-35 years for buildings, 2-20 years for machinery and equipment and 2-5 years for vehicles.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, change in contingent consideration obligation, government grant income, changes in the estimated fair value of assets held for sale and interest expense in connection with amortization of debt discount. Interest expense primarily consists of interest costs related to outstanding borrowings on our working capital credit facilities and our financing with Conterra Agricultural Capital, LLC, or Conterra.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates, differences in the deductibility of certain expenses and inclusion of certain income items between financial statement and tax return purposes, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. Tax regulations require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when those items are required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as meals and entertainment expenses that are not fully deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets. The full valuation allowance was recorded during the fiscal year 2017 as a result of changes to our operating results and future projections, resulting from a decline in export sales to Saudi Arabia. As a result, we don't believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nRevenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $79.6 million compared to $109.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $30.1 million decrease in revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue received from Pioneer. In May 2019, we terminated the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, and entered into a new license agreement with Corteva.\nAs part of the termination, Corteva agreed to purchase certain quantities of seed held by us as of the date of the termination, which Pioneer was not previously obligated to purchase. Those quantities of seed will be delivered to Corteva periodically through February 2021. Contemporaneously with the termination, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and nine pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties. We received a payment of $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.6 million in September 2019, $5.6 million in January 2020, $5.6 million in February 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $8.4 million in additional payments through February 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2020 we recorded product sales of $19.7 million to Pioneer, which was a decrease of $18.0 million from the year ended June 30, 2019 amount of $37.6 million. Additionally, we recorded one-time license revenue of $34.2 million from Pioneer in the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue to Pioneer was partially offset by an increase of $21.9 million in Core Revenue. Core Revenue (excluding product and license revenue attributable to Pioneer) for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $59.9 million compared to Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $37.9\nmillion, representing an increase of 58%. Included in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $11.8 million of revenue pertaining to a partial period contribution from our acquisition of Pasture Genetics which occurred on February 24, 2020. Excluding contributions from Pasture Genetics, Core Revenue growth was 27%. Due to the revised agreements entered into with Pioneer in May 2019, we plan to provide Core Revenue as a metric to track performance of our business.\nThe increase in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 can be attributed to an increase in alfalfa in Saudi Arabia and sorghum sales in the United States as well as growth in Pakistan, Europe and South Africa.\nSales into international markets represented 54% and 20% of our total revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Domestic revenue accounted for 46% and 80% of our total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to the termination of the Pioneer and Corteva agreement mentioned above and our recent Pasture Genetics acquisition. We anticipate that international sales as a percentage of our total revenue will increase for fiscal 2021 as a result of the acquisition of Pasture Genetics and our expanded Australian market footprint.\nThe following table shows revenue from external sources by destination country:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,724,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,176,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Australia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,079,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,787,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Saudi Arabia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,189,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,745,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mexico\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,454,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,264,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> South Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,182,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 797,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pakistan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,124,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,009,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Italy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sudan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,308,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 717,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Libya\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,142,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,629,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> France\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,040,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 845,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,934,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,422,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,582,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,722,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue of $64.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 was equal to 81.2% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020, while the cost of revenue of $69.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 was equal to 62.9% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of revenue increased on a percentage basis primarily due to the license revenue generated during the year ended June 30, 2019, which did not recur during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nTotal gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was 18.8% compared to 37.1% in the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the decrease in license revenue. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 included a $2.3 million inventory write-down. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2019 included one-time license revenue of $34.2 million and an inventory write-down of $8.8 million.\nExcluding the $2.3 million of inventory write-downs, gross margin would have been 21.7% for the year ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the $8.8 million of inventory write-downs and the $34.2 million of license revenue, gross margin would have been 20.3% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in adjusted gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily driven by improved gross margins in alfalfa. We believe its useful to exclude inventory write-downs and one-time license revenue in calculating adjusted gross margins in order to provide investors with a method to compare our operating results to prior periods and to peer companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative, or SG&A expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $21.3 million compared to $17.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $3.9 million increase in SG&A expense versus the prior year was primarily due to $3.2 million of additional investment in sales and marketing, $1.2 million from our newly acquired Pasture Genetics operations, $0.7 million for management personnel, $0.5 million for stock based compensation, $0.5 million for IT and cyber security consulting, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.3 million and other decreases. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 26.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to 15.9% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $7.3 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.0 million increase in research and development expense versus the prior year is driven by additional research and development activities incurred in connection with the Chromatin business following our October 2018 acquisition, as well as additional investment in our hybrid sorghum and sunflower programs and wheat program in Australia.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $5.0 million compared to $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Included in the amount was amortization expense for intangible assets, which totaled $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 and $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense over the prior year is primarily driven by $0.4 million of additional Chromatin expenses following the October 2018 acquisition, $0.2 million of expense associated with our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, $0.3 million of expense associated with amortization of right of use assets and $0.2 million of additional expenses following the Dow Wheat Acquisition in August 2019, partially offset by fully depreciated assets.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 related to the full impairment of our goodwill and was a result of the termination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer/Corteva.\nThe termination of the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer was, in our view, a potential indicator of impairment due to the significant reduction in future forecasted revenues. As a result, we initiated an impairment test and concluded that the entire goodwill balance was impaired.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 was a result of the\ntermination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer. The intangible asset write-off related to the carrying value of the distribution agreement, which previously was being amortized over the contractual life of the agreement.\nChange in Estimated Value of Assets Held for Sale\nThe Company recorded $0.1 million and $1.5 of expenses for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The expense related to our estimated change in value of certain properties held for sale.\nChange in contingent consideration obligation\nThe contingent consideration obligation is considered a level 3 fair value financial instrument and will be measured at each reporting period. The $0.3 million benefit to non-cash change in contingent consideration obligation for the year ended June 30, 2020 represents the decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation associated with the February 2020 Pasture Genetics acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Amortization of Debt Discount\nNon-cash amortization of debt discount expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $0.6 million compared to $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The expense in both years represents the amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our working capital facilities, our secured property note and our equipment finance leases.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $2.0 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with CIBC, KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. The $0.9 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest on the working capital credit facilities and decreased levels of borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense totaled $0.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was (2.0%) for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 1.6% for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was relatively consistent year over year. The slight decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in our non-US income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Previously, we had certain intangible assets with indefinite lives for financial reporting purposes which produced deferred tax liabilities that could not be offset by a valuation allowance. During fiscal year 2019, we wrote down a majority of these assets for financial reporting purposes, generating a net deferred tax asset balance with respect to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, which is now fully offset by our valuation allowance. The increase to the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2019 generated a tax benefit and a positive effective tax rate, as opposed to the previous year when the increase in our net deferred tax liability balance produced an income tax provision and a negative effective tax rate. Due to the valuation allowance, we do not record the income tax expense or benefit related to substantially all of our current year operating results, as such results are generally incorporated in our net operating loss deferred tax asset position, which has a full valuation allowance against it. However, we did record tax expense related to certain other items occurring throughout the year. For example, we recorded income tax expense related to the current and prior year tax return filings of certain of our subsidiaries located in Australia and South Africa and also recorded tax expense related to current year state tax return liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital and working capital requirements fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the phase of the growing and sales cycle that falls during a particular quarter. Our need for cash has historically been highest in the second and third fiscal quarters (October through March) because we historically have paid our North American contracted growers progressively, starting in the second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2020, we paid our North American growers approximately 50% of amounts due in the fall of 2019 and the balance was paid in the spring of 2020. This payment cycle to our growers was similar in fiscal year 2019, and we expect it to be similar for fiscal year 2021. S&W Australia and Pasture Genetics, our Australian-based subsidiaries, have production cycles that are counter-cyclical to North America; however, this also puts a greater demand on our working capital and working capital requirements during the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters based on timing of payments to growers in the second through fourth quarters.\nHistorically, due to the concentration of sales to certain distributors, our month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter sales and associated cash receipts are highly dependent upon the timing of deliveries to and payments from these distributors, which varies significantly from year to year.\nWe continuously monitor and evaluate our credit policies with all of our customers based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of the respective trade accounts receivable balance. Our principal working capital components include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payable and our working capital lines of credit.\nOn February 24, 2020, S&W Australia acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pasture Genetics, the PG Acquisition, for an initial consideration that consisted of an upfront cash payment at closing of USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). A potential earn-out payment of up to USD $5.3 million (AUD $8.0 million), or the Earn-Out, is payable on September 30, 2022, or the Earn-Out Date. The amount of any Earn-Out will be equal to the excess, if any, of (a) 7.5, multiplied by the average of an agreed-upon calculation of Pasture Genetics' earnings over fiscal years 2021 and 2022, above (b) USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). At S&W Australia's election, up to 50% of the Earn-Out may be paid in shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price equal to the volume-weighted average purchase price of our common stock during the 10-day period ending immediately prior to the Earn-Out Date.\nIn addition to funding our business with cash from operations, we have historically relied upon occasional sales of our debt and equity securities and credit facilities from financial institutions, both in the United States and South Australia.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 the extent and duration of future operating income; \n \u2022 the level and timing of future sales and expenditures; \n \u2022 working capital required to support our growth; \n \u2022 investment capital for plant and equipment; \n \u2022 our sales and marketing programs; \n \u2022 investment capital for potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms; \n \u2022 competition; \n \u2022 market developments; and \n \u2022 developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. It is possible that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will occur. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may affect our ability to raise equity capital, borrow on our existing facilities or make any additional necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. In addition, while we are currently in compliance with our loan agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic may compromise our ability to comply with the terms of our loan agreements and could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, our lenders could accelerate our repayment obligations or enforce their other rights under our agreements with them. Any such default may also require us to seek additional or alternative financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn recent periods, we have consummated the following equity and debt financings:\nDebt Financings\nLoan and Security Agreement with CIBC\nOn December 26, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with CIBC, or the Loan Agreement, which we amended on September 22, 2020. As amended, the Loan Agreement provides for a $25.0 million credit facility, or the CIBC Credit Facility. The key terms of the amended Loan Agreement include the following:\n \u2022 Advances under the CIBC Credit Facility are to be used: (i) to refinance indebtedness to KeyBank, discussed below; (ii) to finance our ongoing working capital requirements; and (iii) for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the CIBC Credit Facility to finance permitted acquisitions and related costs. \n \u2022 All amounts due and owing, including, but not limited to, accrued and unpaid principal and interest due under the CIBC Credit Facility, will be payable in full on December 23, 2022. \n \u2022 The Credit Facility generally establishes a borrowing base of up to 85% of eligible domestic accounts receivable (90% of eligible foreign accounts receivable) plus up to the lesser of (i) 65% of eligible inventory, (ii) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, and (iii) an eligible inventory sublimit as more fully set forth in the Loan Agreement, in each case, subject to lender reserves. \n \u2022 Loans may be based on (i) a Base Rate plus 1.0% per annum or (ii) LIBOR Rate plus 3.0% per annum (both as defined in the Loan Agreement), generally at our option. In the event of a default, at the option of CIBC, the interest rate on all obligations owing will increase by 2% per annum over the rate otherwise applicable. \n \u2022 The CIBC Credit Facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets (subject to certain exceptions), including intellectual property. \n \u2022 The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default that permit CIBC to accelerate our outstanding obligations \n under the Credit Facility, all as set forth in the Loan Agreement and related documents. The CIBC Credit Facility also contains customary and usual financial covenants imposed by CIBC. \nAs of June 30, 2020, we were not in compliance with a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.10 to 1.00, tested as of June 30, 2020. Pursuant to the September 2020 amendment to the Loan Agreement, CIBC waived the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2020, and agreed to suspend its applicability prospectively until the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, we must maintain a fixed charge coverage equal to or greater than 1.15 to 1.00. Commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2020, through and including December 31, 2020, the amendment provides that we must comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain year-to-date EBITDA (as calculated in the Loan Agreement) of no less than negative $6,000,000, tested quarterly. This covenant will not apply for periods after December 31, 2020.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with our covenants in the Loan Agreement in the future, or secure additional waivers if or when required. If we are unable to comply with or obtain a waiver of any noncompliance under the Loan Agreement, CIBC could declare an event of default or require us to further renegotiate the Loan Agreement on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us, or we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing. If we were to seek additional or alternative financing, any such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any declaration by CIBC of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nTermination of KeyBank Credit Facility\nIn connection with the consummation of the Loan Agreement with CIBC described above, we terminated the Credit and Security Agreement, dated September 22, 2015, as subsequently amended, with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank. In connection with such termination, we paid KeyBank approximately $5.9 million in aggregate principal, interest and fees that were outstanding and payable under this agreement at the time of its termination, and all liens on our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries guaranteeing such facility, together with such subsidiary guarantees, were released and terminated. This agreement had provided for borrowings of up to a $45.0 million revolving line of credit.\nConterra Transaction\nIn November 2017, we entered into a secured note financing transaction with Conterra for $12.5 million in gross proceeds. In the transaction, we issued two secured promissory notes to Conterra. The first promissory note, in the principal amount of $10.4 million, or the Secured Real Estate Note is secured by a first priority security interest in the property, plant and fixtures located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities and our Nampa, Idaho research facilities. The note was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2020, which was extended to November 30, 2022 pursuant to a December 24, 2019 amendment. The note bears interest of 7.75% per annum. We have agreed to make (i) a principal and interest payment of approximately $515,711 on January 1, 2020; (ii) five consecutive semi-annual principal and interest payments of approximately $454,185, beginning on July 1, 2020; and (iii) a one-time final payment of approximately $8,957,095 on November 30, 2022. The second promissory note in the principal amount of $2.1 million, was secured by a first security interest in certain equipment not attached to the real estate located at the facilities noted above. In August 2018 we paid off in full this note pursuant to the sale-leaseback transaction discussed below.\nWe may prepay the note, in whole or in part, at any time.\nEquipment Sale-Leaseback\nIn August 2018, we closed on a sale-leaseback transaction with American AgCredit involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the sale-leaseback transaction:\n \u2022 We sold the equipment to American AgCredit for $2.1 million in proceeds. The proceeds were used to pay off in full the Conterra promissory note mentioned above. \n \u2022 We entered into a lease agreement with American AgCredit relating to the equipment. The lease agreement has a five-year term and provides for monthly lease payments of $40,023 (representing an annual interest rate of 5.6%). At the end of the lease term, we will repurchase the equipment for $1. \nAustralian Facilities\nS&W Australia and Pasture Genetics both have debt facilities with NAB, all of which are guaranteed by us up to a maximum of AUD $15,000,000 (USD $10,273,500 at June 30, 2020) and cross-guaranteed by S&W Australia and Pasture Genetics.\nS&W Australia. S&W Australia has a series of debt facilities with NAB providing for up to AUD $25,337,000 (USD $17,353,000) of credit, the key terms of which were amended in February 2020 (in connection with the Pasture Genetics acquisition) and include the following:\n \u2022 S&W Australia finances the purchase of most of its seed inventory from growers pursuant to a seasonal credit facility comprised of two facility lines: (i) an overdraft line having a credit limit of AUD $2,000,000 (USD $1,369,800 at June 30, 2020) and (ii) a borrowing base line having a credit limit of AUD $16,000,000 (USD $10,958,400 at June 30, 2020). The seasonal credit facility expires on March 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2020, the Borrowing Base Line accrued interest on Australian dollar drawings at approximately 3.7% per annum calculated daily. The Overdraft Facility permits S&W Australia to borrow funds on a revolving line of credit up to the credit limit. Interest accrues daily and is calculated by applying the daily interest rate to the balance owing at the end of the day and is payable monthly in arrears. As of June 30, 2020, the Overdraft Facility accrued interest at approximately 5.47% per annum calculated daily. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $14,000,000 (USD $9,588,600) was outstanding under S&W Australia's seasonal credit facility with NAB. The seasonal credit facility is secured by a fixed and floating lien over all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of S&W Australia. S&W Australia was in compliance with all debt covenants under the seasonal credit facility at June 30, 2020. \n \u2022 S&W Australia has a flexible rate loan, or the Term Loan, in the amount of AUD $5.0 million (USD $3,424,500 at June 30, 2020). Required annual principal payments of AUD $500,000 on the Term Loan will commence on November 30, 2020, with the remainder of any unpaid balance becoming due on March 31, 2025. Monthly interest amounts outstanding under the Term Loan will be payable in arrears at a floating rate quoted by NAB for the applicable pricing period, plus 2.6%. The Term Loan is secured by a lien on all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of S&W Australia. \n \u2022 S&W Australia finances certain equipment purchases under a master asset finance facility with NAB. The master asset finance facility has various maturity dates through 2023 and have interest rates ranging from 3.47% to 5.31%. The credit limit under the facility is AUD $2,000,000 (USD $1,369,800) at June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $839,869 (USD $575,226) was outstanding under S&W Australia's master asset finance facility. \n \u2022 S&W Australia has a Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility for the machinery and equipment used in the operations of the Keith building. The Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility bears interest, payable in arrears, based on the Australian Trade Refinance Rate quoted by NAB at the time of the drawdown, plus 2.9%. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $137,503 (USD $94,176) was outstanding under the Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility. \nS&W Australia was in compliance with all debt covenants under its debt facilities with NAB at June 30, 2020.\nPasture Genetics. Pasture Genetics has a working capital facility with NAB and a facility with TOYOTA Finance to finance purchase of vehicles.\n \u2022 Pasture Genetics has a working capital facility with NAB with a credit limit of AUD $10.0 million (USD $6,849,000 at June 30, 2020) and a borrowing base determined from qualified inventory and accounts receivable. The facility will expire on March 31, 2022. Interest will be payable on amounts outstanding under the facility at a floating trade refinance rate quoted by NAB plus 1.5% at the time of each drawdown. The facility is secured by a fixed and floating lien over all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of Pasture Genetics. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $10.0 million (USD $6,849,000) was outstanding under Pasture Genetics' working capital facility with NAB. \n \u2022 Pasture Genetics finances certain vehicle purchases with TOYOTA Finance. This facility has various maturity dates through 2023 and have interest rates ranging from 4.04% to 5.83%. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $750,839 (USD $514,249) was outstanding under TOYOTA Finance facility. \nPasture Genetics was in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2020.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nOn April 14, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $1,958,600, or the Loan, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA. If the loan proceeds are fully utilized to pay qualified expenses, the full principal amount of the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan, along with any accrued interest, may qualify for loan forgiveness, subject to potential reduction based on the level of full-time employees maintained by the organization.\nWhen we applied for the loan, we believed we would qualify to have the loan forgiven under the terms of PPP, and therefore considered the loan to be substantively a conditional government grant. We have performed initial calculations for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect that the PPP loan will be forgiven in full because 1) we have, prior\nto June 30, 2020, utilized all of the proceeds for payroll and other qualified expenses and 2) we believe we will continue to comply with other terms and conditions necessary for forgiveness.\nWe plan to submit the PPP loan forgiveness application in the near term. Although we believe it is probable that the PPP loan will be forgiven, our actions and information must be evaluated by the lender and SBA before forgiveness is formally granted.\nEquity Issuances\nIn September 2018, we sold 1,607,717 shares of our common stock to MFP at a purchase price of $3.11 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $5.0 million.\nIn October 2018, we issued to MFP 7,235 shares of a newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $3,110 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million. The preferred shares carried no voting rights and were automatically convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1,000 shares of common stock per preferred share upon the approval of our stockholders for the issuance of the requisite shares of common stock. Pursuant to the purchase agreement for the preferred shares, we agreed to use reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of our shareholders for the issuance of stock upon the conversion of the preferred shares. Approval was obtained in November 2018 and the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted into 7,235,000 shares of our common stock.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,763,627\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,295,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,286,370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26,566,353\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,049,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,630,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (308,410\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (250,073\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash\nequivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 691,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (889,092\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,431,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,320,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,123,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,431,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, operating activities used $5.8 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $11.0 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $5.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in inventory of $11.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.9 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, operating activities provided $21.3 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $24.5 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $3.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in inventory of $13.3 million, offset by increases in deferred revenue of $8.1 million related to the Corteva license agreement and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 used $10.3 million in cash. The Dow Wheat Acquisition accounted for $2.6 million of the cash used in investing activities and the Pasture Genetics Acquisition accounted for $7.5 million. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $2.0 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our distribution facility in Keith, Australia, research and development facilities in Tamworth, Australia and leasehold improvements to our new corporate headquarters in Longmont, Colorado; partially offset by $1.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of properties in Arlington Wisconsin and Plainview Texas.\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 used $26.6 million in cash. The Chromatin Acquisition accounted for $26.4 million of the cash used in investing activities. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $0.7 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our facility in Keith, Australia and replacements of our vehicle fleet in the US.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 provided $17.0 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we had net borrowings on the working capital lines of credit of $16.8 million, borrowings of long-term debt of $3.9 million and repayments of long-term debt of $2.6 million and debt issuance costs of $0.9 million.\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 provided $4.6 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we completed a private placement of common stock which raised net proceeds of $4.9 million in cash and a private placement of preferred stock which raised net proceeds of $22.4 million. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we also had net repayments on the working capital lines of credit of $21.3 million. On August 15, 2018, we closed on a sale and leaseback transaction involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold the equipment for $2.1 million in proceeds.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including our revenue and income from continuing operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 the extent and duration of future operating income; \n \u2022 the level and timing of future sales and expenditures; \n \u2022 working capital required to support our growth; \n \u2022 investment capital for plant and equipment; \n \u2022 our sales and marketing programs; \n \u2022 investment capital for potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms; \n \u2022 competition; and \n \u2022 market developments. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates are set forth in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, we must select and apply various accounting policies. Our most significant policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. In order to apply our accounting policies, we often need to make estimates based on judgments about future events. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. However, the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our results of operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition may be materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or to take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition. Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with the audit committee of our board of directors, and do so on a regular basis.\nWe believe that the following estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments. In addition, had we used estimates different from any of these, our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition for the current period could have been materially different from those presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit. We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04, effective July 1, 2018. This standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, we perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its one reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe goodwill balance at June 30, 2020 relates to our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics. Upon completing the impairment test on its one reporting unit, there was no impairment for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we terminated our production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, thereby triggering a potential indicator of goodwill impairment. As a result, we initiated a goodwill impairment test for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nWe compared the carrying value of our invested capital to estimated fair values at June 30, 2019. We estimated the fair value based on the income approach. The discounted cash flows served as the primary basis for the income approach and were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation. The income approach valuation included estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.6%.\nUpon completing the impairment test, we determined that the fair value of invested capital was less than the carrying value by approximately 10%, thus indicating an impairment. We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which represented the entire goodwill balance prior to the impairment charge.\nIntangible Assets\nAll amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible. If the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset, the carrying amount of the intangible is compared to its fair value, with an impairment loss recognized if the fair value is below carrying value. Fair values are typically estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Significant changes in key assumptions about the business, market conditions and prospects for which the intangible asset is currently utilized or expected to be utilized could result in an impairment charge.\nIn conjunction with the termination of the Pioneer production and distribution agreements, we recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge of intangible assets related to the Pioneer distribution agreements for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services. Under such provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, under the straight-line method, over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant).\nWe account for equity instruments, including stock options issued to non-employees, in accordance with authoritative guidance for equity-based payments to non-employees (FASB ASC 505-50). Stock options issued to non-employees are accounted for at their estimated fair value. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is re-measured as they vest.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under share-based compensation plans. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires us to estimate a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the expected term of the award, stock price volatility, dividend rate, risk-free interest rate. The input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. The expected term used represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding. We have used the historical volatility for our stock for the expected volatility assumption required in the model, as it is more representative of future stock price trends. We use a risk-free interest rate that is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issued with an equivalent remaining term at the time of grant. We have not paid dividends in the past and currently do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, and as such, dividend yield is assumed to be zero for the purposes of valuing the stock options granted. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change, and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. When there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees, our share-based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants.\nIncome Taxes\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent management believes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, an income tax charge is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. If the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated, we would be required to write-off the\nremaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision, resulting in a reduction of earnings and stockholders' equity.\nInventories\nAll inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods. Depending on market conditions, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. The factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans and expected market conditions. We perform a review of our inventory by product line on a quarterly basis.\nOur subsidiary, S&W Australia, does not fix the final price for seed payable to its growers until the completion of a given year's sales cycle pursuant to its standard contract production agreement. We record an estimated unit price accordingly, inventory, cost of revenue and gross profits are based upon management's best estimate of the final purchase price to our S&W Australia growers. To the extent the estimated purchase price varies from the final purchase price for seed, the adjustment to actual could materially impact the results in the period when the difference between estimates and actuals are identified. If the actual purchase price is in excess of our estimated purchase price, this would negatively impact our financial results including a reduction in gross profits and earnings.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $8.8 million, which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. $4.8 million of this write-down related to dormant alfalfa seed products. The termination of the distribution and production agreements with Pioneer altered our planned consumption of these varieties and as a result we determined this particular dormant seed inventory will need to be sold to alternative sales channels at lower selling prices. The remaining inventory write-down primarily relates to changes in our assessment of the future market prices for non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties. The changes in our assessment occurred as we updated our business plans taking into account activity during the fourth quarter, which is the height of the sales season for non-dormant varieties.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $2.3 million which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The write-down of inventory during the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to certain inventory lots that deteriorated in quality and germination rates during the year.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe regularly assess the collectability of receivables and provide an allowance for doubtful trade receivables equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. That estimate is based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as referred to on page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a global multi-crop, middle-market agricultural company. We are market leaders in the breeding, production and sale of alfalfa seed and sorghum seed. We also have a growing commercial market presence in sunflower, wheat and pasture seed and maintain an active stevia development program.\nOur seed platform develops and supplies high quality germplasm designed to produce higher yields for farmers worldwide. We sell over 500 seed products in more than 40 countries. We maintain an active product pipeline and expect to introduce more than 25 new products during the 2021-2022 fiscal years.\nFounded in 1980, we began our operations as a limited producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties bred for warm climates and high-yields, including varieties that can thrive in poor, saline soils. Over the years we have built a diversified, global agricultural platform through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions and collaborations, including:\n \u2022 Our 2012 acquisition of Imperial Valley Seeds, Inc., which enabled us to expand production of non-GMO alfalfa seed into California's Imperial Valley, thereby ensuring a non-GMO uncontaminated source of alfalfa seed due to the prohibition on growing GMO crops in the Imperial Valley, as well as enabling us to diversify our production areas and distribution channels; \n \u2022 Our 2012 acquisition of a portfolio of dormant alfalfa germplasm, which launched our entry into the dormant alfalfa market; \n \u2022 Our 2013 acquisition of Seed Genetics International Pty Ltd (now S&W Seed Company Australia Pty Ltd, or S&W Australia), the leading producer of non-dormant alfalfa seed in South Australia, which made us the largest non-dormant alfalfa seed company in the world, with production capabilities in both hemispheres; \n \u2022 Our 2014 acquisition of alfalfa production and research facility assets and conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa germplasm from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., or Pioneer (now a subsidiary of Corteva Agriscience, Inc., or Corteva), which substantially broadened and improved our dormant alfalfa germplasm portfolio and deepened our production, research and product development capabilities; \n \u2022 Our 2016 acquisition of the business and assets of SV Genetics Pty Ltd, a developer of proprietary hybrid sorghum and sunflower seed germplasm, which expanded our crop focus into two areas which we believe have high global growth potential; \n \u2022 Our 2018 acquisition of the assets of Chromatin, Inc. and related companies, which positioned us to become a global leader in the hybrid sorghum seed market and enhanced our distribution channels both internationally and within a U.S.-based farmer-dealer network; \n \u2022 Our 2018 joint venture with AGT Foods Africa Proprietary Limited and 2019 joint venture with Zaad Holdings Limited, both based in South Africa, each of which were formed to produce our hybrid sunflower, grain sorghum and forage sorghum seed in Africa for sale in Africa, the Middle East and Europe; \n \u2022 Our May 2019 restructuring of our relationship with Pioneer, a subsidiary of Corteva, which we jointly refer to as Corteva, under which, among other things: \n o We received $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.55 million in September 2019, $5.55 million in January 2020, $5.55 million in February 2020, $3.75 million in September 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $4.6 million in additional payments on the dates and in the amounts as set forth below. \n\n o Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed varieties include certain of our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and six pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties. Corteva received no license to our other commercial alfalfa varieties or pre-commercial alfalfa pipeline products and no rights to any future products developed by us. \n o We assigned to Corteva grower production contract rights, and Corteva assumed grower production contract obligations, related to the licensed and certain other alfalfa varieties. \n o Our prior Distribution Agreement, related to conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties, and Contract Alfalfa Production Services Agreement, related to GMO-traited alfalfa varieties, with Corteva both terminated. Under the Distribution Agreement, Corteva was obligated to make minimum annual purchases from us. \n \u2022 Our 2019 license of commercialized and developmental wheat germplasm from Corteva, through which we entered the largest grain crop market in Australia; \n \u2022 Our 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics Ltd., or Pasture Genetics, the third largest pasture seed company in Australia, which further diversified our product offerings in Australia and strengthened our Australian sales team and distribution relationships; \n \u2022 Our 2020 collaboration with ADAMA Ltd., or ADAMA, a subsidiary of China National Chemical Engineering Co Ltd., or ChemChina, to bring to the U.S. sorghum market the DoubleTeamTM grassy weed management system, consisting of ADAMA's proprietary herbicides and our non-GMO, herbicide tolerant sorghum hybrids; and \n \u2022 Our 2020 licensing agreement with The Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association, Inc., an affiliate of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, to develop and commercialize worldwide a non-GMO, dhurrin-free trait in sorghum species, which essentially eliminates potential livestock death from hydrogen cyanide poisoning when grazing sorghum \nAs a result of the 2018 Chromatin acquisition, the 2019 restructuring of our relationship with Corteva and our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, we expect that our results of operations for fiscal 2021 and future periods will differ significantly from prior periods as the mix of our product portfolio rebalances away from a reliance on alfalfa sales (sales of alfalfa seed to Corteva totaled $19.7 million and $37.6 million during the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively) to a more diverse product mix. We expect to generate alfalfa seed revenue of approximately $15 million from Corteva over the fiscal 2021 period as the seed is delivered to Corteva through February 2021. We do not expect any other significant revenue from sales to Corteva in the future.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and have implemented measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a voluntary work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. We are continuing our activities and are taking precautionary measures to protect our employees working in our facilities.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak could have a negative impact on our sales, operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales, operating results and financial condition will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn particular, our sales cycle is highly seasonal, and the majority of our sales season activities for the United States and Australia are typically concentrated between March and June of each year. Our sales efforts also have historically involved significant in-person interaction with potential customers and distributors. In March 2020, at the beginning of what is typically our most active selling period, many national, state and local governments in our target markets implemented various stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and other quarantine measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we immediately attempted to shift our sales activities to video conferencing and similar customer interaction models, but we have found these alternative approaches to generally be less effective than in-person sales efforts.\nIn addition, our product revenue is predicated on our ability to timely fulfill customer orders, which depends in large part upon the consistent availability and operation of shipping and distribution networks operated by third parties. Farmers typically have a limited window during which they can plant seed, and their buying decisions can be shaped by actual or perceived disruptions in our distribution and supply channels. If our customers delay or decrease their orders due to potential disruptions in our distribution and supply channels, this would adversely affect our product revenue.\nGiven these uncertainties, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nComponents of Our Statements of Operations Data\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nProduct and Other Revenue\nWe derive most of our revenue from the sale of our proprietary seed varieties and hybrids. We expect that over the next several years, a substantial majority of our revenue will be generated from the sale of alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower and pasture seed, although we are continually assessing other possible product offerings or means to increase revenue, including expanding into other, higher margin crops.\nThe mix of our product offerings will continue to change over time with the introduction of new seed varieties and hybrids resulting from our robust research and development efforts, including our potential expansion into gene-edited products in future periods.\nOur revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of orders from our customers and distributors. Because some of our large customers and distributors order in bulk only one or two times per year, our product revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period. However, some of this fluctuation is offset by having operations in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\nOur stevia breeding program has yet to generate any meaningful revenue. However, management continues to evaluate this portion of our business and assess various means to monetize the results of our effort to breed new, better tasting stevia varieties. Such potential opportunities include possible licensing agreements and royalty-based agreements.\nLicensing Revenue\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2019, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of the our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and six pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue relates to sale of our seed products and consists of the cost of procuring seed, plant conditioning and packaging costs, direct labor and raw materials and overhead costs.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery, development, breeding and testing of new products incorporating the traits we have specifically selected. These expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits, consultant services, land leased for field trials, chemicals and supplies and other external expenses.\nOverall, we have been focused on controlling research and development expenses, while balancing that objective against the recognition that continued advancement in product development is an important part of our strategic planning. We intend to focus our resources on high value activities. For alfalfa seed, we plan to invest in further development of differentiating forage quality traits. For sorghum, we plan to invest in higher value grain products, proprietary herbicide tolerance traits and improved safety and palatability in forage products. We expect our research and development expenses will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of various research and development projects.\nOur internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred, while third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. The costs associated with equipment or facilities acquired or construed for research and development activities that have alternative future uses are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee costs, including salaries, employee benefits and share-based compensation, as well as professional service fees, insurance, marketing, travel and entertainment expense, public company expense and other overhead costs. We proactively take steps on an ongoing basis to control selling, general and administrative expense as much as is reasonably possible.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets, including those acquired from Pasture Genetics in 2020, Chromatin in 2018 and from SV Genetics in May 2016, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 10-30 years for technology/IP/germplasm, 5-20 years for customer relationships and trade names and 3-20 years for other intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful life of the asset, consisting of periods of 5-35 years for buildings, 2-20 years for machinery and equipment and 2-5 years for vehicles.\nOther (Income) Expense\nOther expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, change in contingent consideration obligation, government grant income, changes in the estimated fair value of assets held for sale and interest expense in connection with amortization of debt discount. Interest expense primarily consists of interest costs related to outstanding borrowings on our working capital credit facilities and our financing with Conterra Agricultural Capital, LLC, or Conterra.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates, differences in the deductibility of certain expenses and inclusion of certain income items between financial statement and tax return purposes, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. Tax regulations require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when those items are required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, our effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as meals and entertainment expenses that are not fully deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets. The full valuation allowance was recorded during the fiscal year 2017 as a result of changes to our operating results and future projections, resulting from a decline in export sales to Saudi Arabia. As a result, we don't believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nRevenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $79.6 million compared to $109.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $30.1 million decrease in revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to a $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue received from Pioneer. In May 2019, we terminated the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, and entered into a new license agreement with Corteva.\nAs part of the termination, Corteva agreed to purchase certain quantities of seed held by us as of the date of the termination, which Pioneer was not previously obligated to purchase. Those quantities of seed will be delivered to Corteva periodically through February 2021. Contemporaneously with the termination, we entered into a license with Corteva, under which Corteva received a fully pre-paid, exclusive license to produce and distribute certain of our alfalfa seed varieties world-wide (except South America). The licensed seed varieties include certain of our existing commercial conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa varieties and nine pre-commercial dormant alfalfa varieties. We received a payment of $45.0 million in May 2019, $5.6 million in September 2019, $5.6 million in January 2020, $5.6 million in February 2020 and are entitled to receive an aggregate of $8.4 million in additional payments through February 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2020 we recorded product sales of $19.7 million to Pioneer, which was a decrease of $18.0 million from the year ended June 30, 2019 amount of $37.6 million. Additionally, we recorded one-time license revenue of $34.2 million from Pioneer in the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe $52.1 million decrease in product and license revenue to Pioneer was partially offset by an increase of $21.9 million in Core Revenue. Core Revenue (excluding product and license revenue attributable to Pioneer) for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $59.9 million compared to Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $37.9\nmillion, representing an increase of 58%. Included in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $11.8 million of revenue pertaining to a partial period contribution from our acquisition of Pasture Genetics which occurred on February 24, 2020. Excluding contributions from Pasture Genetics, Core Revenue growth was 27%. Due to the revised agreements entered into with Pioneer in May 2019, we plan to provide Core Revenue as a metric to track performance of our business.\nThe increase in Core Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 can be attributed to an increase in alfalfa in Saudi Arabia and sorghum sales in the United States as well as growth in Pakistan, Europe and South Africa.\nSales into international markets represented 54% and 20% of our total revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Domestic revenue accounted for 46% and 80% of our total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to the termination of the Pioneer and Corteva agreement mentioned above and our recent Pasture Genetics acquisition. We anticipate that international sales as a percentage of our total revenue will increase for fiscal 2021 as a result of the acquisition of Pasture Genetics and our expanded Australian market footprint.\nThe following table shows revenue from external sources by destination country:\n\nCost of revenue of $64.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 was equal to 81.2% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020, while the cost of revenue of $69.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 was equal to 62.9% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019. Cost of revenue increased on a percentage basis primarily due to the license revenue generated during the year ended June 30, 2019, which did not recur during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nTotal gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was 18.8% compared to 37.1% in the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the decrease in license revenue. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 included a $2.3 million inventory write-down. Gross profit margin for the year ended June 30, 2019 included one-time license revenue of $34.2 million and an inventory write-down of $8.8 million.\nExcluding the $2.3 million of inventory write-downs, gross margin would have been 21.7% for the year ended June 30, 2020. Excluding the $8.8 million of inventory write-downs and the $34.2 million of license revenue, gross margin would have been 20.3% for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in adjusted gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily driven by improved gross margins in alfalfa. We believe its useful to exclude inventory write-downs and one-time license revenue in calculating adjusted gross margins in order to provide investors with a method to compare our operating results to prior periods and to peer companies.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative, or SG&A expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $21.3 million compared to $17.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $3.9 million increase in SG&A expense versus the prior year was primarily due to $3.2 million of additional investment in sales and marketing, $1.2 million from our newly acquired Pasture Genetics operations, $0.7 million for management personnel, $0.5 million for stock based compensation, $0.5 million for IT and cyber security consulting, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.3 million and other decreases. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 26.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to 15.9% for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $7.3 million compared to $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $1.0 million increase in research and development expense versus the prior year is driven by additional research and development activities incurred in connection with the Chromatin business following our October 2018 acquisition, as well as additional investment in our hybrid sorghum and sunflower programs and wheat program in Australia.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $5.0 million compared to $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Included in the amount was amortization expense for intangible assets, which totaled $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 and $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The $0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense over the prior year is primarily driven by $0.4 million of additional Chromatin expenses following the October 2018 acquisition, $0.2 million of expense associated with our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics, $0.3 million of expense associated with amortization of right of use assets and $0.2 million of additional expenses following the Dow Wheat Acquisition in August 2019, partially offset by fully depreciated assets.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $11.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 related to the full impairment of our goodwill and was a result of the termination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer/Corteva.\nThe termination of the production and distribution agreements with Pioneer was, in our view, a potential indicator of impairment due to the significant reduction in future forecasted revenues. As a result, we initiated an impairment test and concluded that the entire goodwill balance was impaired.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we did not record an impairment charge. We recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2019. The impairment charge in fiscal 2019 was a result of the\ntermination of the distribution agreement with Pioneer. The intangible asset write-off related to the carrying value of the distribution agreement, which previously was being amortized over the contractual life of the agreement.\nChange in Estimated Value of Assets Held for Sale\nThe Company recorded $0.1 million and $1.5 of expenses for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The expense related to our estimated change in value of certain properties held for sale.\nChange in contingent consideration obligation\nThe contingent consideration obligation is considered a level 3 fair value financial instrument and will be measured at each reporting period. The $0.3 million benefit to non-cash change in contingent consideration obligation for the year ended June 30, 2020 represents the decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation associated with the February 2020 Pasture Genetics acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Amortization of Debt Discount\nNon-cash amortization of debt discount expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $0.6 million compared to $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The expense in both years represents the amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our working capital facilities, our secured property note and our equipment finance leases.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $2.0 million compared to $2.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with CIBC, KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily consisted of interest incurred on the working capital credit facilities with KeyBank and NAB, the secured property loan entered into in November 2017, and equipment finance leases. The $0.9 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily driven by lower interest on the working capital credit facilities and decreased levels of borrowings.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense totaled $0.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was (2.0%) for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to 1.6% for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our effective tax rate was relatively consistent year over year. The slight decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in our non-US income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Previously, we had certain intangible assets with indefinite lives for financial reporting purposes which produced deferred tax liabilities that could not be offset by a valuation allowance. During fiscal year 2019, we wrote down a majority of these assets for financial reporting purposes, generating a net deferred tax asset balance with respect to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, which is now fully offset by our valuation allowance. The increase to the valuation allowance in fiscal year 2019 generated a tax benefit and a positive effective tax rate, as opposed to the previous year when the increase in our net deferred tax liability balance produced an income tax provision and a negative effective tax rate. Due to the valuation allowance, we do not record the income tax expense or benefit related to substantially all of our current year operating results, as such results are generally incorporated in our net operating loss deferred tax asset position, which has a full valuation allowance against it. However, we did record tax expense related to certain other items occurring throughout the year. For example, we recorded income tax expense related to the current and prior year tax return filings of certain of our subsidiaries located in Australia and South Africa and also recorded tax expense related to current year state tax return liabilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital and working capital requirements fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the phase of the growing and sales cycle that falls during a particular quarter. Our need for cash has historically been highest in the second and third fiscal quarters (October through March) because we historically have paid our North American contracted growers progressively, starting in the second fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2020, we paid our North American growers approximately 50% of amounts due in the fall of 2019 and the balance was paid in the spring of 2020. This payment cycle to our growers was similar in fiscal year 2019, and we expect it to be similar for fiscal year 2021. S&W Australia and Pasture Genetics, our Australian-based subsidiaries, have production cycles that are counter-cyclical to North America; however, this also puts a greater demand on our working capital and working capital requirements during the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters based on timing of payments to growers in the second through fourth quarters.\nHistorically, due to the concentration of sales to certain distributors, our month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter sales and associated cash receipts are highly dependent upon the timing of deliveries to and payments from these distributors, which varies significantly from year to year.\nWe continuously monitor and evaluate our credit policies with all of our customers based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of the respective trade accounts receivable balance. Our principal working capital components include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payable and our working capital lines of credit.\nOn February 24, 2020, S&W Australia acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pasture Genetics, the PG Acquisition, for an initial consideration that consisted of an upfront cash payment at closing of USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). A potential earn-out payment of up to USD $5.3 million (AUD $8.0 million), or the Earn-Out, is payable on September 30, 2022, or the Earn-Out Date. The amount of any Earn-Out will be equal to the excess, if any, of (a) 7.5, multiplied by the average of an agreed-upon calculation of Pasture Genetics' earnings over fiscal years 2021 and 2022, above (b) USD $7.5 million (AUD $11.4 million). At S&W Australia's election, up to 50% of the Earn-Out may be paid in shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price equal to the volume-weighted average purchase price of our common stock during the 10-day period ending immediately prior to the Earn-Out Date.\nIn addition to funding our business with cash from operations, we have historically relied upon occasional sales of our debt and equity securities and credit facilities from financial institutions, both in the United States and South Australia.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 the extent and duration of future operating income; \n \u2022 the level and timing of future sales and expenditures; \n \u2022 working capital required to support our growth; \n \u2022 investment capital for plant and equipment; \n \u2022 our sales and marketing programs; \n \u2022 investment capital for potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms; \n \u2022 competition; \n \u2022 market developments; and \n \u2022 developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. It is possible that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will occur. If equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may affect our ability to raise equity capital, borrow on our existing facilities or make any additional necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain, more costly and/or more dilutive. In addition, while we are currently in compliance with our loan agreements, the COVID-19 pandemic may compromise our ability to comply with the terms of our loan agreements and could result in an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, our lenders could accelerate our repayment obligations or enforce their other rights under our agreements with them. Any such default may also require us to seek additional or alternative financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn recent periods, we have consummated the following equity and debt financings:\nDebt Financings\nLoan and Security Agreement with CIBC\nOn December 26, 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with CIBC, or the Loan Agreement, which we amended on September 22, 2020. As amended, the Loan Agreement provides for a $25.0 million credit facility, or the CIBC Credit Facility. The key terms of the amended Loan Agreement include the following:\n \u2022 Advances under the CIBC Credit Facility are to be used: (i) to refinance indebtedness to KeyBank, discussed below; (ii) to finance our ongoing working capital requirements; and (iii) for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the CIBC Credit Facility to finance permitted acquisitions and related costs. \n \u2022 All amounts due and owing, including, but not limited to, accrued and unpaid principal and interest due under the CIBC Credit Facility, will be payable in full on December 23, 2022. \n \u2022 The Credit Facility generally establishes a borrowing base of up to 85% of eligible domestic accounts receivable (90% of eligible foreign accounts receivable) plus up to the lesser of (i) 65% of eligible inventory, (ii) 85% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory, and (iii) an eligible inventory sublimit as more fully set forth in the Loan Agreement, in each case, subject to lender reserves. \n \u2022 Loans may be based on (i) a Base Rate plus 1.0% per annum or (ii) LIBOR Rate plus 3.0% per annum (both as defined in the Loan Agreement), generally at our option. In the event of a default, at the option of CIBC, the interest rate on all obligations owing will increase by 2% per annum over the rate otherwise applicable. \n \u2022 The CIBC Credit Facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets (subject to certain exceptions), including intellectual property. \n \u2022 The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default that permit CIBC to accelerate our outstanding obligations \n under the Credit Facility, all as set forth in the Loan Agreement and related documents. The CIBC Credit Facility also contains customary and usual financial covenants imposed by CIBC. \nAs of June 30, 2020, we were not in compliance with a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.10 to 1.00, tested as of June 30, 2020. Pursuant to the September 2020 amendment to the Loan Agreement, CIBC waived the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2020, and agreed to suspend its applicability prospectively until the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021, we must maintain a fixed charge coverage equal to or greater than 1.15 to 1.00. Commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2020, through and including December 31, 2020, the amendment provides that we must comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain year-to-date EBITDA (as calculated in the Loan Agreement) of no less than negative $6,000,000, tested quarterly. This covenant will not apply for periods after December 31, 2020.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with our covenants in the Loan Agreement in the future, or secure additional waivers if or when required. If we are unable to comply with or obtain a waiver of any noncompliance under the Loan Agreement, CIBC could declare an event of default or require us to further renegotiate the Loan Agreement on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us, or we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing. If we were to seek additional or alternative financing, any such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any declaration by CIBC of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nTermination of KeyBank Credit Facility\nIn connection with the consummation of the Loan Agreement with CIBC described above, we terminated the Credit and Security Agreement, dated September 22, 2015, as subsequently amended, with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank. In connection with such termination, we paid KeyBank approximately $5.9 million in aggregate principal, interest and fees that were outstanding and payable under this agreement at the time of its termination, and all liens on our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries guaranteeing such facility, together with such subsidiary guarantees, were released and terminated. This agreement had provided for borrowings of up to a $45.0 million revolving line of credit.\nConterra Transaction\nIn November 2017, we entered into a secured note financing transaction with Conterra for $12.5 million in gross proceeds. In the transaction, we issued two secured promissory notes to Conterra. The first promissory note, in the principal amount of $10.4 million, or the Secured Real Estate Note is secured by a first priority security interest in the property, plant and fixtures located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities and our Nampa, Idaho research facilities. The note was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2020, which was extended to November 30, 2022 pursuant to a December 24, 2019 amendment. The note bears interest of 7.75% per annum. We have agreed to make (i) a principal and interest payment of approximately $515,711 on January 1, 2020; (ii) five consecutive semi-annual principal and interest payments of approximately $454,185, beginning on July 1, 2020; and (iii) a one-time final payment of approximately $8,957,095 on November 30, 2022. The second promissory note in the principal amount of $2.1 million, was secured by a first security interest in certain equipment not attached to the real estate located at the facilities noted above. In August 2018 we paid off in full this note pursuant to the sale-leaseback transaction discussed below.\nWe may prepay the note, in whole or in part, at any time.\nEquipment Sale-Leaseback\nIn August 2018, we closed on a sale-leaseback transaction with American AgCredit involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the sale-leaseback transaction:\n \u2022 We sold the equipment to American AgCredit for $2.1 million in proceeds. The proceeds were used to pay off in full the Conterra promissory note mentioned above. \n \u2022 We entered into a lease agreement with American AgCredit relating to the equipment. The lease agreement has a five-year term and provides for monthly lease payments of $40,023 (representing an annual interest rate of 5.6%). At the end of the lease term, we will repurchase the equipment for $1. \nAustralian Facilities\nS&W Australia and Pasture Genetics both have debt facilities with NAB, all of which are guaranteed by us up to a maximum of AUD $15,000,000 (USD $10,273,500 at June 30, 2020) and cross-guaranteed by S&W Australia and Pasture Genetics.\nS&W Australia. S&W Australia has a series of debt facilities with NAB providing for up to AUD $25,337,000 (USD $17,353,000) of credit, the key terms of which were amended in February 2020 (in connection with the Pasture Genetics acquisition) and include the following:\n \u2022 S&W Australia finances the purchase of most of its seed inventory from growers pursuant to a seasonal credit facility comprised of two facility lines: (i) an overdraft line having a credit limit of AUD $2,000,000 (USD $1,369,800 at June 30, 2020) and (ii) a borrowing base line having a credit limit of AUD $16,000,000 (USD $10,958,400 at June 30, 2020). The seasonal credit facility expires on March 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2020, the Borrowing Base Line accrued interest on Australian dollar drawings at approximately 3.7% per annum calculated daily. The Overdraft Facility permits S&W Australia to borrow funds on a revolving line of credit up to the credit limit. Interest accrues daily and is calculated by applying the daily interest rate to the balance owing at the end of the day and is payable monthly in arrears. As of June 30, 2020, the Overdraft Facility accrued interest at approximately 5.47% per annum calculated daily. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $14,000,000 (USD $9,588,600) was outstanding under S&W Australia's seasonal credit facility with NAB. The seasonal credit facility is secured by a fixed and floating lien over all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of S&W Australia. S&W Australia was in compliance with all debt covenants under the seasonal credit facility at June 30, 2020. \n \u2022 S&W Australia has a flexible rate loan, or the Term Loan, in the amount of AUD $5.0 million (USD $3,424,500 at June 30, 2020). Required annual principal payments of AUD $500,000 on the Term Loan will commence on November 30, 2020, with the remainder of any unpaid balance becoming due on March 31, 2025. Monthly interest amounts outstanding under the Term Loan will be payable in arrears at a floating rate quoted by NAB for the applicable pricing period, plus 2.6%. The Term Loan is secured by a lien on all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of S&W Australia. \n \u2022 S&W Australia finances certain equipment purchases under a master asset finance facility with NAB. The master asset finance facility has various maturity dates through 2023 and have interest rates ranging from 3.47% to 5.31%. The credit limit under the facility is AUD $2,000,000 (USD $1,369,800) at June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $839,869 (USD $575,226) was outstanding under S&W Australia's master asset finance facility. \n \u2022 S&W Australia has a Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility for the machinery and equipment used in the operations of the Keith building. The Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility bears interest, payable in arrears, based on the Australian Trade Refinance Rate quoted by NAB at the time of the drawdown, plus 2.9%. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $137,503 (USD $94,176) was outstanding under the Keith Machinery and Equipment Facility. \nS&W Australia was in compliance with all debt covenants under its debt facilities with NAB at June 30, 2020.\nPasture Genetics. Pasture Genetics has a working capital facility with NAB and a facility with TOYOTA Finance to finance purchase of vehicles.\n \u2022 Pasture Genetics has a working capital facility with NAB with a credit limit of AUD $10.0 million (USD $6,849,000 at June 30, 2020) and a borrowing base determined from qualified inventory and accounts receivable. The facility will expire on March 31, 2022. Interest will be payable on amounts outstanding under the facility at a floating trade refinance rate quoted by NAB plus 1.5% at the time of each drawdown. The facility is secured by a fixed and floating lien over all the present and future rights, property and undertakings of Pasture Genetics. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $10.0 million (USD $6,849,000) was outstanding under Pasture Genetics' working capital facility with NAB. \n \u2022 Pasture Genetics finances certain vehicle purchases with TOYOTA Finance. This facility has various maturity dates through 2023 and have interest rates ranging from 4.04% to 5.83%. As of June 30, 2020, AUD $750,839 (USD $514,249) was outstanding under TOYOTA Finance facility. \nPasture Genetics was in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2020.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nOn April 14, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $1,958,600, or the Loan, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA. If the loan proceeds are fully utilized to pay qualified expenses, the full principal amount of the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, loan, along with any accrued interest, may qualify for loan forgiveness, subject to potential reduction based on the level of full-time employees maintained by the organization.\nWhen we applied for the loan, we believed we would qualify to have the loan forgiven under the terms of PPP, and therefore considered the loan to be substantively a conditional government grant. We have performed initial calculations for PPP loan forgiveness, and expect that the PPP loan will be forgiven in full because 1) we have, prior\nto June 30, 2020, utilized all of the proceeds for payroll and other qualified expenses and 2) we believe we will continue to comply with other terms and conditions necessary for forgiveness.\nWe plan to submit the PPP loan forgiveness application in the near term. Although we believe it is probable that the PPP loan will be forgiven, our actions and information must be evaluated by the lender and SBA before forgiveness is formally granted.\nEquity Issuances\nIn September 2018, we sold 1,607,717 shares of our common stock to MFP at a purchase price of $3.11 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $5.0 million.\nIn October 2018, we issued to MFP 7,235 shares of a newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $3,110 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $22.5 million. The preferred shares carried no voting rights and were automatically convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of 1,000 shares of common stock per preferred share upon the approval of our stockholders for the issuance of the requisite shares of common stock. Pursuant to the purchase agreement for the preferred shares, we agreed to use reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of our shareholders for the issuance of stock upon the conversion of the preferred shares. Approval was obtained in November 2018 and the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted into 7,235,000 shares of our common stock.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019:\n\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, operating activities used $5.8 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $11.0 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $5.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in inventory of $11.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $2.9 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.9 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $1.8 million.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2019, operating activities provided $21.3 million in cash. Net loss plus and minus the adjustments for non-cash items as detailed on the statement of cash flows provided $24.5 million in cash, and changes in operating assets and liabilities as detailed on the statement of cash flows used $3.2 million in cash. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in inventory of $13.3 million, offset by increases in deferred revenue of $8.1 million related to the Corteva license agreement and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $3.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 used $10.3 million in cash. The Dow Wheat Acquisition accounted for $2.6 million of the cash used in investing activities and the Pasture Genetics Acquisition accounted for $7.5 million. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $2.0 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our distribution facility in Keith, Australia, research and development facilities in Tamworth, Australia and leasehold improvements to our new corporate headquarters in Longmont, Colorado; partially offset by $1.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of properties in Arlington Wisconsin and Plainview Texas.\nInvesting activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 used $26.6 million in cash. The Chromatin Acquisition accounted for $26.4 million of the cash used in investing activities. We also had additions to property, plant and equipment of $0.7 million consisting primarily of equipment purchases for our facility in Keith, Australia and replacements of our vehicle fleet in the US.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2020 provided $17.0 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we had net borrowings on the working capital lines of credit of $16.8 million, borrowings of long-term debt of $3.9 million and repayments of long-term debt of $2.6 million and debt issuance costs of $0.9 million.\nFinancing activities during the year ended June 30, 2019 provided $4.6 million in cash. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we completed a private placement of common stock which raised net proceeds of $4.9 million in cash and a private placement of preferred stock which raised net proceeds of $22.4 million. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we also had net repayments on the working capital lines of credit of $21.3 million. On August 15, 2018, we closed on a sale and leaseback transaction involving certain equipment located at our Five Points, California and Nampa, Idaho production facilities. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold the equipment for $2.1 million in proceeds.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including our revenue and income from continuing operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:\n \u2022 the extent and duration of future operating income; \n \u2022 the level and timing of future sales and expenditures; \n \u2022 working capital required to support our growth; \n \u2022 investment capital for plant and equipment; \n \u2022 our sales and marketing programs; \n \u2022 investment capital for potential acquisitions; \n \u2022 our ability to renew and/or refinance our debt on acceptable terms; \n \u2022 competition; and \n \u2022 market developments. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates are set forth in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, we must select and apply various accounting policies. Our most significant policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. In order to apply our accounting policies, we often need to make estimates based on judgments about future events. In making such estimates, we rely on historical experience, market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. However, the estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our results of operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition may be materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or to take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition. Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with the audit committee of our board of directors, and do so on a regular basis.\nWe believe that the following estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments. In addition, had we used estimates different from any of these, our results of operations, financial condition or changes in financial condition for the current period could have been materially different from those presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit. We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU 2017-04, effective July 1, 2018. This standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, we perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of its one reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe goodwill balance at June 30, 2020 relates to our February 2020 acquisition of Pasture Genetics. Upon completing the impairment test on its one reporting unit, there was no impairment for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we terminated our production and distribution agreements with Pioneer, thereby triggering a potential indicator of goodwill impairment. As a result, we initiated a goodwill impairment test for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nWe compared the carrying value of our invested capital to estimated fair values at June 30, 2019. We estimated the fair value based on the income approach. The discounted cash flows served as the primary basis for the income approach and were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of ten years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation. The income approach valuation included estimated weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.6%.\nUpon completing the impairment test, we determined that the fair value of invested capital was less than the carrying value by approximately 10%, thus indicating an impairment. We recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $11.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which represented the entire goodwill balance prior to the impairment charge.\nIntangible Assets\nAll amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events indicate a possible loss. Such an assessment involves estimating undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the intangible. If the review indicates that undiscounted cash flows are less than the recorded value of the intangible asset, the carrying amount of the intangible is compared to its fair value, with an impairment loss recognized if the fair value is below carrying value. Fair values are typically estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. Significant changes in key assumptions about the business, market conditions and prospects for which the intangible asset is currently utilized or expected to be utilized could result in an impairment charge.\nIn conjunction with the termination of the Pioneer production and distribution agreements, we recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge of intangible assets related to the Pioneer distribution agreements for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services. Under such provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, under the straight-line method, over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant).\nWe account for equity instruments, including stock options issued to non-employees, in accordance with authoritative guidance for equity-based payments to non-employees (FASB ASC 505-50). Stock options issued to non-employees are accounted for at their estimated fair value. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is re-measured as they vest.\nWe utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted under share-based compensation plans. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires us to estimate a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the expected term of the award, stock price volatility, dividend rate, risk-free interest rate. The input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. The expected term used represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding. We have used the historical volatility for our stock for the expected volatility assumption required in the model, as it is more representative of future stock price trends. We use a risk-free interest rate that is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issued with an equivalent remaining term at the time of grant. We have not paid dividends in the past and currently do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, and as such, dividend yield is assumed to be zero for the purposes of valuing the stock options granted. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change, and we employ different assumptions, share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. When there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees, our share-based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants.\nIncome Taxes\nWe regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent management believes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, an income tax charge is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. If the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated, we would be required to write-off the\nremaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision, resulting in a reduction of earnings and stockholders' equity.\nInventories\nAll inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods. Depending on market conditions, the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date, we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. The factors include the age of inventory, the amount of inventory held by type, future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time, using available information, expected business plans and expected market conditions. We perform a review of our inventory by product line on a quarterly basis.\nOur subsidiary, S&W Australia, does not fix the final price for seed payable to its growers until the completion of a given year's sales cycle pursuant to its standard contract production agreement. We record an estimated unit price accordingly, inventory, cost of revenue and gross profits are based upon management's best estimate of the final purchase price to our S&W Australia growers. To the extent the estimated purchase price varies from the final purchase price for seed, the adjustment to actual could materially impact the results in the period when the difference between estimates and actuals are identified. If the actual purchase price is in excess of our estimated purchase price, this would negatively impact our financial results including a reduction in gross profits and earnings.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $8.8 million, which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. $4.8 million of this write-down related to dormant alfalfa seed products. The termination of the distribution and production agreements with Pioneer altered our planned consumption of these varieties and as a result we determined this particular dormant seed inventory will need to be sold to alternative sales channels at lower selling prices. The remaining inventory write-down primarily relates to changes in our assessment of the future market prices for non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties. The changes in our assessment occurred as we updated our business plans taking into account activity during the fourth quarter, which is the height of the sales season for non-dormant varieties.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a write-down of inventory in the amount of $2.3 million which is included in Cost of Revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The write-down of inventory during the year ended June 30, 2020 was primarily related to certain inventory lots that deteriorated in quality and germination rates during the year.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe regularly assess the collectability of receivables and provide an allowance for doubtful trade receivables equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. That estimate is based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our accounts receivable under current conditions; however, unexpected, significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 96: <table> <tr> <td>
