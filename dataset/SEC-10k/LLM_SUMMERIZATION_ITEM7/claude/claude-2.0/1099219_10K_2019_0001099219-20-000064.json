See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to our performance measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on GAAP. See - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for definitions and a discussion of these and other financial measures, and - Results of Operations\u201d for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFor information relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in MetLife, Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nMetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nDuring 2019, overall sales increased compared to 2018 as improved sales in our U.S. Group Benefits business, as well as in Latin America and EMEA, more than offset lower sales in Japan. Positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio; however, investment yields declined and interest credited rates were higher. Underwriting experience was unfavorable compared to 2018 and results in both 2019 and 2018 included a charge due to the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review. In addition, our 2019 results benefited from certain tax settlements. A favorable change in net investment gains (losses) primarily reflects 2018 losses on the fair value option ( FVO\u201d) Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock ( FVO Brighthouse Common Stock\u201d) and higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities. An unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) was primarily the result of changes in key equity index levels, partially offset by a decline in interest rates.\nThe following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n_______________\n(1) Excludes Corporate & Other adjusted loss available to common shareholders of $401 million.\n(2) Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated Results -

Results of Operations - Consolidated Results,\u201d - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\u201d and - Results of Operations - Segment Results and Corporate & Other.\u201d\nConsolidated Company Outlook\nAt the December 2019 Investor Day, we introduced our Next Horizon Strategy which is founded on three pillars: (i) Focus\u201d - generate strong free cash flow by deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities, (ii) Simplify\u201d - simplify our business to deliver operational efficiency and an outstanding customer experience, and (iii) Differentiate\u201d - drive competitive advantage through our brand, scale, talent, and innovation. The pillars of our Next Horizon Strategy are the basis of our ability to create and deliver optimal shareholder value.\nWe continue to shift our business mix to protection-oriented and fee-based businesses. As a result, we expect our results to be less sensitive to interest rates. Assuming interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves, as of the year ended December 31, 2019, we expect the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 to be 65% to 75%, assuming a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate between 1.5% and 4.5%. We believe that free cash flow is a key determinant of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. We have returned approximately $16.0 billion to shareholders from 2016 through 2019 and we expect to generate approximately $20.0 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, while maintaining a $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion buffer of liquid assets at the holding companies.\nDespite the prolonged low interest rate environment, we continue to project adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d) other than foreign currency translation adjustments ( FCTA\u201d), of 12% to 14% over the near-term. This target reflects the completion of restructuring charges related to our unit cost improvement program in 2019 which we project will result in approximately $900 million of pre-tax expense margin expansion in 2020. We expect to maintain this margin by holding to a 12.3% direct expense ratio in 2020, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, while creating additional capacity to fund over $1.0 billion in incremental technology and innovation investments to accelerate our growth over the next five years.\nWhen making these and other projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. Additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury, SEC or the FASB may require us to revise these projections in future periods.\nOther Key Information\nArgentina Highly Inflationary\nThe inflation levels in Argentina have been elevated for several years. In the first half of 2018, Argentina's reported inflation rates began to increase dramatically and the Argentine central bank significantly increased interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Based on Argentina's reported inflation rates and trends, as of July 1, 2018, we designated Argentina as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. The application of highly inflationary accounting did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIndustry Trends\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition.\u201d\nWe have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. For example, MetLife is the largest provider of benefits to Mexican federal government personnel and public officials, however, the administration of President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico is implementing an austerity plan which, among other measures, has eliminated benefits such as major medical insurance and contributions to additional savings benefit insurance for such individuals. See Business - Regulation - Fiscal Measures\u201d and Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, events following the U.K. referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its withdrawal from the EU have contributed to global market volatility. These factors could contribute to weakening Gross Domestic Product growth, primarily in the U.K. and, to a lesser degree, in continental Europe and beyond. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the negotiations regarding future trade and other arrangements. See - Investments - Current Environment - Selected Country and Sector Investments.\u201d We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the possibility of government shutdowns or a failure to raise the debt ceiling, due to a policy impasse or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and liquidity. See Business - Regulation - Cross-Border Trade\u201d and Business - Regulation - Fiscal Measures.\u201d See also Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition\u201d and Risk Factors - Business Risks - The Global Nature of Our Operations Exposes Us to a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks.\u201d\nCentral banks around the world are using monetary policy to address regional economic conditions. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board which had been tightening monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate and shrinking the balance sheet, now has lowered rates to sustain the economic expansion and has begun to expand its balance sheet once again to reduce liquidity issues in financing markets. The European Central Bank has resumed quantitative easing for as long as necessary and left its deposit interest rate unchanged at its historic low. In Japan, the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are maintaining stimulus measures in order to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. Such measures include the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate. Going forward, Japan's structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan's high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks. Further actions by central banks in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other developed and emerging economies, and may ultimately result in market volatility. We cannot predict with certainty the effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio or derivatives. See - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Sustained periods of low U.S. interest rates, may cause us to:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets ( gross margin\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase our reserves or trigger loss recognition events related to policy liabilities, accelerate amortization of DAC and VOBA, and potentially impair intangible assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Experience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For additional discussion on gross margin and interest rate assumptions, as well as the potential impact of low interest rates, see Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Interest Rate Risk;\u201d Risk Factors - Business Risks - We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization of or Impair DAC, DSI or VOBA;\u201d Risk Factors - Business Risks - We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets;\u201d Risk Factors - Business Risks - Guarantees Within Certain Products May Decrease Our Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results, Result in Higher Risk Management Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty Risk;\u201d and - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018 - Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments.\u201d\nMitigating Actions\nTo mitigate unfavorable impacts of a low U.S. interest rate environment, we maintain diversification across products, distribution channels, and geographies while proactively evaluating interest rate and product strategies. In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) strategies, including the use of derivatives, and may take management actions such as:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lowering interest crediting rates or adjusting the dividend scale on products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Limiting or closing certain products to new sales to manage exposures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shifting sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive mitigation strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help mitigate unfavorable impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we expect adjusted earnings will continue to increase over the near term despite the sustained low U.S. interest rate environment.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Interest Rate Risk;\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities;\u201d and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures.\u201d\nLow Interest Rate Scenario\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to lower U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of a hypothetical low interest rate environment (the Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d) relative to the economic assumptions used for our insurance contracts (the Base Scenario\u201d) through 2022.\nThe Low Interest Rate Scenario assumes an immediate decline of U.S. interest rates for all maturities to 1.00% on January 1, 2020 and subsequent 10 basis point increases for maturities one year and longer on January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2022, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Low Interest Rate Scenario and Base Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant short-term and long-term interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.72%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year U.S. Treasury\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.04%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses) and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives through 2022. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. For purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded all VA program derivatives. For information regarding our VA and non-VA program derivatives, see - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results.\u201d\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings through 2022. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income.\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses) and the adjusted earnings for certain segments, as well as Corporate & Other for the dates indicated:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Derivative Gains (Losses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA Program Derivatives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Earnings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Group Benefits\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement and Income Solutions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property & Casualty\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia (Japan only)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjusted Earnings Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegments and Corporate & Other\nThe primary drivers of the Low Interest Rate Scenario impacting our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, are summarized below. Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nFor additional information regarding account values subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d), and the yield on invested assets, see - Investments;\u201d - Policyholder Liabilities - Policyholder Account Balances;\u201d and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nU.S.\nGroup Benefits\nOur group life insurance products are primarily renewable term policies. This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Less than half of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates. Additionally, we experience gross margin compression from our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate risk for both products.\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions.\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nThis business contains both short and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nA significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. The Low Interest Rate Scenario does not assume any additional ALM actions we may take in our capital markets business.\nOur long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nProperty & Casualty\nOur products primarily consist of six-month and annual term renewable policies and do not have policyholder benefits linked to interest rates. This provides significant re-pricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nAsia\nOur Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded businesses outside of Japan given their insignificant U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nMetLife Holdings\nOur interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since most of our traditional life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. Although we are able mitigate gross margin compression by lowering interest crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies, these actions may be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees.\nOur annuity products experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these contracts are at their minimum crediting rate, and, therefore we use interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate gross margin compression.\nOur long-term care business experiences gross margin compression as we cannot reduce interest crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 7% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements, and our outstanding debt and preferred securities. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets is partially offset by the positive impact of lower interest expense on collateral financing and variable rate debt.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the preferred stock dividend impact is excluded and the impact on pension and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate & Other and not allocated across segments. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase, however, the impact is offset by corresponding returns on the fixed income plan assets resulting in lower expenses.\nCompetitive Pressures\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See Business - Competition.\u201d Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Several of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the capability to engage with the new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets and its impact on the capital position of many competitors will continue to strain the competitive environment. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See Business - Regulation.\u201d We believe that the aforementioned factors have highlighted financial strength, technology efficiency, and organizational agility as the most significant differentiators and, as a result, we believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment.\nRegulatory Developments\nIn the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. See Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\u201d Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products and, in some states, instituted a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions. See Business - Regulation,\u201d Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases, and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,\u201d Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Capital - Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.\u201d\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>investment impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td>measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ix)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 6.75%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $17.8 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. Amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the variable and universal life and annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General account investment return\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separate account investment return\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment/Net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force/Persistency\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder dividends, expense and other\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(233\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2019 consisted of the following:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net increase in amortization of $106 million associated with net investment/net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB, primarily driven by the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>An increase in amortization of $25 million from net derivative gains from freestanding derivatives hedging the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million from net derivative losses resulting from the increases in variable annuity guarantee obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>A decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million associated with gains from GMIB hedges and the decreases in GMIB obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net increase in amortization of approximately $100 million from other investment activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net increase in general account investment return mostly due to net investment income assumption unlocking and an update to the yield curve for market value adjustment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2018 consisted of the following:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net increase in amortization of $215 million associated with net investment/net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB, primarily driven by the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>An increase in amortization of $90 million from net derivative gains from freestanding derivatives hedging the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of approximately $30 million from net derivative losses resulting from the increases in variable annuity guarantee obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>An increase in amortization of approximately $35 million associated with gains from GMIB hedges and the decreases in GMIB obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net increase in amortization of approximately $100 million from the annual actuarial assumption review and other investment activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized. The increase in unrealized investment gains (losses) decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by $1.5 billion in 2019. The decrease in unrealized investment gains (losses) increased the DAC and VOBA balance by $521 million in 2018. See Notes 5 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized investment gains (losses).\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to fixed maturity securities AFS is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.\nThe impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads decreased as compared to prior periods. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Changes in Balance Sheet Carrying Value At December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Policyholder Account Balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DAC and VOBA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100% increase in our credit spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50% decrease in our credit spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of the effectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we tested the MetLife Holdings life insurance reporting unit for impairment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 43% and, therefore, the reporting unit was not impaired. If we had assumed that the discount rate was 100 basis points higher than the discount rate used, the estimated fair value of the MetLife Holdings life insurance reporting unit would have been higher than the carrying value by approximately 22%. This reporting unit consists of operations relating to products and businesses we no longer actively market. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit was $887 million.\nWe also performed our annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2019 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2019. We concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nWe apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2018, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $100 million and an increase of $100 million, respectively, in 2019. This considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.\nWe determine the discount rates used to value the Company's pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2018, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $97 million and an increase of $94 million, respectively, in 2019. This considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee also Notes 1 and 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. For further information, see Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisition of PetFirst\nIn December 2019, the Company and PetFirst Healthcare, LLC ( PetFirst\u201d), a fast-growing pet health insurance administrator, entered into a definitive agreement under which MetLife will acquire PetFirst. The transaction closed in January 2020.\nAcquisition of Willing\nIn November 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Bequest, Inc. ( Willing\u201d), a leading digital estate planning service. This transaction brings new digital capabilities to the Company and reinforces its commitment to providing simple and easy-to-use benefits that respond to consumer needs.\nPending Disposition of MetLife Hong Kong\nFor information regarding the Company's definitive agreement to sell, MetLife Hong Kong, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisposition of MetLife Afore\nFor information regarding the Company's 2018 disposition of MetLife Afore, S.A. de C.V. ( MetLife Afore\u201d), its pension fund management business in Mexico, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeparation of Brighthouse\nIn 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Brighthouse\u201d) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the Separation\u201d). For information regarding the Separation, the Company's 2018 sale of the FVO Brighthouse Common Stock, and ongoing transactions between MetLife and Brighthouse, see Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales for 2019 increased over 2018 levels reflecting higher sales in the majority of our businesses. In our U.S. segment, sales increased in our Group Benefits business as a result of strong sales in both our core and voluntary products. In our RIS business, sales were slightly lower, as higher funding agreement issuances and structured settlement sales were more than offset by lower sales of pension risk transfers and stable value products. Sales in our Asia segment decreased as a result of lower sales in Japan, a large group case in Australia in 2018, and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong, partially offset by higher sales in Korea. Sales in our Latin America segment improved as a result of higher sales in Mexico, Brazil and Chile. In our EMEA segment, sales improved as a result of increases in Turkey, the U.K. and Egypt.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>5,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>18,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>69,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>42,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>6,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(3,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>2,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>13,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>62,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before provision for income tax\n</td> <td>6,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>5,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc.\n</td> <td>5,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDuring 2019, net income (loss) increased $781 million from 2018, primarily driven by a favorable change in net investment gains (losses) and an increase in adjusted earnings, which includes benefits from certain tax settlements, partially offset by an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses).\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within contractholder-directed equity securities and fair value option securities ( FVO Securities\u201d) (collectively, Unit-linked and FVO Securities\u201d), contractholder-directed equity securities supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities ( Unit-linked investments\u201d), which do not qualify as separate account assets. Returns on these Unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. We continuously review and refine our strategy and ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as VA program derivatives.\u201d All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives.\u201d The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange rate\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>(403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(162\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risks in embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other risks in embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivatives hedging embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $252 million ($199 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to a favorable change in interest rate impact due to long-term U.S. interest rates decreasing in 2019 and increasing in 2018, favorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps, options and total rate of return swaps. In addition, credit spreads narrowed in 2019 and widened in 2018, favorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in 2019 versus 2018, unfavorably impacting foreign currency forwards and swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. In addition, key equity markets increasing in 2019 versus decreasing in 2018 unfavorably impacted equity options acquired primarily as part of our macro hedge program. There was also a change in the value of the underlying assets, unfavorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the items being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $475 million ($375 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $249 million ($197 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $235 million ($186 million, net of income tax) in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, net of market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a favorable change of $9 million, ($7 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.\nThe aforementioned $235 million ($186 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change reflects a $1.1 billion ($898 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a $902 million ($713 million, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term U.S. interest rates decreased in 2019 and increased in 2018, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased 75 basis points in 2019 and increased 30 basis points in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Key equity index levels increased in 2019 and decreased in 2018, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index increased 29% in 2019 and decreased 6% in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The aforementioned $9 million ($7 million, net of income tax) favorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflects actuarial assumption updates and a combination of factors, which include fees deducted from accounts, changes in the benefit base, premiums, lapses, withdrawals and deaths.\nThe aforementioned $249 million ($197 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from an unfavorable change of $137 million, before income tax, related to model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees in addition to an unfavorable change of $112 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when the driver moves in the opposite direction.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $742 million ($586 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects 2018 losses on FVO Brighthouse Common Stock comprised of a change in fair value through date of disposal and loss on disposal, as well as mark-to-market losses on equity securities in 2018, both of which are measured at fair value through net income. Additionally, there were higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities AFS in 2019 versus 2018. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses.\nDivested Businesses. Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $18 million ($6 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $104 million ($84 million, net of income tax) in 2019 from a loss of $122 million ($90 million, net of income tax) in 2018. Included in this increase was an increase in total revenues of $115 million, before income tax, and an increase in total expenses of $97 million, before income tax. Divested businesses primarily include activity related to the Separation and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong.\nTaxes. Our 2019 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 13%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and the impact from the definitive agreement to sell MetLife Hong Kong. Our 2018 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 19%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, the settlement of tax audits and a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate, U.S. Tax Reform, a non-deductible loss incurred on the mark-to-market and disposition of FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and a tax adjustment in Chile.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for 2019 include a $201 million ($162 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $31 million loss ($27 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $201 million charge, $49 million ($37 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $152 million ($125 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $201 million charge that was included in adjusted earnings was $179 million ($143 million, net of income tax).\nThe $31 million loss ($27 million, net of income tax) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives line in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the MetLife Holdings segment, driven by the projection of closed block results and economic updates. The breakdown of total 2019 results is summarized as follows:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Economic assumption updates resulted in a net charge of $151 million ($117 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in biometric assumptions resulted in a net charge of $21 million ($15 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in a favorable impact of $16 million ($14 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Changes in operational assumptions, most notably related to closed block projections, resulted in a net charge of $44 million ($44 million, net of income tax).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Results for 2018 include a $358 million ($272 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $131 million loss ($94 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $358 million charge, $20 million ($20 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $338 million ($252 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $358 million charge that is included in adjusted earnings is $53 million ($42 million, net of income tax).\nCertain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2019 include a $22 million ($17 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2019 increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. Certain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2018 include a $79 million ($63 million, net of income tax) charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments are included in adjusted earnings.\nAdjusted Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis should not be viewed as substitutes for net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders increased $306 million, net of income tax, to $5.8 billion, net of income tax, for 2019 from $5.5 billion, net of income tax, for 2018.\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were benefits from certain tax settlements and higher net investment income due to growth in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher interest credited expense, unfavorable underwriting and the unfavorable impact of our annual actuarial assumption review.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $78 million negative impact on adjusted earnings for 2019 compared to 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. We benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of our Asia and U.S. segments resulted in higher net investment income. However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expenses on certain insurance-related liabilities. Higher fee income in our Asia, Latin America and EMEA segments was largely offset by lower fee income in our MetLife Holdings segment. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions, which was offset by higher DAC capitalization. A decrease in expenses was primarily due to the 2019 abatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by higher DAC amortization, resulted in a $206 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively affected by lower yields on fixed income securities, lower income from derivatives and lower returns on real estate investments. In addition, lower earnings from our securities lending program resulted primarily from lower margins and balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher returns on FVO Securities, equity-linked notes and hedge funds. The decrease in investment yields was more than offset by an increase in asset-based fee income and lower DAC amortization in MetLife Holdings, both driven by higher equity returns, and a decrease in average interest credited expenses, primarily in Asia. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $44 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a $121 million decrease in adjusted earnings primarily as a result of higher claims and lapses in our Asia segment, less favorable mortality in our MetLife Holdings and Latin America segments, and an increase in non-catastrophe claim costs and adverse prior year development in our Property & Casualty business, partially offset by favorable claims experience and favorable mortality, primarily in our Group Benefits business, and lower catastrophe losses. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $101 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to less favorable assumption changes in our MetLife Holdings segment in 2019. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in 2019 and 2018, resulted in an $8 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nInterest Expense on Debt. Interest expense on debt decreased by $82 million, primarily due to the exchange of senior notes for FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and the redemption of senior notes for cash in 2018, partially offset by a premium paid in excess of the debt principal and accrued and unpaid interest on senior notes redeemed in 2019.\nExpenses. Expenses increased compared to 2018, which resulted in a $53 million decrease in adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, including the continued investment in our unit cost initiative and a prior period reduction of a litigation reserve in Argentina, partially offset by lower legal expenses, interest on uncertain tax positions and employee-related costs, as well as a decline in costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives.\nTaxes. Our 2019 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 10%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income and tax credits, the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2018 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 16%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income, tax credits, the settlement of tax audits and a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and a tax adjustment in Chile.\nSegment Results and Corporate & Other\nU.S.\nBusiness Overview. Sales increased compared to 2018, primarily driven by our Group Benefits business, as a result of strong sales in both our core and voluntary products. In our RIS business, sales were slightly lower than 2018, as higher funding agreement issuances and structured settlement sales were more than offset by lower sales of pension risk transfers (driven by a large transaction in the second quarter of 2018) and stable value products. Changes in premiums for the RIS business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. In our Property & Casualty business, sales were relatively flat compared to 2018. In addition, the number of exposures decreased from 2018, reflecting management actions to improve the quality of the business.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>7,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>35,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>26,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>32,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. The impact of positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions in both 2019 and 2018 and funding agreement issuances in 2019 resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets, interest credited expenses on long-duration liabilities increased. Higher volume-related, premium tax and direct expenses, driven by business growth, were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses. This net increase in expenses, partially offset by the decrease due to the 2019 abatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA, was more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $111 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased, primarily due to lower income from derivatives, lower yields on fixed income securities and real estate investments, lower returns on private equity funds and lower earnings from our securities lending program, primarily from lower margins and balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher yields on mortgage loans. In addition, net investment income increased as a result of the impact of an increased crediting rate on interest on economic capital. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in an increase in our average interest credited rates on deposit-type liabilities, partially offset by lower rates on our long-duration liabilities, which drove a net increase in interest credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $176 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable claims experience and the impact of growth in our Group Benefits business resulted in a $95 million increase in adjusted earnings. This was primarily driven by lower claim severity, favorable renewal results and an increase in recoveries in our group disability business. In both our accident & health and individual disability businesses, the impact of growth in the business and favorable claims experience also contributed to the increase in adjusted earnings. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable dental results, driven by an increase in utilization and the impact of unfavorable prior period development in 2019. Favorable mortality, driven by claims experience in our term life business, primarily due to lower severity in 2019 and the unfavorable impact of the influenza virus in 2018, partially offset by less favorable mortality in our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, income annuities and specialized benefit resources businesses, resulted in a $42 million increase in adjusted earnings. In our Property & Casualty business, adjusted earnings decreased $77 million, the result of higher non-catastrophe claims costs, driven by higher severities in both our auto and homeowner businesses and a net increase in frequencies, with an increase in our auto business being mostly offset in our homeowner business, coupled with higher losses in the commercial business. In addition, adverse prior year development, due to auto non-catastrophe claims costs impacting the estimate of ultimate losses for prior accident years, predominantly for casualty coverages, contributed to this decrease. These unfavorable results were partially offset by lower catastrophe costs. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities recorded in both 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $48 million increase to adjusted earnings, which included the impact of favorable insurance adjustments resulting from enhancements to our claim-related processes, and the 2018 favorable net insurance adjustments resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business.\nAsia\nBusiness Overview. Sales decreased compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales of foreign currency-denominated annuity products in Japan, a large group case in Australia in the prior period, and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong, partially offset by higher sales in Korea due to higher sales of retirement products and a new life product launch.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>3,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>12,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>5,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(1,913\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>3,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>10,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $29 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Asia's premiums, fees and other revenues decreased slightly as compared to 2018, mainly driven by the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong and a decrease in premiums from yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by a related decline in policyholder benefits, as well as growth in accident & health and foreign currency-denominated life products in Japan. Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets, which improved net investment income. The increase in net investment income was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expenses on certain insurance liabilities. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth improved adjusted earnings by $122 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment results were favorably impacted by higher derivative income, earnings from our operating joint venture in China (mainly driven by a regulatory change), returns from hedge funds, private equities and real estate investments, as well as higher yields on mortgage loans. These increases were partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities supporting U.S. dollar-denominated products sold in Japan, and fixed income securities in Bangladesh and Korea. In addition, lower interest credited rates improved adjusted earnings. The changes in market factors discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $102 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Higher claims and lapses primarily in Japan and Korea decreased adjusted earnings by $99 million. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net increase of $67 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in 2019 and 2018, resulted in a slight increase in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. Expenses increased as compared to 2018, which reduced adjusted earnings by $5 million. Various tax items in both 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $9 million increase in adjusted earnings. Results for 2019 include a charge of $8 million related to a withholding tax provision on dividends from our operating joint venture in China and a $6 million benefit due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return.\nLatin America\nBusiness Overview. Total sales for Latin America increased compared to 2018, driven by higher group and individual medical sales in Mexico, higher universal and variable life sales in Mexico and Chile, and higher dental and life sales in Brazil, partially offset by lower retirement sales in Chile.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>5,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>2,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $27 million for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the weakening of the Argentine and Chilean pesos against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Latin America experienced growth across several lines of business primarily within Chile and Mexico. This growth resulted in increased premiums and policy fee income, which was partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows, primarily from Chile and Argentina, partially offset by Mexico, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. Although business growth drove an increase in commissions, net of DAC capitalization, this was more than offset by decreases in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities and other variable expenses. The combined impact of the items affecting business growth, including higher DAC amortization, increased adjusted earnings by $62 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased, driven by higher yields on FVO Securities, due to the favorable impact of equity markets on our Chilean encaje and fixed income securities in Argentina, Chile and Mexico. These increases in investment yields were partially offset by lower private equity returns in Chile and Mexico, as well as lower yields on mortgage loans and lower derivative income, both in Chile. The changes in market factors discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $61 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable underwriting resulted in a $23 million decrease to adjusted earnings primarily driven by higher claims experience in Mexico. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $18 million in adjusted earnings. In addition, refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in 2019 and 2018, primarily in Brazil, resulted in a $12 million increase to adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. A $60 million increase in expenses was primarily the result of a prior period reduction of a litigation reserve in Argentina, along with various other expense increases. Adjusted earnings increased by $13 million due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return. Other tax-related adjustments in 2019 and 2018, primarily related to foreign exchange volatility in Argentina, resulted in a net decrease in adjusted earnings of $29 million. Results for 2018 also include tax expenses of $24 million driven by a $17 million tax charge related to a tax adjustment in Chile and a $5 million tax charge in Colombia to establish a deferred tax liability due to a change in tax status.\nEMEA\nBusiness Overview. Sales increased compared to 2018 primarily driven by increases in our credit life business in Turkey and in our employee benefits business in the U.K. and Egypt.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>2,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $22 million for 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira, the euro, the British pound and the Polish zloty. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Growth from our accident & health and credit life businesses in Turkey and across several European markets, partially offset by a decrease in our pensions business in Romania due to regulatory changes, increased adjusted earnings by $10 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, impacted our results favorably by $4 million primarily due to higher investment yields in Turkey and Ukraine.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Unfavorable underwriting decreased adjusted earnings by $5 million as a result of unfavorable experience in (i) our credit life business in Turkey and (ii) across several businesses in European markets (primarily our employee benefits business in the U.K.), partially offset by favorable experience in our employee benefits and accident & health businesses in the Gulf region. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net increase of $10 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance-related assets and liabilities that were recorded in 2019 and 2018 resulted in an $8 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. Adjusted earnings decreased by $6 million, primarily driven by higher expenses in Europe due to transformation costs and regulatory fees, partially offset by lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives. Adjusted earnings increased by $6 million due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return, partially offset by the prior period release of provisions arising from the finalization of historical corporate tax filings and changes in business mix among tax jurisdictions.\nMetLife Holdings\nBusiness Overview. Our MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses, previously included in our former retail business, that we no longer actively market in the United States. We anticipate an average decline in premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% per year from expected business run-off. A significant portion of our adjusted earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by movements in the market, surrenders, deposits, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment, and we expect the related reserves to grow as this block matures. As of December 31, 2019, our future policyholder benefit liability for our long-term care business was $12.5 billion.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>5,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>10,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>6,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>9,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. Negative net flows from our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life deposits resulted in lower fee income. Lower net investment income, resulting from a reduced invested asset base, primarily in fixed income securities, also decreased adjusted earnings. The reduced invested asset base was primarily the result of the negative net flows in our deferred annuities and life businesses. The decline was partially offset by invested asset growth from our long-term care business. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $103 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. In our deferred annuity business, higher equity returns drove an increase in asset-based fee income and lower DAC amortization, increasing adjusted earnings. Investment yields decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixed income securities and lower returns on real estate investments. The decline in investment yields was partially offset by increased prepayment fees and higher returns on hedge funds. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $17 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review, and Other Insurance Adjustments. Adjusted earnings decreased $47 million, primarily driven by less favorable underwriting in our traditional life business. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $160 million in adjusted earnings. Changes mainly in mortality, and economic and operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, were less favorable in 2019. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $62 million decrease in adjusted earnings. This includes a 2019 charge due to an increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves, reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims, as well as the following 2018 refinements: (i) a favorable reserve adjustment relating to certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former joint venture in Japan; (ii) favorable reserve adjustments resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; and (iii) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims.\nExpenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $114 million due to declines in employee-related costs and lower operational expenses as a result of enterprise-wide initiatives.\nCorporate & Other\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(1,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>(223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents adjusted earnings available to common shareholders by source:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>(978\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,076\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate initiatives and projects\n</td> <td>(563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(405\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax (expense) benefit and other tax-related items\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>(178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Activities. Adjusted earnings from business activities increased $23 million. This was primarily related to improved results from certain of our businesses.\nNet Investment Income. Variability in equity market results increased returns on both FVO Securities and equity-linked notes. In addition, lower losses on tax credit partnerships favorably impacted net investment income. These increases were partially offset by decreased income on fixed income securities, mortgage loans and lower returns on private equities and real estate investments, resulting in an increase of $21 million in net investment income.\nInterest Expense on Debt. Interest expense on debt decreased by $77 million, primarily due to the exchange of senior notes for FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and the redemption of senior notes for cash in 2018, partially offset by a premium paid in excess of the debt principal and accrued and unpaid interest on senior notes redeemed in 2019.\nCorporate Initiatives and Projects. Adjusted earnings decreased $125 million due to higher expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects, most notably, costs associated with the continued investment in our unit cost initiative, partially offset by lower costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives.\nProvision for Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Other Tax-Related Items. A favorable change in Corporate & Other's effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, 2019 and 2018 include benefits from the settlement of tax audits related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. The 2018 provision for income tax (expense) benefit and other tax related items also included a tax benefit from a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent and a reduction in adjusted earnings related to certain tax impacts on tax credit partnership investments.\nOther. Adjusted earnings increased $30 million, primarily as a result of lower interest expenses on certain tax positions, lower legal expenses and declines in various other expenses, partially offset by a loss related to the sale of a run-off business that was previously reinsured, as well as increases in certain corporate-related expenses.\nPreferred Stock Dividends. Preferred stock dividends increased $37 million as a result of the issuance of MetLife, Inc.'s 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D ( Series D preferred stock\u201d) and MetLife, Inc.'s 5.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E ( Series E preferred stock\u201d) in 2018.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investment Risk Committee and Asset-Liability Steering Committee review and monitor investment risk limits and tolerances.\nWe are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed income investments and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers, tenants and our joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, changes in market interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by the Investment Risk Committee, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies which are reviewed and approved by the Asset-Liability Steering Committee. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain NGEs of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk.\nWe enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determines that a credit event has occurred.\nWe use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging, which gives us more flexibility in managing our credit exposures. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.\nCurrent Environment\nAs a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, as well as the monetary policy of central banks around the world. See - Industry Trends - Financial and Economic Environment.\u201d Measures taken by central banks, including with respect to the level of interest rates, may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. The current environment continues to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition.\u201d\nSelected Country and Sector Investments\nWe have country-specific exposure to volatility as a result of our general account investments which support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, as well as our global portfolio diversification objectives.\nWe also have sector-specific exposure to volatility, in the energy sector, as a result of variable oil prices.\nSelected Country: The following table presents a summary of selected country fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities AFS if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as perpetual hybrid securities,\u201d have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or Tier 1 capital\u201d and perpetual deferrable securities, or Upper Tier 2 capital\u201d).\nRedeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities AFS. These securities, which are commonly referred to as capital securities,\u201d primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.\nValuation of Securities. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services' use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities AFS were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2019.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, new transaction types and markets are reviewed and approved to ensure that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. Senior management oversees the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing.\nWe review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management's knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. We ensure that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as consensus pricing,\u201d are representative of estimated fair value by considering such pricing relative to our knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio.\nWe also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management's best estimate is used.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three-level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets.\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Maturity\nSecurities AFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\nSecurities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>287,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant other observable inputs\n</td> <td>287,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>15,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>2,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent broker quotations\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant unobservable inputs\n</td> <td>18,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy.\nThe majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors at December 31, 2019: foreign corporate securities, U.S. corporate securities and RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $4.0 billion, or 26%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and by an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3.\nSee - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities - Valuation of Securities\u201d for further information regarding the composition of fair value pricing sources for securities. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities and continuous gross unrealized losses.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called NAIC designations.\u201d If no designation is available from the NAIC, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities AFS, except for certain non-agency RMBS and CMBS as described below. Rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investor Service ( Moody's\u201d), S&P, Fitch Ratings ( Fitch\u201d), Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best Company ( A.M. Best\u201d), Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC ( Morningstar\u201d). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS, and CMBS. The NAIC's objective with the revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS and CMBS was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC's present methodology is to evaluate non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available. NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using the revised NAIC methodologies, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair

Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nThe majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody's, S&P or Fitch; and were designated NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ( Alt-A\u201d) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.\nHistorically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).\nABS\nOur ABS portfolio is diversified by collateral type and issuer.

The most significant increase in OTTI losses was in foreign government securities, which comprised $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. An increase of $72 million in OTTI losses was concentrated in Argentine foreign government securities and was due to the weakening of the Argentine peso and issuer specific concerns.\nFuture Impairments\nFuture impairments on fixed maturity securities AFS will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings, and collateral valuation. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, credit losses may be incurred in upcoming periods. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new guidance to be adopted in 2020 regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.\nContractholder-Directed Equity Securities and Fair Value Option Securities\nThe estimated fair value of these investments, which are primarily comprised of Unit-linked investments, was $13.1 billion and $12.6 billion, or 2.7% and 2.8% of cash and invested assets, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of this portfolio, its fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for these investments measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSecurities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and FHLB of Boston Advance Agreements\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We also participate in short-term repurchase agreement transactions with unaffiliated financial institutions. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company has entered into short-term advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Securities Lending and Repurchase Agreements\u201d and Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loans held-for-investment are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties.

Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan held-for-investment portfolios, 83% are collateralized by properties located in the United States, with the remaining 17% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, which includes 5% of properties located in the U.K., at December 31, 2019. The carrying values of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment located in California, New York and Texas were 18%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment at December 31, 2019. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\nWe manage our residential mortgage loan held-for-investment portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with 93% collateralized by properties located in the United States, and the remaining 7% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, at December 31, 2019.

We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans and impaired mortgage loans.\nWe review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.\nLoan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 55% at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.4x and 2.5x at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 47% and 46% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nMortgage Loan Valuation Allowances. Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.\nThe determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new guidance to be adopted in 2020 regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored and activity in and balances of the valuation allowance as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nReal estate and real estate joint ventures is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate, and to a lesser extent joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as a runoff portfolio. The carrying values of real estate and real estate joint ventures was $10.7 billion and $9.7 billion, or 2.2% and 2.1% of cash and invested assets, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nImpairments recognized on real estate and real estate joint ventures were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no impairments for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration.\nGeographical diversification: Of our real estate investments, excluding funds, 61% were located in the United States, with the remaining 39% located outside the United States, at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in Japan, California and Washington, D.C. were 34%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at December 31, 2019. Real estate funds were 24% of our real estate investments at December 31, 2019. The majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the United States.\nProperty type diversification: Real estate and real estate joint venture investments by property type are categorized by sector as follows at:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>2,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apartment\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel\n</td> <td>599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate and real estate joint ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds.

Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nDerivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2019 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At December 31, 2019, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curves.

In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nWe maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as committed facilities, with various financial institutions. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of such arrangements, the classification of expenses on such credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these credit and committed facilities. See also - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Global Funding Sources - Credit and Committed Facilities.\u201d\nCollateral for Securities Lending, Third-Party Custodian Administered Repurchase Programs and Derivatives\nWe participate in a securities lending program and third-party custodian administered repurchase programs in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our securities lending program and repurchase agreement transactions, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangements and associated liabilities.\nSecurities lending: Periodically we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $0 and $78 million at estimated fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThird-party custodian administered repurchase programs: We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities AFS to unaffiliated financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the unaffiliated financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was $85 million and $78 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was $90 million and $84 million, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives: We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We receive non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral\u201d and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.\nLease Commitments\nAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nSee Guarantees\u201d in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nWe enter into the following additional commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Net Investment Income\u201d and Net Investment Gains (Losses)\u201d in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, and gains and losses from such investments. See also - Investments - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\u201d and - Investments - Mortgage Loans\u201d for information on our investments in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. See - Investments - Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\u201d and - Investments - Other Limited Partnership Interests\u201d for information on our partnership investments.\nOther than the commitments disclosed in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. For further information on commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nInsolvency Assessments\nSee Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future.\nWe periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. We also use hedging, reinsurance and other risk management activities to mitigate financial market volatility.\nSee Business - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis\u201d for information regarding required analyses of the adequacy of statutory reserves of our insurance operations.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nWe establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, - Industry Trends - Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment - Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d and - Variable Annuity Guarantees.\u201d A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate & Other) follows.\nU.S.\nAmounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities, as well as property and casualty policies. For group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. For group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various interest rate derivative positions. The components of future policy benefits related to our property and casualty policies are liabilities for unpaid claims, estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analysis of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nAsia\nFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident & health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower than expected yields, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\nLatin America\nFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in Chile, Mexico and Argentina and traditional life contracts mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. There are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in Mexico. There is limited interest rate crediting flexibility on the immediate annuity and traditional life liabilities. As a result, sustained periods of lower than expected yields could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Other factors impacting these liabilities are actual mortality resulting in higher than expected benefit payments and actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income.\nEMEA\nFuture policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident & health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\nMetLife Holdings\nFuture policy benefits for the life insurance business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. We routinely evaluate our reinsurance programs, which may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various interest rate derivative positions to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance. Other future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. In addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance.\nCorporate & Other\nFuture policy benefits primarily include liabilities for other reinsurance business.\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nPolicyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See - Industry Trends - Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment - Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d and - Variable Annuity Guarantees.\u201d See also Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment follows.\nU.S.\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs.\nGroup Benefits\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Group Benefits:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held largely for investment-type products mainly funding agreements and also include postretirement benefits and corporate owned life insurance to fund non-qualified benefit programs for executives. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) LIBOR. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as interest rate caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for RIS:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsia\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Asia:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life & Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLatin America\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products and universal life products in Mexico and Chile, and deferred annuities in Brazil. Some products in Chile and some of the deferred annuities in Brazil are Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. Many of the other liabilities have minimum credited rate guarantees, which could adversely impact liabilities and earnings in a sustained low interest rate environment.\nEMEA\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuities, pension products, and Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in many of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\nMetLife Holdings\nLife policyholder account balances in this segment are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies, and funding agreements. For annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, non-life contingent income annuities, and embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantees. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, for our other products, policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for the MetLife Holdings segment:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVariable Annuity Guarantees\nWe issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the life-contingent portion of GMWBs, elective GMIB annuitizations, and the life contingent portion of GMIBs that require annuitization when the account balance goes to zero. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At the end of each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMABs, the non-life contingent portion of GMWBs and certain non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below presents the carrying value for guarantees at:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Future Policy\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Policyholder\nAccount Balances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMIB\n</td> <td>756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $147 million and $263 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged.\nThe carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.\nAs discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. We continue to diversify the concentration of income benefits in our portfolio by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities.\nThe sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported on the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, Unit-linked investments that do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.\nGMDBs\nWe offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at December 31, 2019:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Account Value (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia & EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return of premium or five to seven year step-up\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual step-up\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Roll-up and step-up combination\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Total account value excludes $649 million for contracts with no GMDBs.

Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business. We stopped selling GMIBs in February 2016.\nThe table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at December 31, 2019:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\nAccount Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7-year setback, 2.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7-year setback, 1.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year setback, 1.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>4,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 1.0% interest rate\n</td> <td>8,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 0.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection.\nAdditionally, 42% of the $21.5 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of December 31, 2019. These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques reduce or eliminate the need for us to manage the funds' volatility through hedging or reinsurance.\nOur GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of December 31, 2019, only 22% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of four years.\nOnce eligible for annuitization, contractholders would be expected to annuitize only if their contracts were in-the-money. We calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to GMIBs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, by comparing the contractholders' income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. The net amount at risk was $584 million at December 31, 2019, of which $524 million was related to GMIBs.

We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. Futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate.\nWe remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Certain of our reinsurance agreements and all derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see - Industry Trends\u201d and - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.\nShort-term Liquidity\nWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $9.8 billion and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquid Assets\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $221.4 billion and $202.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nCapital Management\nWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee ( ERC\u201d), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer ( CFO\u201d), Treasurer, and Chief Risk Officer ( CRO\u201d). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.'s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\nOur Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.\nSee Risk Factors - Capital Risks - Legal and Regulatory Restrictions May Prevent Us from Paying Dividends and Repurchasing Our Stock\u201d for information regarding restrictions on payment of dividends and stock repurchases. See also Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding MetLife, Inc.'s common stock repurchase authorizations.\nThe Company\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings could also negatively affect our liquidity. See - Rating Agencies.\u201d If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition. See Risk Factors - Investment Risks - We May Have Difficulty Selling Certain Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner and Realizing Full Value.\u201d\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. See - Rating Agencies\u201d for information regarding such ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\nStatutory Capital and Dividends\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\nAs a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business in Delaware or any other U.S. state, it is exempt from RBC requirements under Delaware law. American Life's operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions.\nThe amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to MetLife, Inc. or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See Business - Regulation - Insurance Regulation,\u201d - MetLife, Inc. - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Dividends from Subsidiaries\u201d and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions\nMLIC cedes specific policy classes, including term and universal life insurance, participating whole life insurance, LTD insurance, group life insurance and other business to various wholly-owned captive reinsurers. The reinsurance activities among these affiliated companies are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. The statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. MetLife, Inc. has entered into various support agreements in connection with the activities of these captive reinsurers. See Note 5 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules for further details on certain of these support arrangements. MLIC has entered into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies and other business.\nThe NYDFS continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. We are not aware of any states other than New York and California implementing such a moratorium. While such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our RBC ratios and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. This could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. While this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. We continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our reinsurance activities.\nRating Agencies\nRating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to MetLife, Inc.'s U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in MetLife, Inc.'s securities. Insurer financial strength ratings are not statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nRating agencies use an outlook statement\u201d of positive,\u201d stable,\u201d \u2018\u2018negative'' or developing\u201d to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a stable\u201d outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a stable\u201d rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as CreditWatch\u201d or under review\u201d to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or material changes in a company's results, in order for the rating agency to perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications of the event.\nOur insurer financial strength ratings at the date of this filing are indicated in the following table. Outlook is stable unless otherwise indicated. Additional information about financial strength ratings can be found on the websites of the respective rating agencies.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>A.M.

They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc. or its subsidiaries would likely impact us in the following ways, including:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our RIS business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>impact the cost and availability of financing for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements.

The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, property and casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. Additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption.\nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases of MetLife, Inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in - Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,\u201d the Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nGlobal Funding Sources\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. As a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer\u201d under SEC rules, MetLife, Inc.'s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\nPreferred Stock\nSee Notes 16 and 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\nCommon Stock\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see - Credit and Committed Facilities\u201d). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nCertain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional FHLB. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued $33.0 billion and $27.3 billion, respectively, and repaid $32.8 billion and $27.5 billion, respectively, of funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $15.3 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advance Agreements, Reported in Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we borrowed $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and repaid $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $800 million. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSpecial Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain special purpose entities ( SPEs\u201d) that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued $37.3 billion and $41.8 billion, respectively, and repaid $36.4 billion and $43.7 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $34.6 billion and $32.3 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe have issued funding agreements to a subsidiary of Farmer Mac, as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural mortgage loans. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued $700 million and $900 million, respectively, and repaid $700 million and $900 million, respectively, under such funding agreements. At both December 31, 2019 and 2018, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.6 billion. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt Issuances\nIn May 2019, MetLife, Inc. issued \u00a5151.7 billion ($1.4 billion at issuance) of senior notes for general corporate purposes and the repayment of indebtedness, which included the redemption of certain senior notes. See - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Debt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\u201d and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on credit and committed facilities.\nWe have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments under our credit and committed facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nOutstanding Debt Under Global Funding Sources\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt excluding long-term debt relating to CSEs at:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collateral financing arrangement\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior subordinated debt securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes $136 million and $168 million of debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and MLIC, subject to customary exceptions, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

See Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding shares of common stock repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2019.\nCommon stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc.'s common stock compared to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, and other legal and accounting factors. Restrictions on the payment of dividends that may arise under so-called Dividend Stopper\u201d provisions would also restrict MetLife, Inc.'s ability to repurchase common stock. See - Dividends\u201d for information about these restrictions. See also Risk Factors - Capital Risks - Legal and Regulatory Restrictions May Prevent Us from Paying Dividends and Repurchasing Our Stock.\u201d\nDividends\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $178 million and $141 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments.\nDividends are paid quarterly on the Series A preferred stock. Dividends are paid semi-annually on MetLife, Inc.'s 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, until June 15, 2020 and, thereafter, will be paid quarterly. Dividends are paid semi-annually on the Series D preferred stock, in September and March until March 15, 2028 and, thereafter, will be paid quarterly. Dividends are paid quarterly on the Series E preferred stock.\nThe declaration and payment of common stock dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc.'s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nSee Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding common and preferred stock dividends declared subsequent to December 31, 2019.\nDividend Stopper\u201d Provisions in MetLife's Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\nMetLife, Inc.'s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures contain dividend stopper\u201d provisions under which MetLife, Inc. may not pay dividends on instruments junior to those instruments if payments have not been made on those instruments. Moreover, MetLife, Inc.'s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would limit the payment of dividends or interest on those instruments if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests ( Trigger Events\u201d), to an amount not greater than the net proceeds from sales of common stock and other specified instruments during a period preceding the dividend declaration date or the interest payment date, as applicable. If such proceeds were under the circumstances insufficient to make such payments on those instruments, the dividend stopper provisions affecting common stock (and preferred stock, as applicable) would come into effect.\nA Trigger Event\u201d would occur if:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the RBC ratio of MetLife's largest U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries' prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around March 1) with state insurance commissioners; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>at the end of a quarter ( Final Quarter End Test Date\u201d), consolidated GAAP net income for the four-quarter period ending two quarters before such quarter-end (the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date\u201d) is zero or a negative amount and the consolidated GAAP stockholders' equity, minus AOCI (the adjusted stockholders' equity amount\u201d), as of the Final Quarter End Test Date and the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, declined by 10% or more from (A) its level 10 quarters before the Final Quarter End Test Date (the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date\u201d), for Benchmark Quarter End Test Dates after August 4, 2017 (the date of the Separation), or (B) $49,282,000,000, the consolidated GAAP stockholders' equity, minus AOCI as of June 30, 2017 as reported on a pro forma basis reflecting the Separation in MetLife's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 9, 2017, for Benchmark Quarter End Test Dates prior to August 4, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Once a Trigger Event occurs for a Final Quarter End Test Date, the suspension of payments of dividends and interest (in the absence of sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities during specified periods) would continue until there is no Trigger Event at a subsequent Final Quarter End Test Date, and, if the test in the second paragraph above caused the Trigger Event, the adjusted stockholders' equity amount is no longer 10% or more below its level at the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date that is associated with the Trigger Event. In the case of successive Trigger Events, the suspension would continue until MetLife satisfies these conditions for each of the Trigger Events.\nThe junior subordinated debentures further provide that MetLife, Inc. may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, elect to defer payment of interest. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Any such elective deferral would trigger the dividend stopper provisions.\nFurther, MetLife, Inc. is a party to certain replacement capital covenants which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of the junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, Inc., with some limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such covenants.\nDebt Repayments\nSee Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt and the collateral financing arrangement, respectively, including:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, following regulatory approval, MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $67 million and $61 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes, which were reported in collateral financing arrangement on the consolidated balance sheets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In August 2018, MetLife, Inc. repaid at maturity the remaining $533 million of its 6.817% senior notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.\nIn June 2019, MetLife, Inc. redeemed for cash and canceled its \u00a3400 million aggregate principal amount 5.250% senior notes due June 2020 and the remaining $368 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% senior notes due February 2021.\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt including the FVO Brighthouse Common Stock exchange.\nSupport Agreements\nMetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an Obligor\u201d) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor has agreed to cause the applicable entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet such demands. See Note 5 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules.\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property and casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. For both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.8 billion. In the RIS business within the U.S. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at December 31, 2019, there were funding agreements totaling $123 million that could be put back to the Company.\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had received pledged cash collateral from counterparties of $6.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had pledged cash collateral to counterparties of $275 million and $283 million, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions.\nWe pledge collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements and advance agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurities Lending and Repurchase Agreements\nWe participate in a securities lending program and in short-term repurchase agreements whereby securities are loaned to unaffiliated financial institutions. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Through these arrangements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $19.7 billion and $19.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including a portion that may require the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLitigation\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions\nCash outflows for acquisitions and investments in strategic partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $32 million and $0, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at December 31, 2019:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\nOne Year to\nThree Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\nThree Years\nto Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>237,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions\n</td> <td>26,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>31,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitments\n</td> <td>12,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>19,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>669,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Liabilities\nInsurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. All estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. Because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented on the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. Additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $340.3 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $214.8 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP. See - Policyholder Account Balances.\u201d\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nSee Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. See - Insurance Liabilities\u201d regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\nAmounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $237.3 billion exceeds the liability amount of $192.6 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nPayables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nWe have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, FHLB of Boston short-term advance agreements and derivatives. As these transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table above. We also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019.\nDebt\nAmounts presented for debt include short-term debt, long-term debt, the collateral financing arrangement and junior subordinated debt securities, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented herein (i) do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) include future interest on such obligations for the period from January 1, 2020 through maturity; and (iii) do not include long-term debt relating to CSEs at December 31, 2019 as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. Future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at December 31, 2019 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from January 1, 2020 through maturity, except with respect to junior subordinated debt which was computed using the stated rates through the scheduled redemption dates as it is our expectation that such obligations will be redeemed as scheduled. Inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt securities through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by $7.7 billion. Pursuant to the collateral financing arrangement, MetLife, Inc. may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment Commitments\nTo enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. In the table above, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. As it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. Commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\u201d\nOperating Leases\nAs a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. Contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. However, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nOther obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. If the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. Items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $295 million were excluded as the timing of payment could not be reliably determined at December 31, 2019.\nSeparate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.\nWe also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at December 31, 2019.\nAdditionally, we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.\nMetLife, Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.'s access to liquidity.\nMetLife, Inc.'s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See - The Company - Rating Agencies.\u201d\nLiquidity\nFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.'s liquidity, see - The Company - Liquidity.\u201d\nCapital\nFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.'s capital, see - The Company - Capital.\u201d See also - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Common Stock Repurchases\u201d for information regarding MetLife, Inc.'s common stock repurchases.\nLiquid Assets\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies had $4.2 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $3.0 billion and $2.4 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $1.2 billion and $607 million were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and a collateral financing arrangement.\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Dividends from Subsidiaries.\u201d The cumulative earnings of certain active non-U.S. operations have historically been reinvested indefinitely in such non-U.S. operations. Following a post-Separation review of our capital needs, the Company repatriated $400 million of pre-2017 earnings in the second quarter of 2018. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we expect to repatriate future foreign earnings back to the U.S. with minimal or no additional U.S. tax. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and - Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Changes in Tax Laws or Interpretations of Such Laws Could Reduce Our Earnings and Materially Impact Our Operations by Increasing Our Corporate Taxes and Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers.\u201d\nSee - Executive Summary - Consolidated Company Outlook,\u201d for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies.\nMetLife, Inc. and Other MetLife Holding Companies Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets and Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets included in Free Cash Flow\nMetLife, Inc.'s sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow are summarized as follows.\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets Included in Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets Included in Free Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife, Inc.

There were no uses of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies to fund business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the description of liquidity and capital sources in - The Company - Summary of the Company's Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\u201d and - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Sources,\u201d MetLife, Inc.'s primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nMetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\nThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc.'s primary U.S. insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Permitted Without Approval (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Paid (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Permitted Without Approval (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Paid (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Permitted Without Approval (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Life Insurance Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General American Life Insurance Company (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during the relevant year without prior regulatory approval ( ordinary dividends\u201d).

Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. received cash returns of capital of $10 million and $87 million.\nThe dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary's prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including the FSA, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc.\nWe proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market.

Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock and certain of its other securities, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.\nIn addition to the description of liquidity and capital uses in - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Uses\u201d and - The Company - Contractual Obligations,\u201d MetLife, Inc.'s primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nAffiliated Capital and Debt Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $89 million and $778 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries.\nMetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, through credit agreements or otherwise to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements or to provide liquidity.

MetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nDuring 2019, overall sales increased compared to 2018 as improved sales in our U.S. Group Benefits business, as well as in Latin America and EMEA, more than offset lower sales in Japan. Positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio; however, investment yields declined and interest credited rates were higher. Underwriting experience was unfavorable compared to 2018 and results in both 2019 and 2018 included a charge due to the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review. In addition, our 2019 results benefited from certain tax settlements. A favorable change in net investment gains (losses) primarily reflects 2018 losses on the fair value option ( FVO\u201d) Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock ( FVO Brighthouse Common Stock\u201d) and higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities. An unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) was primarily the result of changes in key equity index levels, partially offset by a decline in interest rates.\nThe following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n_______________\n(1) Excludes Corporate & Other adjusted loss available to common shareholders of $401 million.\n(2) Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n Consolidated Results - Highlights Net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders up $739 million: \u2022 Favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $742 million ($586 million, net of income tax) \u2022 Unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of $223 million ($176 million, net of income tax) \u2022 Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders up $306 million (1) See - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results\u201d and - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures. Consolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings Highlights Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders up $306 million: \u2022 The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were benefits from certain tax settlements and higher net investment income due to growth in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher interest credited expense, unfavorable underwriting and the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review. \u2022 Our results for 2019 included the following: \u2022 unfavorable impact from our annual actuarial assumption review of $143 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $17 million, net of income tax, charge due to an increase in our incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) long-term care reserves, reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims \u2022 expenses associated with our previously announced unit cost initiative of $332 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $317 million tax benefit related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform \u2022 a $222 million benefit from the IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC, which was comprised of a $158 million tax benefit and a $64 million interest benefit \u2022 Our results for 2018 included the following: \u2022 a $349 million benefit from the IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC, which was comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit \u2022 favorable reserve adjustment of $62 million, net of income tax, relating to certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former joint venture in Japan \u2022 a $37 million, net of income tax, favorable net insurance adjustment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business \u2022 expenses associated with our previously announced unit cost initiative of $284 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $63 million, net of income tax, charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims \u2022 a $60 million, net of income tax, increase in litigation reserves \u2022 unfavorable impact from our annual actuarial assumption review of $42 million, net of income tax \nFor a more in-depth discussion of our consolidated results, see - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results,\u201d - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\u201d and - Results of Operations - Segment Results and Corporate & Other.\u201d\nConsolidated Company Outlook\nAt the December 2019 Investor Day, we introduced our Next Horizon Strategy which is founded on three pillars: (i) Focus\u201d - generate strong free cash flow by deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities, (ii) Simplify\u201d - simplify our business to deliver operational efficiency and an outstanding customer experience, and (iii) Differentiate\u201d - drive competitive advantage through our brand, scale, talent, and innovation. The pillars of our Next Horizon Strategy are the basis of our ability to create and deliver optimal shareholder value.\nWe continue to shift our business mix to protection-oriented and fee-based businesses. As a result, we expect our results to be less sensitive to interest rates. Assuming interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves, as of the year ended December 31, 2019, we expect the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 to be 65% to 75%, assuming a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate between 1.5% and 4.5%. We believe that free cash flow is a key determinant of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. We have returned approximately $16.0 billion to shareholders from 2016 through 2019 and we expect to generate approximately $20.0 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, while maintaining a $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion buffer of liquid assets at the holding companies.\nDespite the prolonged low interest rate environment, we continue to project adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d) other than foreign currency translation adjustments ( FCTA\u201d), of 12% to 14% over the near-term. This target reflects the completion of restructuring charges related to our unit cost improvement program in 2019 which we project will result in approximately $900 million of pre-tax expense margin expansion in 2020. We expect to maintain this margin by holding to a 12.3% direct expense ratio in 2020, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, while creating additional capacity to fund over $1.0 billion in incremental technology and innovation investments to accelerate our growth over the next five years.\nWhen making these and other projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. Additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury, SEC or the FASB may require us to revise these projections in future periods.\nOther Key Information\nArgentina Highly Inflationary\nThe inflation levels in Argentina have been elevated for several years. In the first half of 2018, Argentina's reported inflation rates began to increase dramatically and the Argentine central bank significantly increased interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Based on Argentina's reported inflation rates and trends, as of July 1, 2018, we designated Argentina as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. The application of highly inflationary accounting did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIndustry Trends\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition.\u201d\nWe have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. For example, MetLife is the largest provider of benefits to Mexican federal government personnel and public officials, however, the administration of President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico is implementing an austerity plan which, among other measures, has eliminated benefits such as major medical insurance and contributions to additional savings benefit insurance for such individuals. See Business - Regulation - Fiscal Measures\u201d and Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, events following the U.K. referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its withdrawal from the EU have contributed to global market volatility. These factors could contribute to weakening Gross Domestic Product growth, primarily in the U.K. and, to a lesser degree, in continental Europe and beyond. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the negotiations regarding future trade and other arrangements.

In addition, the possibility of government shutdowns or a failure to raise the debt ceiling, due to a policy impasse or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and liquidity.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board which had been tightening monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate and shrinking the balance sheet, now has lowered rates to sustain the economic expansion and has begun to expand its balance sheet once again to reduce liquidity issues in financing markets. The European Central Bank has resumed quantitative easing for as long as necessary and left its deposit interest rate unchanged at its historic low. In Japan, the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are maintaining stimulus measures in order to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. Such measures include the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate. Going forward, Japan's structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan's high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks. Further actions by central banks in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other developed and emerging economies, and may ultimately result in market volatility. We cannot predict with certainty the effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio or derivatives. See - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Sustained periods of low U.S. interest rates, may cause us to:\n \u2022 Reduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets ( gross margin\u201d); \n \u2022 Reinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio; \n \u2022 Increase our reserves or trigger loss recognition events related to policy liabilities, accelerate amortization of DAC and VOBA, and potentially impair intangible assets; \n \u2022 Reduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values; \n \u2022 Change our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and \n \u2022 Experience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.

In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) strategies, including the use of derivatives, and may take management actions such as:\n \u2022 Lowering interest crediting rates or adjusting the dividend scale on products; \n \u2022 Limiting or closing certain products to new sales to manage exposures; and \n \u2022 Shifting sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products.  Our ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive mitigation strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help mitigate unfavorable impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we expect adjusted earnings will continue to increase over the near term despite the sustained low U.S. interest rate environment.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Interest Rate Risk;\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities;\u201d and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures.\u201d\nLow Interest Rate Scenario\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to lower U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of a hypothetical low interest rate environment (the Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d) relative to the economic assumptions used for our insurance contracts (the Base Scenario\u201d) through 2022.\nThe Low Interest Rate Scenario assumes an immediate decline of U.S. interest rates for all maturities to 1.00% on January 1, 2020 and subsequent 10 basis point increases for maturities one year and longer on January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2022, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Low Interest Rate Scenario and Base Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant short-term and long-term interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low Interest Rate Scenario\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Scenario\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.61%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.65%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.72%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year U.S. Treasury\n</td> <td>1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.04%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses) and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives through 2022. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. For purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded all VA program derivatives. For information regarding our VA and non-VA program derivatives, see - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results.\u201d\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings through 2022. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income.\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses) and the adjusted earnings for certain segments, as well as Corporate & Other for the dates indicated:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Derivative Gains (Losses):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA Program Derivatives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Earnings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Group Benefits\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement and Income Solutions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property & Casualty\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia (Japan only)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate & Other\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjusted Earnings Impact\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegments and Corporate & Other\nThe primary drivers of the Low Interest Rate Scenario impacting our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, are summarized below. Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nFor additional information regarding account values subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d), and the yield on invested assets, see - Investments;\u201d - Policyholder Liabilities - Policyholder Account Balances;\u201d and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nU.S.\nGroup Benefits\nOur group life insurance products are primarily renewable term policies. This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Less than half of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates. Additionally, we experience gross margin compression from our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate risk for both products.\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions.\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nThis business contains both short and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nA significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. The Low Interest Rate Scenario does not assume any additional ALM actions we may take in our capital markets business.\nOur long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nProperty & Casualty\nOur products primarily consist of six-month and annual term renewable policies and do not have policyholder benefits linked to interest rates. This provides significant re-pricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nAsia\nOur Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded businesses outside of Japan given their insignificant U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nMetLife Holdings\nOur interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since most of our traditional life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. Although we are able mitigate gross margin compression by lowering interest crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies, these actions may be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees.\nOur annuity products experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these contracts are at their minimum crediting rate, and, therefore we use interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate gross margin compression.\nOur long-term care business experiences gross margin compression as we cannot reduce interest crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 7% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements, and our outstanding debt and preferred securities. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets is partially offset by the positive impact of lower interest expense on collateral financing and variable rate debt.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the preferred stock dividend impact is excluded and the impact on pension and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate & Other and not allocated across segments. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase, however, the impact is offset by corresponding returns on the fixed income plan assets resulting in lower expenses.\nCompetitive Pressures\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See Business - Competition.\u201d Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Several of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the capability to engage with the new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets and its impact on the capital position of many competitors will continue to strain the competitive environment. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See Business - Regulation.\u201d We believe that the aforementioned factors have highlighted financial strength, technology efficiency, and organizational agility as the most significant differentiators and, as a result, we believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment.\nRegulatory Developments\nIn the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. See Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\u201d Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products and, in some states, instituted a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions. See Business - Regulation,\u201d Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases, and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,\u201d Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Capital - Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.\u201d\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iv)\n</td> <td>investment impairments;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(v)\n</td> <td>estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vi)\n</td> <td>measurement of goodwill and related impairment;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(vii)\n</td> <td>measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(viii)\n</td> <td>measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ix)\n</td> <td>liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 6.75%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $17.8 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. Amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the variable and universal life and annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General account investment return\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Separate account investment return\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment/Net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In-force/Persistency\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder dividends, expense and other\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(233\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2019 consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Net increase in amortization of $106 million associated with net investment/net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB, primarily driven by the following: \n - An increase in amortization of $25 million from net derivative gains from freestanding derivatives hedging the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million from net derivative losses resulting from the increases in variable annuity guarantee obligations. \n - A decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million associated with gains from GMIB hedges and the decreases in GMIB obligations. \n - Net increase in amortization of approximately $100 million from other investment activities. \n \u2022 Net increase in general account investment return mostly due to net investment income assumption unlocking and an update to the yield curve for market value adjustment.  Significant items contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2018 consisted of the following:\n \u2022 Net increase in amortization of $215 million associated with net investment/net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB, primarily driven by the following: \n - An increase in amortization of $90 million from net derivative gains from freestanding derivatives hedging the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of approximately $30 million from net derivative losses resulting from the increases in variable annuity guarantee obligations. \n - An increase in amortization of approximately $35 million associated with gains from GMIB hedges and the decreases in GMIB obligations. \n - Net increase in amortization of approximately $100 million from the annual actuarial assumption review and other investment activities.  Our DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized. The increase in unrealized investment gains (losses) decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by $1.5 billion in 2019. The decrease in unrealized investment gains (losses) increased the DAC and VOBA balance by $521 million in 2018. See Notes 5 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized investment gains (losses).\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Impairments\nOne of the significant estimates related to fixed maturity securities AFS is our impairment evaluation. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. Our review of each security for OTTI includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. Accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected.\nAdditionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Factors we consider in the OTTI evaluation process are described in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.\nThe impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads decreased as compared to prior periods. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Changes in Balance Sheet Carrying Value At December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Policyholder Account Balances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DAC and VOBA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100% increase in our credit spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50% decrease in our credit spread\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of the effectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we tested the MetLife Holdings life insurance reporting unit for impairment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 43% and, therefore, the reporting unit was not impaired. If we had assumed that the discount rate was 100 basis points higher than the discount rate used, the estimated fair value of the MetLife Holdings life insurance reporting unit would have been higher than the carrying value by approximately 22%. This reporting unit consists of operations relating to products and businesses we no longer actively market. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit was $887 million.\nWe also performed our annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2019 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2019. We concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nWe apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2018, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $100 million and an increase of $100 million, respectively, in 2019. This considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.\nWe determine the discount rates used to value the Company's pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2018, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $97 million and an increase of $94 million, respectively, in 2019. This considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee also Notes 1 and 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. For further information, see Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisition of PetFirst\nIn December 2019, the Company and PetFirst Healthcare, LLC ( PetFirst\u201d), a fast-growing pet health insurance administrator, entered into a definitive agreement under which MetLife will acquire PetFirst. The transaction closed in January 2020.\nAcquisition of Willing\nIn November 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Bequest, Inc. ( Willing\u201d), a leading digital estate planning service. This transaction brings new digital capabilities to the Company and reinforces its commitment to providing simple and easy-to-use benefits that respond to consumer needs.\nPending Disposition of MetLife Hong Kong\nFor information regarding the Company's definitive agreement to sell, MetLife Hong Kong, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisposition of MetLife Afore\nFor information regarding the Company's 2018 disposition of MetLife Afore, S.A. de C.V. ( MetLife Afore\u201d), its pension fund management business in Mexico, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeparation of Brighthouse\nIn 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Brighthouse\u201d) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the Separation\u201d). For information regarding the Separation, the Company's 2018 sale of the FVO Brighthouse Common Stock, and ongoing transactions between MetLife and Brighthouse, see Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nBusiness Overview. Overall sales for 2019 increased over 2018 levels reflecting higher sales in the majority of our businesses. In our U.S. segment, sales increased in our Group Benefits business as a result of strong sales in both our core and voluntary products. In our RIS business, sales were slightly lower, as higher funding agreement issuances and structured settlement sales were more than offset by lower sales of pension risk transfers and stable value products. Sales in our Asia segment decreased as a result of lower sales in Japan, a large group case in Australia in 2018, and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong, partially offset by higher sales in Korea. Sales in our Latin America segment improved as a result of higher sales in Mexico, Brazil and Chile. In our EMEA segment, sales improved as a result of increases in Turkey, the U.K. and Egypt.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>5,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>18,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>1,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>69,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>42,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>6,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(3,358\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,254\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>2,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>13,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>62,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before provision for income tax\n</td> <td>6,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>5,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to MetLife, Inc.\n</td> <td>5,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nDuring 2019, net income (loss) increased $781 million from 2018, primarily driven by a favorable change in net investment gains (losses) and an increase in adjusted earnings, which includes benefits from certain tax settlements, partially offset by an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses).\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within contractholder-directed equity securities and fair value option securities ( FVO Securities\u201d) (collectively, Unit-linked and FVO Securities\u201d), contractholder-directed equity securities supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities ( Unit-linked investments\u201d), which do not qualify as separate account assets. Returns on these Unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances.\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. We continuously review and refine our strategy and ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses). The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as VA program derivatives.\u201d All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as non-VA program derivatives.\u201d The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange rate\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>(403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-VA embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(162\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risks in embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other risks in embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivatives hedging embedded derivatives\n</td> <td>(840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total VA program derivatives\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net derivative gains (losses)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $252 million ($199 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to a favorable change in interest rate impact due to long-term U.S. interest rates decreasing in 2019 and increasing in 2018, favorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps, options and total rate of return swaps. In addition, credit spreads narrowed in 2019 and widened in 2018, favorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in 2019 versus 2018, unfavorably impacting foreign currency forwards and swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. In addition, key equity markets increasing in 2019 versus decreasing in 2018 unfavorably impacted equity options acquired primarily as part of our macro hedge program. There was also a change in the value of the underlying assets, unfavorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the items being hedged.\nThe unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $475 million ($375 million, net of income tax). This was due to an unfavorable change of $249 million ($197 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $235 million ($186 million, net of income tax) in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, net of market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a favorable change of $9 million, ($7 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.\nThe aforementioned $235 million ($186 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change reflects a $1.1 billion ($898 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a $902 million ($713 million, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.\nThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Long-term U.S. interest rates decreased in 2019 and increased in 2018, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate decreased 75 basis points in 2019 and increased 30 basis points in 2018. \n \u2022 Key equity index levels increased in 2019 and decreased in 2018, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index increased 29% in 2019 and decreased 6% in 2018.  The aforementioned $9 million ($7 million, net of income tax) favorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflects actuarial assumption updates and a combination of factors, which include fees deducted from accounts, changes in the benefit base, premiums, lapses, withdrawals and deaths.\nThe aforementioned $249 million ($197 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from an unfavorable change of $137 million, before income tax, related to model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees in addition to an unfavorable change of $112 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when the driver moves in the opposite direction.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses). The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $742 million ($586 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects 2018 losses on FVO Brighthouse Common Stock comprised of a change in fair value through date of disposal and loss on disposal, as well as mark-to-market losses on equity securities in 2018, both of which are measured at fair value through net income. Additionally, there were higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities AFS in 2019 versus 2018. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses.\nDivested Businesses. Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $18 million ($6 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $104 million ($84 million, net of income tax) in 2019 from a loss of $122 million ($90 million, net of income tax) in 2018. Included in this increase was an increase in total revenues of $115 million, before income tax, and an increase in total expenses of $97 million, before income tax. Divested businesses primarily include activity related to the Separation and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong.\nTaxes. Our 2019 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 13%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and the impact from the definitive agreement to sell MetLife Hong Kong. Our 2018 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 19%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, the settlement of tax audits and a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent. These tax benefits were partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate, U.S. Tax Reform, a non-deductible loss incurred on the mark-to-market and disposition of FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and a tax adjustment in Chile.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for 2019 include a $201 million ($162 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $31 million loss ($27 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $201 million charge, $49 million ($37 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $152 million ($125 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $201 million charge that was included in adjusted earnings was $179 million ($143 million, net of income tax).\nThe $31 million loss ($27 million, net of income tax) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives line in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the MetLife Holdings segment, driven by the projection of closed block results and economic updates. The breakdown of total 2019 results is summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Economic assumption updates resulted in a net charge of $151 million ($117 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in biometric assumptions resulted in a net charge of $21 million ($15 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in a favorable impact of $16 million ($14 million, net of income tax). \n \u2022 Changes in operational assumptions, most notably related to closed block projections, resulted in a net charge of $44 million ($44 million, net of income tax).  Results for 2018 include a $358 million ($272 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $131 million loss ($94 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $358 million charge, $20 million ($20 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $338 million ($252 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $358 million charge that is included in adjusted earnings is $53 million ($42 million, net of income tax).\nCertain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2019 include a $22 million ($17 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2019 increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. Certain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2018 include a $79 million ($63 million, net of income tax) charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments are included in adjusted earnings.\nAdjusted Earnings. As more fully described in - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,\u201d we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis should not be viewed as substitutes for net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders increased $306 million, net of income tax, to $5.8 billion, net of income tax, for 2019 from $5.5 billion, net of income tax, for 2018.\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

- Adjusted Earnings\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were benefits from certain tax settlements and higher net investment income due to growth in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher interest credited expense, unfavorable underwriting and the unfavorable impact of our annual actuarial assumption review.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $78 million negative impact on adjusted earnings for 2019 compared to 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. We benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of our Asia and U.S. segments resulted in higher net investment income. However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expenses on certain insurance-related liabilities. Higher fee income in our Asia, Latin America and EMEA segments was largely offset by lower fee income in our MetLife Holdings segment. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions, which was offset by higher DAC capitalization. A decrease in expenses was primarily due to the 2019 abatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by higher DAC amortization, resulted in a $206 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively affected by lower yields on fixed income securities, lower income from derivatives and lower returns on real estate investments. In addition, lower earnings from our securities lending program resulted primarily from lower margins and balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher returns on FVO Securities, equity-linked notes and hedge funds. The decrease in investment yields was more than offset by an increase in asset-based fee income and lower DAC amortization in MetLife Holdings, both driven by higher equity returns, and a decrease in average interest credited expenses, primarily in Asia. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $44 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Unfavorable underwriting resulted in a $121 million decrease in adjusted earnings primarily as a result of higher claims and lapses in our Asia segment, less favorable mortality in our MetLife Holdings and Latin America segments, and an increase in non-catastrophe claim costs and adverse prior year development in our Property & Casualty business, partially offset by favorable claims experience and favorable mortality, primarily in our Group Benefits business, and lower catastrophe losses. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $101 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to less favorable assumption changes in our MetLife Holdings segment in 2019. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in 2019 and 2018, resulted in an $8 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nInterest Expense on Debt. Interest expense on debt decreased by $82 million, primarily due to the exchange of senior notes for FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and the redemption of senior notes for cash in 2018, partially offset by a premium paid in excess of the debt principal and accrued and unpaid interest on senior notes redeemed in 2019.\nExpenses. Expenses increased compared to 2018, which resulted in a $53 million decrease in adjusted earnings, primarily due to higher costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, including the continued investment in our unit cost initiative and a prior period reduction of a litigation reserve in Argentina, partially offset by lower legal expenses, interest on uncertain tax positions and employee-related costs, as well as a decline in costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives.\nTaxes. Our 2019 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 10%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income and tax credits, the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2018 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 16%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income, tax credits, the settlement of tax audits and a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and a tax adjustment in Chile.\nSegment Results and Corporate & Other\nU.S.\nBusiness Overview. Sales increased compared to 2018, primarily driven by our Group Benefits business, as a result of strong sales in both our core and voluntary products. In our RIS business, sales were slightly lower than 2018, as higher funding agreement issuances and structured settlement sales were more than offset by lower sales of pension risk transfers (driven by a large transaction in the second quarter of 2018) and stable value products. Changes in premiums for the RIS business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. In our Property & Casualty business, sales were relatively flat compared to 2018. In addition, the number of exposures decreased from 2018, reflecting management actions to improve the quality of the business.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>7,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>35,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>26,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(449\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>477\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>4,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>32,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. The impact of positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions in both 2019 and 2018 and funding agreement issuances in 2019 resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets, interest credited expenses on long-duration liabilities increased. Higher volume-related, premium tax and direct expenses, driven by business growth, were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses. This net increase in expenses, partially offset by the decrease due to the 2019 abatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA, was more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $111 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased, primarily due to lower income from derivatives, lower yields on fixed income securities and real estate investments, lower returns on private equity funds and lower earnings from our securities lending program, primarily from lower margins and balances. These decreases were partially offset by higher prepayment fees and higher yields on mortgage loans. In addition, net investment income increased as a result of the impact of an increased crediting rate on interest on economic capital. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in an increase in our average interest credited rates on deposit-type liabilities, partially offset by lower rates on our long-duration liabilities, which drove a net increase in interest credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $176 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable claims experience and the impact of growth in our Group Benefits business resulted in a $95 million increase in adjusted earnings. This was primarily driven by lower claim severity, favorable renewal results and an increase in recoveries in our group disability business. In both our accident & health and individual disability businesses, the impact of growth in the business and favorable claims experience also contributed to the increase in adjusted earnings. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable dental results, driven by an increase in utilization and the impact of unfavorable prior period development in 2019. Favorable mortality, driven by claims experience in our term life business, primarily due to lower severity in 2019 and the unfavorable impact of the influenza virus in 2018, partially offset by less favorable mortality in our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, income annuities and specialized benefit resources businesses, resulted in a $42 million increase in adjusted earnings. In our Property & Casualty business, adjusted earnings decreased $77 million, the result of higher non-catastrophe claims costs, driven by higher severities in both our auto and homeowner businesses and a net increase in frequencies, with an increase in our auto business being mostly offset in our homeowner business, coupled with higher losses in the commercial business. In addition, adverse prior year development, due to auto non-catastrophe claims costs impacting the estimate of ultimate losses for prior accident years, predominantly for casualty coverages, contributed to this decrease. These unfavorable results were partially offset by lower catastrophe costs. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities recorded in both 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $48 million increase to adjusted earnings, which included the impact of favorable insurance adjustments resulting from enhancements to our claim-related processes, and the 2018 favorable net insurance adjustments resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business.\nAsia\nBusiness Overview. Sales decreased compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales of foreign currency-denominated annuity products in Japan, a large group case in Australia in the prior period, and the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong, partially offset by higher sales in Korea due to higher sales of retirement products and a new life product launch.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>3,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>12,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>5,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(1,913\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>3,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>10,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $29 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Asia's premiums, fees and other revenues decreased slightly as compared to 2018, mainly driven by the pending disposition of MetLife Hong Kong and a decrease in premiums from yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by a related decline in policyholder benefits, as well as growth in accident & health and foreign currency-denominated life products in Japan. Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets, which improved net investment income. The increase in net investment income was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expenses on certain insurance liabilities. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth improved adjusted earnings by $122 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment results were favorably impacted by higher derivative income, earnings from our operating joint venture in China (mainly driven by a regulatory change), returns from hedge funds, private equities and real estate investments, as well as higher yields on mortgage loans. These increases were partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities supporting U.S. dollar-denominated products sold in Japan, and fixed income securities in Bangladesh and Korea. In addition, lower interest credited rates improved adjusted earnings. The changes in market factors discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $102 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Higher claims and lapses primarily in Japan and Korea decreased adjusted earnings by $99 million. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net increase of $67 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in 2019 and 2018, resulted in a slight increase in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. Expenses increased as compared to 2018, which reduced adjusted earnings by $5 million. Various tax items in both 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $9 million increase in adjusted earnings. Results for 2019 include a charge of $8 million related to a withholding tax provision on dividends from our operating joint venture in China and a $6 million benefit due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return.\nLatin America\nBusiness Overview. Total sales for Latin America increased compared to 2018, driven by higher group and individual medical sales in Mexico, higher universal and variable life sales in Mexico and Chile, and higher dental and life sales in Brazil, partially offset by lower retirement sales in Chile.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>5,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>2,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(396\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $27 million for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the weakening of the Argentine and Chilean pesos against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Latin America experienced growth across several lines of business primarily within Chile and Mexico. This growth resulted in increased premiums and policy fee income, which was partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows, primarily from Chile and Argentina, partially offset by Mexico, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. Although business growth drove an increase in commissions, net of DAC capitalization, this was more than offset by decreases in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities and other variable expenses. The combined impact of the items affecting business growth, including higher DAC amortization, increased adjusted earnings by $62 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased, driven by higher yields on FVO Securities, due to the favorable impact of equity markets on our Chilean encaje and fixed income securities in Argentina, Chile and Mexico. These increases in investment yields were partially offset by lower private equity returns in Chile and Mexico, as well as lower yields on mortgage loans and lower derivative income, both in Chile. The changes in market factors discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $61 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable underwriting resulted in a $23 million decrease to adjusted earnings primarily driven by higher claims experience in Mexico. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $18 million in adjusted earnings. In addition, refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in 2019 and 2018, primarily in Brazil, resulted in a $12 million increase to adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. A $60 million increase in expenses was primarily the result of a prior period reduction of a litigation reserve in Argentina, along with various other expense increases. Adjusted earnings increased by $13 million due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return. Other tax-related adjustments in 2019 and 2018, primarily related to foreign exchange volatility in Argentina, resulted in a net decrease in adjusted earnings of $29 million. Results for 2018 also include tax expenses of $24 million driven by a $17 million tax charge related to a tax adjustment in Chile and a $5 million tax charge in Colombia to establish a deferred tax liability due to a change in tax status.\nEMEA\nBusiness Overview. Sales increased compared to 2018 primarily driven by increases in our credit life business in Turkey and in our employee benefits business in the U.K. and Egypt.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>1,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(468\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of negative VOBA\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>2,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $22 million for 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira, the euro, the British pound and the Polish zloty. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth. Growth from our accident & health and credit life businesses in Turkey and across several European markets, partially offset by a decrease in our pensions business in Romania due to regulatory changes, increased adjusted earnings by $10 million.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, impacted our results favorably by $4 million primarily due to higher investment yields in Turkey and Ukraine.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Unfavorable underwriting decreased adjusted earnings by $5 million as a result of unfavorable experience in (i) our credit life business in Turkey and (ii) across several businesses in European markets (primarily our employee benefits business in the U.K.), partially offset by favorable experience in our employee benefits and accident & health businesses in the Gulf region. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net increase of $10 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance-related assets and liabilities that were recorded in 2019 and 2018 resulted in an $8 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes. Adjusted earnings decreased by $6 million, primarily driven by higher expenses in Europe due to transformation costs and regulatory fees, partially offset by lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives. Adjusted earnings increased by $6 million due to reduced tax charges as a result of recently issued tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform and the filing of the Company's 2018 U.S. tax return, partially offset by the prior period release of provisions arising from the finalization of historical corporate tax filings and changes in business mix among tax jurisdictions.\nMetLife Holdings\nBusiness Overview. Our MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses, previously included in our former retail business, that we no longer actively market in the United States. We anticipate an average decline in premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% per year from expected business run-off. A significant portion of our adjusted earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by movements in the market, surrenders, deposits, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment, and we expect the related reserves to grow as this block matures. As of December 31, 2019, our future policyholder benefit liability for our long-term care business was $12.5 billion.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>1,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>5,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>10,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>6,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest credited to policyholder account balances\n</td> <td>905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>9,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth. Negative net flows from our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life deposits resulted in lower fee income. Lower net investment income, resulting from a reduced invested asset base, primarily in fixed income securities, also decreased adjusted earnings. The reduced invested asset base was primarily the result of the negative net flows in our deferred annuities and life businesses. The decline was partially offset by invested asset growth from our long-term care business. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $103 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. In our deferred annuity business, higher equity returns drove an increase in asset-based fee income and lower DAC amortization, increasing adjusted earnings. Investment yields decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixed income securities and lower returns on real estate investments. The decline in investment yields was partially offset by increased prepayment fees and higher returns on hedge funds. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $17 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review, and Other Insurance Adjustments. Adjusted earnings decreased $47 million, primarily driven by less favorable underwriting in our traditional life business. The impact in 2019 and 2018 of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $160 million in adjusted earnings. Changes mainly in mortality, and economic and operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, were less favorable in 2019. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in 2019 and 2018 resulted in a $62 million decrease in adjusted earnings. This includes a 2019 charge due to an increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves, reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims, as well as the following 2018 refinements: (i) a favorable reserve adjustment relating to certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former joint venture in Japan; (ii) favorable reserve adjustments resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; and (iii) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims.\nExpenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $114 million due to declines in employee-related costs and lower operational expenses as a result of enterprise-wide initiatives.\nCorporate & Other\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Universal life and investment-type product policy fees\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted revenues\n</td> <td>651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization of DAC\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of DAC and VOBA\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total adjusted expenses\n</td> <td>2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>(1,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(825\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings\n</td> <td>(223\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below presents adjusted earnings available to common shareholders by source:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense on debt\n</td> <td>(978\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,076\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate initiatives and projects\n</td> <td>(563\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(405\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(330\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income tax (expense) benefit and other tax-related items\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>(178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(401\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Activities. Adjusted earnings from business activities increased $23 million. This was primarily related to improved results from certain of our businesses.\nNet Investment Income. Variability in equity market results increased returns on both FVO Securities and equity-linked notes. In addition, lower losses on tax credit partnerships favorably impacted net investment income. These increases were partially offset by decreased income on fixed income securities, mortgage loans and lower returns on private equities and real estate investments, resulting in an increase of $21 million in net investment income.\nInterest Expense on Debt. Interest expense on debt decreased by $77 million, primarily due to the exchange of senior notes for FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and the redemption of senior notes for cash in 2018, partially offset by a premium paid in excess of the debt principal and accrued and unpaid interest on senior notes redeemed in 2019.\nCorporate Initiatives and Projects. Adjusted earnings decreased $125 million due to higher expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects, most notably, costs associated with the continued investment in our unit cost initiative, partially offset by lower costs associated with certain other enterprise-wide initiatives.\nProvision for Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Other Tax-Related Items. A favorable change in Corporate & Other's effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, 2019 and 2018 include benefits from the settlement of tax audits related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. The 2018 provision for income tax (expense) benefit and other tax related items also included a tax benefit from a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent and a reduction in adjusted earnings related to certain tax impacts on tax credit partnership investments.\nOther. Adjusted earnings increased $30 million, primarily as a result of lower interest expenses on certain tax positions, lower legal expenses and declines in various other expenses, partially offset by a loss related to the sale of a run-off business that was previously reinsured, as well as increases in certain corporate-related expenses.\nPreferred Stock Dividends. Preferred stock dividends increased $37 million as a result of the issuance of MetLife, Inc.'s 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D ( Series D preferred stock\u201d) and MetLife, Inc.'s 5.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E ( Series E preferred stock\u201d) in 2018.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investment Risk Committee and Asset-Liability Steering Committee review and monitor investment risk limits and tolerances.\nWe are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\n \u2022 credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest; \n \u2022 interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; \n \u2022 liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; \n \u2022 market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher OTTI. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed income investments and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; \n \u2022 currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and \n \u2022 real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers, tenants and our joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, changes in market interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions. \nWe manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by the Investment Risk Committee, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies which are reviewed and approved by the Asset-Liability Steering Committee. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain NGEs of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk.\nWe enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determines that a credit event has occurred.\nWe use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging, which gives us more flexibility in managing our credit exposures. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.\nCurrent Environment\nAs a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, as well as the monetary policy of central banks around the world. See - Industry Trends - Financial and Economic Environment.\u201d Measures taken by central banks, including with respect to the level of interest rates, may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. The current environment continues to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities AFS if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as perpetual hybrid securities,\u201d have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or Tier 1 capital\u201d and perpetual deferrable securities, or Upper Tier 2 capital\u201d).\nRedeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities AFS. These securities, which are commonly referred to as capital securities,\u201d primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.\nValuation of Securities. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services' use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities AFS were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2019.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, new transaction types and markets are reviewed and approved to ensure that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. Senior management oversees the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing.\nWe review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management's knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. We ensure that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as consensus pricing,\u201d are representative of estimated fair value by considering such pricing relative to our knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio.\nWe also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management's best estimate is used.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three-level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets.\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Maturity\nSecurities AFS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Equity\nSecurities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>287,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant other observable inputs\n</td> <td>287,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent pricing sources\n</td> <td>15,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques\n</td> <td>2,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Independent broker quotations\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant unobservable inputs\n</td> <td>18,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total estimated fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy.\nThe majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors at December 31, 2019: foreign corporate securities, U.S. corporate securities and RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $4.0 billion, or 26%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and by an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3.\nSee - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities - Valuation of Securities\u201d for further information regarding the composition of fair value pricing sources for securities. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities and continuous gross unrealized losses.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality - Ratings\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called NAIC designations.\u201d If no designation is available from the NAIC, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. The NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities AFS, except for certain non-agency RMBS and CMBS as described below. Rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody's Investor Service ( Moody's\u201d), S&P, Fitch Ratings ( Fitch\u201d), Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best Company ( A.M. Best\u201d), Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC ( Morningstar\u201d). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS, and CMBS. The NAIC's objective with the revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS and CMBS was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC's present methodology is to evaluate non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available. NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using the revised NAIC methodologies, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair

Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nThe majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody's, S&P or Fitch; and were designated NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ( Alt-A\u201d) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.\nHistorically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).\nABS\nOur ABS portfolio is diversified by collateral type and issuer.

The most significant increase in OTTI losses was in foreign government securities, which comprised $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. An increase of $72 million in OTTI losses was concentrated in Argentine foreign government securities and was due to the weakening of the Argentine peso and issuer specific concerns.\nFuture Impairments\nFuture impairments on fixed maturity securities AFS will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings, and collateral valuation. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, credit losses may be incurred in upcoming periods.

We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans and impaired mortgage loans.\nWe review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.\nLoan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 55% at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.4x and 2.5x at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 47% and 46% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nMortgage Loan Valuation Allowances. Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.\nThe determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new guidance to be adopted in 2020 regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored and activity in and balances of the valuation allowance as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nReal estate and real estate joint ventures is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate, and to a lesser extent joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as a runoff portfolio. The carrying values of real estate and real estate joint ventures was $10.7 billion and $9.7 billion, or 2.2% and 2.1% of cash and invested assets, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nImpairments recognized on real estate and real estate joint ventures were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no impairments for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration.\nGeographical diversification: Of our real estate investments, excluding funds, 61% were located in the United States, with the remaining 39% located outside the United States, at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in Japan, California and Washington, D.C. were 34%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at December 31, 2019. Real estate funds were 24% of our real estate investments at December 31, 2019. The majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the United States.\nProperty type diversification: Real estate and real estate joint venture investments by property type are categorized by sector as follows at:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate funds\n</td> <td>2,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail\n</td> <td>1,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Apartment\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land\n</td> <td>669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hotel\n</td> <td>599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial\n</td> <td>393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agriculture\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total real estate and real estate joint ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests was $7.7 billion and $6.6 billion, which included $575 million and $634 million of hedge funds, respectively. Other limited partnership interests were 1.6% and 1.5% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds.\nOther Invested Assets\nThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships\n</td> <td>1,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Annuities funding structured settlement claims\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Direct financing leases\n</td> <td>1,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leveraged leases\n</td> <td>1,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Operating joint ventures\n</td> <td>838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FHLB common stock\n</td> <td>809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Funds withheld\n</td> <td>470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of cash and invested assets\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Notes 1, 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, direct financing and leveraged leases, annuities funding structured settlement claims, FHLB common stock, operating joint ventures and funds withheld.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding gains (losses) on disposals of, and impairments of, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, and leveraged lease impairment losses.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new guidance to be adopted in 2020 regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including direct financing and leveraged leases.\nDerivatives\nDerivative Risks\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\n \u2022 A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks. \n \u2022 Information about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2019 and 2018. \n \u2022 The statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedge relationships for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures - Hedging Activities\u201d for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.\nThe valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nDerivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2019 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At December 31, 2019, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curves. Other significant inputs, which are observable, include equity index levels, equity volatility and the swap yield curves. We validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations.\nThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives, percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, and the primary drivers of observable gain (loss) are summarized as follows:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) recognized in net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($108)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approximate percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable inputs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary drivers of observable gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increases in interest rates on new interest rate total return swaps and increases in certain equity index levels on equity derivatives.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Approximate percentage of gain (loss) attributable to unobservable inputs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.\nCredit Risk\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.\nOur policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps at:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Default Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nNotional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nNotional\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nFair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gains (losses) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) for credit default swaps as follows:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Default Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nLosses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nGains\n(Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nGains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nLosses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nGains\n(Losses)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Written (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps.  The favorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of $380 million was due to certain credit spreads on certain credit default swaps used as replications narrowing in the current period as compared to widening in the prior period.\nThe maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nSee - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates - Derivatives\u201d for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nWe maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as committed facilities, with various financial institutions. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of such arrangements, the classification of expenses on such credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these credit and committed facilities. See also - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Sources - Global Funding Sources - Credit and Committed Facilities.\u201d\nCollateral for Securities Lending, Third-Party Custodian Administered Repurchase Programs and Derivatives\nWe participate in a securities lending program and third-party custodian administered repurchase programs in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our securities lending program and repurchase agreement transactions, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangements and associated liabilities.\nSecurities lending: Periodically we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $0 and $78 million at estimated fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThird-party custodian administered repurchase programs: We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities AFS to unaffiliated financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the unaffiliated financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was $85 million and $78 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was $90 million and $84 million, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives: We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We receive non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Liquidity and Capital Uses - Pledged Collateral\u201d and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.\nLease Commitments\nAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nSee Guarantees\u201d in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nWe enter into the following additional commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Net Investment Income\u201d and Net Investment Gains (Losses)\u201d in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, and gains and losses from such investments. See also - Investments - Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\u201d and - Investments - Mortgage Loans\u201d for information on our investments in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. See - Investments - Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\u201d and - Investments - Other Limited Partnership Interests\u201d for information on our partnership investments.\nOther than the commitments disclosed in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. For further information on commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Contractual Obligations.\u201d\nInsolvency Assessments\nSee Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see - Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future.\nWe periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. We also use hedging, reinsurance and other risk management activities to mitigate financial market volatility.\nSee Business - Regulation - Insurance Regulation - Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis\u201d for information regarding required analyses of the adequacy of statutory reserves of our insurance operations.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nWe establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, - Industry Trends - Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment - Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d and - Variable Annuity Guarantees.\u201d A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate & Other) follows.\nU.S.\nAmounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities, as well as property and casualty policies. For group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. For group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various interest rate derivative positions. The components of future policy benefits related to our property and casualty policies are liabilities for unpaid claims, estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analysis of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nAsia\nFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident & health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower than expected yields, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\nLatin America\nFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in Chile, Mexico and Argentina and traditional life contracts mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. There are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in Mexico. There is limited interest rate crediting flexibility on the immediate annuity and traditional life liabilities. As a result, sustained periods of lower than expected yields could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Other factors impacting these liabilities are actual mortality resulting in higher than expected benefit payments and actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income.\nEMEA\nFuture policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident & health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\nMetLife Holdings\nFuture policy benefits for the life insurance business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. We routinely evaluate our reinsurance programs, which may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various interest rate derivative positions to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance. Other future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. In addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance.\nCorporate & Other\nFuture policy benefits primarily include liabilities for other reinsurance business.\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nPolicyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See - Industry Trends - Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment - Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d and - Variable Annuity Guarantees.\u201d See also Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment follows.\nU.S.\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs.\nGroup Benefits\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Group Benefits:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held largely for investment-type products mainly funding agreements and also include postretirement benefits and corporate owned life insurance to fund non-qualified benefit programs for executives. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) LIBOR. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as interest rate caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for RIS:\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsia\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Asia:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life & Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLatin America\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products and universal life products in Mexico and Chile, and deferred annuities in Brazil. Some products in Chile and some of the deferred annuities in Brazil are Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. Many of the other liabilities have minimum credited rate guarantees, which could adversely impact liabilities and earnings in a sustained low interest rate environment.\nEMEA\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuities, pension products, and Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in many of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\nMetLife Holdings\nLife policyholder account balances in this segment are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies, and funding agreements. For annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, non-life contingent income annuities, and embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantees. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, for our other products, policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for the MetLife Holdings segment:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate\n</td> <td>Account\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Account\nValue at\nGuarantee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 0% but less than 2%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equal to or greater than 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nVariable Annuity Guarantees\nWe issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the life-contingent portion of GMWBs, elective GMIB annuitizations, and the life contingent portion of GMIBs that require annuitization when the account balance goes to zero. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At the end of each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMABs, the non-life contingent portion of GMWBs and certain non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below presents the carrying value for guarantees at:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Future Policy\nBenefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Policyholder\nAccount Balances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMDB\n</td> <td>335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMIB\n</td> <td>756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $147 million and $263 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged.\nThe carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.\nAs discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. We continue to diversify the concentration of income benefits in our portfolio by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities.\nThe sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported on the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, Unit-linked investments that do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.\nGMDBs\nWe offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at December 31, 2019:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Account Value (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia & EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return of premium or five to seven year step-up\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual step-up\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Roll-up and step-up combination\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Total account value excludes $649 million for contracts with no GMDBs. The Company's annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantees are not mutually exclusive.  Based on total account value, less than 19% of our GMDBs included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step-up or roll-up and step-up combination products at December 31, 2019. We expect the above GMDB risk profile to be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future.\nLiving Benefit Guarantees\nThe table below presents our living benefit guarantees based on total account values at December 31, 2019:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Account Value (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asia & EMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MetLife Holdings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMIB\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB - non-life contingent (2)\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMWB - life-contingent\n</td> <td>3,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GMAB\n</td> <td>2,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Total account value excludes $24.2 billion for contracts with no living benefit guarantees. The Company's annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantee amounts are not mutually exclusive. \n (2) The Asia and EMEA segments include the non-life contingent portion of the GMWB total account value of $1.2 billion with a guarantee at annuitization.  In terms of total account value, GMIBs are our most significant living benefit guarantee. Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business. We stopped selling GMIBs in February 2016.\nThe table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at December 31, 2019:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\nAccount Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7-year setback, 2.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7-year setback, 1.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>964\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year setback, 1.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>4,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 1.0% interest rate\n</td> <td>8,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 0.5% interest rate\n</td> <td>1,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection.\nAdditionally, 42% of the $21.5 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of December 31, 2019. These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques reduce or eliminate the need for us to manage the funds' volatility through hedging or reinsurance.\nOur GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of December 31, 2019, only 22% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of four years.\nOnce eligible for annuitization, contractholders would", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

MetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See Business - Segments and Corporate & Other\u201d and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate & Other. Management continues to evaluate the Company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nDuring 2019, overall sales increased compared to 2018 as improved sales in our U.S. Group Benefits business, as well as in Latin America and EMEA, more than offset lower sales in Japan. Positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio; however, investment yields declined and interest credited rates were higher. Underwriting experience was unfavorable compared to 2018 and results in both 2019 and 2018 included a charge due to the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review. In addition, our 2019 results benefited from certain tax settlements. A favorable change in net investment gains (losses) primarily reflects 2018 losses on the fair value option ( FVO\u201d) Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock ( FVO Brighthouse Common Stock\u201d) and higher gains on sales of fixed maturity securities. An unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) was primarily the result of changes in key equity index levels, partially offset by a decline in interest rates.\nThe following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019:\n_______________\n(1) Excludes Corporate & Other adjusted loss available to common shareholders of $401 million.\n(2) Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2018\n Consolidated Results - Highlights Net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.'s common shareholders up $739 million: \u2022 Favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $742 million ($586 million, net of income tax) \u2022 Unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of $223 million ($176 million, net of income tax) \u2022 Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders up $306 million (1) See - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results\u201d and - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\u201d for reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures. Consolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings Highlights Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders up $306 million: \u2022 The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were benefits from certain tax settlements and higher net investment income due to growth in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher interest credited expense, unfavorable underwriting and the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review. \u2022 Our results for 2019 included the following: \u2022 unfavorable impact from our annual actuarial assumption review of $143 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $17 million, net of income tax, charge due to an increase in our incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) long-term care reserves, reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims \u2022 expenses associated with our previously announced unit cost initiative of $332 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $317 million tax benefit related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform \u2022 a $222 million benefit from the IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC, which was comprised of a $158 million tax benefit and a $64 million interest benefit \u2022 Our results for 2018 included the following: \u2022 a $349 million benefit from the IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC, which was comprised of a $168 million tax benefit and a $181 million interest benefit \u2022 favorable reserve adjustment of $62 million, net of income tax, relating to certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former joint venture in Japan \u2022 a $37 million, net of income tax, favorable net insurance adjustment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business \u2022 expenses associated with our previously announced unit cost initiative of $284 million, net of income tax \u2022 a $63 million, net of income tax, charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims \u2022 a $60 million, net of income tax, increase in litigation reserves \u2022 unfavorable impact from our annual actuarial assumption review of $42 million, net of income tax \nFor a more in-depth discussion of our consolidated results, see - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results,\u201d - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results - Adjusted Earnings\u201d and - Results of Operations - Segment Results and Corporate & Other.\u201d\nConsolidated Company Outlook\nAt the December 2019 Investor Day, we introduced our Next Horizon Strategy which is founded on three pillars: (i) Focus\u201d - generate strong free cash flow by deploying capital and resources to the highest value opportunities, (ii) Simplify\u201d - simplify our business to deliver operational efficiency and an outstanding customer experience, and (iii) Differentiate\u201d - drive competitive advantage through our brand, scale, talent, and innovation. The pillars of our Next Horizon Strategy are the basis of our ability to create and deliver optimal shareholder value.\nWe continue to shift our business mix to protection-oriented and fee-based businesses. As a result, we expect our results to be less sensitive to interest rates. Assuming interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves, as of the year ended December 31, 2019, we expect the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 to be 65% to 75%, assuming a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate between 1.5% and 4.5%. We believe that free cash flow is a key determinant of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases. We have returned approximately $16.0 billion to shareholders from 2016 through 2019 and we expect to generate approximately $20.0 billion in free cash flow over the next five years, while maintaining a $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion buffer of liquid assets at the holding companies.\nDespite the prolonged low interest rate environment, we continue to project adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d) other than foreign currency translation adjustments ( FCTA\u201d), of 12% to 14% over the near-term. This target reflects the completion of restructuring charges related to our unit cost improvement program in 2019 which we project will result in approximately $900 million of pre-tax expense margin expansion in 2020. We expect to maintain this margin by holding to a 12.3% direct expense ratio in 2020, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers, while creating additional capacity to fund over $1.0 billion in incremental technology and innovation investments to accelerate our growth over the next five years.\nWhen making these and other projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. Additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury, SEC or the FASB may require us to revise these projections in future periods.\nOther Key Information\nArgentina Highly Inflationary\nThe inflation levels in Argentina have been elevated for several years. In the first half of 2018, Argentina's reported inflation rates began to increase dramatically and the Argentine central bank significantly increased interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Based on Argentina's reported inflation rates and trends, as of July 1, 2018, we designated Argentina as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. The application of highly inflationary accounting did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIndustry Trends\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition.\u201d\nWe have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. For example, MetLife is the largest provider of benefits to Mexican federal government personnel and public officials, however, the administration of President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico is implementing an austerity plan which, among other measures, has eliminated benefits such as major medical insurance and contributions to additional savings benefit insurance for such individuals. See Business - Regulation - Fiscal Measures\u201d and Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, events following the U.K. referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its withdrawal from the EU have contributed to global market volatility. These factors could contribute to weakening Gross Domestic Product growth, primarily in the U.K. and, to a lesser degree, in continental Europe and beyond. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the negotiations regarding future trade and other arrangements. See - Investments - Current Environment - Selected Country and Sector Investments.\u201d We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the possibility of government shutdowns or a failure to raise the debt ceiling, due to a policy impasse or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and liquidity. See Business - Regulation - Cross-Border Trade\u201d and Business - Regulation - Fiscal Measures.\u201d See also Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition\u201d and Risk Factors - Business Risks - The Global Nature of Our Operations Exposes Us to a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks.\u201d\nCentral banks around the world are using monetary policy to address regional economic conditions. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board which had been tightening monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate and shrinking the balance sheet, now has lowered rates to sustain the economic expansion and has begun to expand its balance sheet once again to reduce liquidity issues in financing markets. The European Central Bank has resumed quantitative easing for as long as necessary and left its deposit interest rate unchanged at its historic low. In Japan, the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are maintaining stimulus measures in order to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. Such measures include the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate. Going forward, Japan's structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan's high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks. Further actions by central banks in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other developed and emerging economies, and may ultimately result in market volatility. We cannot predict with certainty the effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio or derivatives. See - Investments - Current Environment.\u201d\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Sustained periods of low U.S. interest rates, may cause us to:\n \u2022 Reduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets ( gross margin\u201d); \n \u2022 Reinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio; \n \u2022 Increase our reserves or trigger loss recognition events related to policy liabilities, accelerate amortization of DAC and VOBA, and potentially impair intangible assets; \n \u2022 Reduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values; \n \u2022 Change our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and \n \u2022 Experience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.

In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management ( ALM\u201d) strategies, including the use of derivatives, and may take management actions such as:\n \u2022 Lowering interest crediting rates or adjusting the dividend scale on products; \n \u2022 Limiting or closing certain products to new sales to manage exposures; and \n \u2022 Shifting sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products.  Our ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive mitigation strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help mitigate unfavorable impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we expect adjusted earnings will continue to increase over the near term despite the sustained low U.S. interest rate environment.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Difficult Economic Conditions May Harm Our Businesses, Results of Operations or Financial Condition - Interest Rate Risk;\u201d Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Policyholder Liabilities;\u201d and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures.\u201d\nLow Interest Rate Scenario\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to lower U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of a hypothetical low interest rate environment (the Low Interest Rate Scenario\u201d) relative to the economic assumptions used for our insurance contracts (the Base Scenario\u201d) through 2022.\nThe Low Interest Rate Scenario assumes an immediate decline of U.S. interest rates for all maturities to 1.00% on January 1, 2020 and subsequent 10 basis point increases for maturities one year and longer on January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2022, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Low Interest Rate Scenario and Base Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant short-term and long-term interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\n\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses) and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives through 2022. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. For purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded all VA program derivatives. For information regarding our VA and non-VA program derivatives, see - Results of Operations - Consolidated Results.\u201d\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings through 2022. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income.\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses) and the adjusted earnings for certain segments, as well as Corporate & Other for the dates indicated:\n\nSegments and Corporate & Other\nThe primary drivers of the Low Interest Rate Scenario impacting our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, are summarized below. Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nFor additional information regarding account values subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d), and the yield on invested assets, see - Investments;\u201d - Policyholder Liabilities - Policyholder Account Balances;\u201d and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nU.S.\nGroup Benefits\nOur group life insurance products are primarily renewable term policies. This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Less than half of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates. Additionally, we experience gross margin compression from our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate risk for both products.\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions.\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nThis business contains both short and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nA significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. The Low Interest Rate Scenario does not assume any additional ALM actions we may take in our capital markets business.\nOur long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nProperty & Casualty\nOur products primarily consist of six-month and annual term renewable policies and do not have policyholder benefits linked to interest rates. This provides significant re-pricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nAsia\nOur Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, we have excluded businesses outside of Japan given their insignificant U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nMetLife Holdings\nOur interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since most of our traditional life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. Although we are able mitigate gross margin compression by lowering interest crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies, these actions may be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees.\nOur annuity products experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these contracts are at their minimum crediting rate, and, therefore we use interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate gross margin compression.\nOur long-term care business experiences gross margin compression as we cannot reduce interest crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximately 7% of our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2022.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements, and our outstanding debt and preferred securities. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets is partially offset by the positive impact of lower interest expense on collateral financing and variable rate debt.\nFor purposes of the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the preferred stock dividend impact is excluded and the impact on pension and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate & Other and not allocated across segments. Under the Low Interest Rate Scenario, the pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase, however, the impact is offset by corresponding returns on the fixed income plan assets resulting in lower expenses.\nCompetitive Pressures\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See Business - Competition.\u201d Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Several of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the capability to engage with the new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets and its impact on the capital position of many competitors will continue to strain the competitive environment. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See Business - Regulation.\u201d We believe that the aforementioned factors have highlighted financial strength, technology efficiency, and organizational agility as the most significant differentiators and, as a result, we believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment.\nRegulatory Developments\nIn the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. See Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\u201d Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products and, in some states, instituted a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions. See Business - Regulation,\u201d Risk Factors - Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks - Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases, and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,\u201d Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Our Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Laws, Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and - Liquidity and Capital Resources - The Company - Capital - Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.\u201d\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\n\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See - Investment Impairments.\u201d Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 6.75%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer
