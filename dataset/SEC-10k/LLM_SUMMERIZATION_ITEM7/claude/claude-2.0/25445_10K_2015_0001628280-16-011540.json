Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products. Our business consists of four segments: Fluid Handling, Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Aerospace & Electronics and Engineered Materials. Our primary markets are chemical, power, oil & gas, aerospace & defense, along with a wide range of general industrial and consumer related end markets.\nOur strategy is to grow earnings and cash flow by focusing on manufacture of highly engineered industrial products for specific markets where our scale is a relative advantage, and where we can compete based on our proprietary and differentiated technology, our deep vertical expertise, and our responsiveness to unique and diverse customer needs. We continuously evaluate our portfolio, pursue acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and that are accretive to our growth profile, selectively divest businesses where appropriate, and pursue internal mergers to improve efficiency. We strive to foster a performance-based culture focused on productivity and continuous improvement, to attract and retain a committed management team whose interests are directly aligned with those of our shareholders, and to maintain a focused, efficient corporate structure.\nResults of Operations - For the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td>

Comparability of Reported Results\nThe comparability of our operating results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is affected by the following significant items:\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nDuring 2015, we recorded pre-tax integration costs of $7.2 million. During 2014, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax integration costs of $9.8 million and 2) pre-tax acquisition related inventory and backlog amortization of $4.8 million. During 2013, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax transaction costs of $22.8 million, 2) pre-tax inventory step-up and backlog amortization of $4.7 million, and 3) withholding taxes of $2.9 million related to cash marshaling activities supporting payment for the acquisition.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nIn 2015, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $11 million, substantially all of which was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments. In 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $33.0 million, of which $22.7 million was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments and $10.3 million was related to the acquisition of MEI.\nDivestiture of Crane Water\nIn 2014, we sold Crane Water which was formerly part of our Fluid Handling segment for $2.1 million. The business had sales of approximately $5 million in 2014 and $15 million in 2013.\nLawsuit Settlement\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax lawsuit settlement of $6.5 million related to the Roseland Site. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Roseland Site.\nEnvironmental Charge\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $49 million to extend accrued costs to 2022 at the Goodyear Site and a $6.8 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with the Roseland Site which are expected to be completed by 2017. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Goodyear Site and Roseland Site.\nDivestiture of a Product Line\nIn 2013, as part of the execution of regulatory remedies associated with the MEI acquisition, we sold a product line, which was formerly part of our Payment & Merchandising Technologies segment, to Suzo-Happ Group for $6.8 million. Sales of this product line were $15.1 million in 2013.\n2015 compared with 2014\nSales decreased by $185 million, or 6%, to $2,741 million in 2015. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 41% of total net sales, respectively. The year-over-year change in sales included:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline in core sales of $35 million, or 1%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable foreign currency translation of $134 million, or 5%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water and the completion of a previously disclosed transition services agreement of $15 million, or 0.5%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating profit increased by $57 million, or 18%, to $373 million in 2015. The increase in operating profit reflected the absence of environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Electronics segments, partially offset by lower operating profit in our Fluid Handling segment.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2014 compared with 2013\nSales increased $330 million, or 13%, to $2.925 billion in 2014. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 41% of total net sales.

The comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $230.0 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of $70.1 million and unamortized losses on pension plans of $8.4 million. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $56.9 million. The comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of unamortized losses on pension plans of $136.5 million and the unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of $114.0 million, substantially offset by net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $193.6 million. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014.

See Application of Critical Accounting Policies included later in this Item 7 for additional information about our provision for income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2015 compared with 2014\nOur effective tax rate was higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily because we earned a higher amount of income in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, partially offset by a higher U.S. federal tax benefit from domestic manufacturing activities.\n2014 compared with 2013\nOur effective tax rate was lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily because our 2013 effective tax rate included the unfavorable effects of non-deductible transaction costs and withholding taxes related to the MEI acquisition. However, this was partially offset by less benefit from the U.S. federal research credit in 2014. While our 2014 effective tax rate includes one year's worth of benefit for the credit because it was extended during 2014 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2014, our 2013 effective tax rate included two years' worth of credit because it was extended during 2013 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2012.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to shareholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic and by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares.\nOur current cash balance of $364 million, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and the $451 million available under our Commercial Paper (\"CP\") Program and revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements, as well as to fund payments associated with our asbestos and environmental liabilities, restructuring and acquisition integration activities and expected pension contributions. In addition, we believe our credit ratings afford us adequate access to public and private markets for debt. We have borrowings totaling $49.0 million outstanding under our CP Program as of December 31, 2015. There are no other significant debt maturities coming due until 2018.\nWe have an estimated liability of $546 million for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through 2021, and while it is probable that this amount will change and we may incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after 2021, which additional liabilities may be material, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time. Similarly, we have an estimated liability of $64 million related to environmental remediation costs projected through 2022 related to our Goodyear Site.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $358 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. Our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from our non-U.S. operations to fund our U.S. operations. In the event we were to repatriate the cash balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. and non-U.S. taxes in connection with such repatriation.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, a key source of our liquidity, was $229.3 million in 2015, compared to $264.0 million in 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from higher working capital requirements and higher environmental payments, partially offset by lower defined benefit plan and postretirement contributions and lower net asbestos-related payments. Net asbestos-related payments in 2015 and 2014 were $49.9 million and $61.3 million, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs, net of related insurance recoveries, of approximately $50 million, environmental payments of approximately $12 million and contributions to our defined benefit plans of approximately $8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash provided by divestitures of businesses or assets and cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities was $35.2 million in 2015, compared to $25.8 million in 2014. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the absence of proceeds from a 2014 purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition of MEI and the divestiture of a small business, coupled with lower proceeds from the disposition of capital assets. These were partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information systems. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $50 million in 2016, reflecting anticipated increases in capital assets required to support product development initiatives, primarily in our Aerospace & Electronics segment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, repayments of indebtedness, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was $143.8 million in 2015, compared to $133.0 million in 2014. The higher levels of cash used for financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of outstanding indebtedness, partially offset by less cash used for open market share repurchases (we repurchased 398,095 shares of our common stock at a cost of $25 million in 2015 and 812,793 shares of our common stock at a cost of $50 million in 2014).\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancing Arrangements\nTotal debt was $799 million and $850 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$250 million of 2.75% notes due 2018;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$300 million of 4.45% notes due 2023;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$199 million of 6.55% notes due 2036;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$49 million of borrowing outstanding under our commercial paper program; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1 million of other debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2.75% notes due 2018 - In December 2013, the Company issued five year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2018 and bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 2.92%.\n4.45% notes due 2023 - In December 2013, the Company issued 10 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2023 and bear interest at 4.45% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 4.56%.\n6.55% notes due 2036 - In November 2006, the Company issued 30 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Company that mature on November 15, 2036 and bear interest at 6.55% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization; these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 6.67%.\nCommercial paper program - On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (the CP Program\u201d) pursuant to which it may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes\u201d) pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $500 million. The Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issue. The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, Notes with a principal amount of $49.0 million were outstanding. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes were used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nOther financing arrangements\nOn May 27, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment (\"Amendment No. 2\") to the Company's five-year, $500 million Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 2, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to May 27, 2020 and (ii) amends the facility fee and applicable margins on the revolving loans made pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Following the effectiveness of Amendment No. 2, at the Company's current credit rating, the facility fee is reduced by 5 basis points to 0.15% while the applicable margin on revolving loans is increased by 5 basis points to 0.10% for base rate loans and 1.10% for LIBOR loans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn May 2012, the Company entered into a five year, $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, and increased to $500 million, the facility\u201d), which is due to expire in May 2017. The facility allows the Company to borrow, repay, or to the extent permitted by the agreement, prepay and re-borrow funds at any time prior to the stated maturity date, and the loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions. Interest is based on, at our option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company's credit rating (LIBOR plus 105 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of LIBOR plus 147.5 basis points), or (2) the greatest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a spread dependent on the Company's credit rating (5 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of 47.5 basis points). At December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including the absence of a material adverse effect and limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements. The facility also provides for customary events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation or warranty made by us is false in any material respect, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, certain ERISA events, material judgments and a change in control of the Company. The facility contains a leverage ratio covenant requiring a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of less than or equal to 65%. At December 31, 2015, our ratio was 41%, as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>749.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>1,139.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,938.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness to capitalization\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll outstanding senior, unsecured notes were issued under an indenture dated as of April 1, 1991. The indenture contains certain limitations on liens and sale and lease-back transactions.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had open standby letters of credit of $23 million issued pursuant to a $125 million uncommitted Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement, and certain other credit lines.\nCredit Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2015, our senior unsecured debt was rated BBB by Standard & Poor's with a Stable outlook and Baa2 with a Stable outlook by Moody's Investors Service. We believe that these ratings afford us adequate access to the public and private markets for debt.\nContractual Obligations\nUnder various agreements, we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under our long-term debt agreements and rent payments required under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>484.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on Consolidated Balance Sheets (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,811.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,021.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Excludes original issue discount.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Pension benefits are funded by the respective pension trusts.

We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include the presentation of net debt, provide useful information about our ability to satisfy our debt obligation with currently available funds.

Demand in these industries is affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors.\nWe remain generally cautious about global economic conditions and the demand for our products, particularly in our Fluid Handling segment. For 2016, we expect a total year-over-year sales decline of approximately 2% driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, with core sales approximately flat compared to 2015.\nConsistent with our focus on productivity, we undertook certain repositioning actions in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments in 2014 and 2015. The costs associated with these repositioning actions were $11.6 million in 2015 and $22.7 million in 2014. Savings associated with these repositioning actions were $14 million in 2015, and we expect incremental savings of $18 million in 2016.\nIn connection with the acquisition of MEI, we recorded $6.6 million in 2015 and $20.1 million of integration and restructuring costs in 2014. We realized approximately $10 million of acquisition-related synergies in 2014, $14 million in 2015, and we expect an incremental $9 million of synergies in 2016.\nFluid Handling\nIn 2016, we expect Fluid Handling sales to decline in the high single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a mid single-digit core sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nWe expect Process Valves and Related Products sales to decline in the low double-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a low double-digit sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Core sales are expected to decline because of slow economic growth and continued weakness in oil prices, which contribute to lower levels of customer capital spending and project delays across the power, oil & gas, chemical, and general industrial end markets.\nWe expect Commercial Valves sales to decline in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a slight improvement in core sales. Core sales are expected to improve slightly, driven by market share gains, largely offset by soft market conditions in the United Kingdom, Middle East, and Canadian non-residential construction markets.\nOur Other Products sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to 2015 given the relative stability of the U.S. municipal market.\nFor the segment, we expect a modest decline in operating profit compared to 2015, as the negative impact from lower core sales and unfavorable foreign currency will be partially offset by productivity initiatives, repositioning benefits, and lower repositioning costs.\nPayment & Merchandising Technologies\nWe expect Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales to increase in the low single-digit range compared to 2015, with a mid single-digit improvement in core sales partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. We expect core sales to improve across both CPI and Merchandising Systems. At CPI, we expect core sales improvement to be driven by several vertical end markets including transportation, vending, and financial services. At Merchandising Systems, we expect an improvement in core sales driven primarily by better demand from large bottler customers. We expect the segment's operating profit to increase compared to 2015 driven by the higher sales, integration synergies, and lower integration costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.\nAerospace & Electronics\nWe expect Aerospace & Electronics core sales to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015. For 2016, we expect that commercial market conditions will remain generally positive. We expect commercial aftermarket sales to decline in the low single digit range primarily because of lower retrofit program sales. Although we expect defense markets to remain relatively flat, we expect our military sales to increase substantially as a result of a large contract for our microwave products, along with higher sales for a major military aerospace program. We expect segment operating profit in 2016 to improve slightly compared to 2015 driven by higher sales and repositioning benefits, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher engineering spending.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEngineered Materials\nIn 2016, we expect the Engineered Materials segment sales will be approximately flat compared to the prior year. We expect modest growth in sales to the RV and building products markets, offset by a decline in sales to the transportation market. Segment operating profit is expected to decline modestly, primarily from a contraction in the spread between raw material costs and pricing.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. The accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and, therefore, are critical to understanding our results of operations. We have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition. Sales revenue is recorded when title (risk of loss) passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue on long-term, fixed-price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all current industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral of the effective date; the new standard is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption of the new revenue standard is permitted, however, entities reporting under U.S. GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date, December 15, 2016. The new standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.\nInventories. Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $48.4 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year(s) in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.\nBased on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization, we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that, in our judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The evidence we consider in reaching such conclusions includes, but is not limited to, (1) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, (3) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law, (4) cumulative losses in recent years, (5) a history of tax losses or credit carryforwards expiring unused, (6) a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief it limits realization of tax benefits, and (7) a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the carryforward and support showing that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nposition that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn determining whether the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested overseas, we consider the following:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our history of utilizing non-U.S. cash to acquire non-U.S. businesses,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our current and future needs for cash outside the U.S. (e.g., to fund capital expenditures, business operations, potential acquisitions, etc.),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to satisfy U.S.-based cash needs (e.g., domestic pension contributions, interest payment on external debt, dividends to shareholders, etc.) with cash generated by our U.S. businesses, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The effect U.S. tax reform proposals calling for reduced corporate income tax rates and/or repatriation\u201d tax holidays would have on the amount of the tax liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.168 billion of goodwill. Our business acquisitions typically result in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets. We follow the provisions under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d) as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These provisions require that we, on at least an annual basis, evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status. A reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment (a component\u201d), in which case the component would be the reporting unit. At December 31, 2015, we had seven reporting units.\nWhen performing our annual impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value. Goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which, as of our most recent annual impairment assessment, ranged between 10.0% and 12.5% (a weighted average of 10.8%), reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested. This methodology for valuing our reporting units (commonly referred to as the Income Method) has not changed since the prior year. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. In addition to the foregoing, for each reporting unit, market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical, reasonably possible 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The results of this hypothetical 10% decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units. No impairment charges have been required during 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $317 million of net intangible assets, of which $27 million were intangibles with indefinite useful lives, consisting of trade names. We amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible exceeds the fair value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows.\nIn addition to annual testing for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we review all of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nlimited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group, or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the long-lived asset (or asset group), as well as specific asset appraisal in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long-lived assets or asset groups and include consideration of estimated future revenues, gross profit margins, operating profit margins and capital expenditures which are based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a charge would be taken against net earnings based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Judgments that we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Such judgments are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. Historical results to date have generally approximated expected cash flows for the identifiable cash flow generating level. We believe that there have been no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets below their carrying value.\nContingencies. The categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability, the amount of our liability accruals, and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies. Please refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nAsbestos Liability and Related Insurance Coverage and Receivable. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos liability of $546 million for pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through December 31, 2021. Estimation of our exposure for asbestos-related claims is subject to significant uncertainties, as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing, severity and quantity of claims and the manner of their resolution. We have retained the firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. ( HR&A\u201d), a nationally recognized expert in the field, to assist management in estimating our asbestos liability in the tort system. HR&A reviews information provided by us concerning claims filed, settled and dismissed, amounts paid in settlements and relevant claim information such as the nature of the asbestos-related disease asserted by the claimant, the jurisdiction where filed and the time lag from filing to disposition of the claim. The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on our experience during a base reference period of eleven quarterly periods (consisting of the two full preceding calendar years and three additional quarterly periods to the estimate date) for claims filed, settled and dismissed. Our experience is then compared to estimates of the number of individuals likely to develop asbestos-related diseases determined based on widely used previously conducted epidemiological studies augmented with current data inputs. Using that information, HR&A estimates the number of future claims that would be filed against us through our forecast period and estimates the aggregate settlement or indemnity costs that would be incurred to resolve both pending and future claims based upon the average settlement costs by disease during the reference period. Our liability estimate is augmented for the estimated cost of defending asbestos claims in the tort system. The most significant factors affecting the liability estimate are (1) the number of new mesothelioma claims filed against us, (2) the average settlement costs for mesothelioma claims, (3) the percentage of mesothelioma claims dismissed against us and (4) the aggregate defense costs incurred by us. These factors are interdependent, and no one factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Management believes that the level of uncertainty regarding the various factors used in estimating future asbestos costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the indicated estimate. In addition to claim experience, we consider additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of the aging of pending claims, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, and their respective effects on expected future settlement values. Based on this evaluation, we determined that no change in the estimate was warranted for the period ended December 31, 2015. Nevertheless, if certain factors show a pattern of sustained increase or decrease, the liability could change materially; however, all the assumptions used in estimating the asbestos liability are interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Because of the uncertainty with regard to and the interdependency of such factors used in the calculation of our asbestos liability, and since no one factor predominates, we believe that a range of potential liability estimates beyond the indicated forecast period cannot be reasonably estimated.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn conjunction with developing the aggregate liability estimate referenced above, we also developed an estimate of probable insurance recoveries for our asbestos liabilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos receivable of $129 million. In developing this estimate, we considered our coverage-in-place and other settlement agreements, as well as a number of additional factors. These additional factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method by which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies, how settlement and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships.\nEnvironmental. For environmental matters, we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated. Generally, third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs. The environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2015 is substantially all for the Goodyear Site. Estimates of the Company's environmental liabilities at the Goodyear Site are based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology available for remediation, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These estimates consider the Company's prior experience in the Goodyear Site investigation and remediation, as well as available data from, and in consultation with, the Company's environmental specialists. Estimates at the Goodyear Site are subject to significant uncertainties caused primarily by the dynamic nature of the Goodyear Site conditions, the range of remediation alternatives available, together with the corresponding estimates of cleanup methodology and costs, as well as ongoing, required regulatory approvals, primarily from the EPA. During the third quarter of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision amendment requiring, among other things, additional source area remediation resulting in the Company recording a charge of $49.0 million, extending the accrued costs through 2022. As of December 31, 2015, the total estimated gross liability for the Goodyear Site was $64 million.\nOn July 31, 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. Government reimburses us for 21% of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the Goodyear Site.\nPension Plans. In the United States, we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately 19% of all U.S. employees. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis, except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service. This plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary. Contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date. A number of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately 11% of all non-U.S. employees. The benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation. These plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service.\nThe expected return on plan assets component of Net Periodic Benefit Cost is determined by applying the assumed expected return on plan assets to the fair value of plan assets. For one of the U.K. pension plans, a market-related value of assets is used in lieu of the fair value of plan assets for this purpose. The net actuarial loss (gain) is amortized to the extent that it exceeds 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. The amortization period is the average life expectancy of plan participants for most plans. The amortization period for plans with a significant number of active participants accruing benefits is the average future working lifetime of plan participants. The prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the average future working lifetime of plan participants whose prior service benefits were changed.\nThe net periodic pension (benefit) cost was $(11) million, $(12) million and $5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic pension benefit was $1 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. The reasons for the difference between the net periodic pension benefit gain of $12 million in 2014, and the $5 million loss in 2013, included the return on plan assets in 2013 being $56 million higher than expected ($13 million reduction in net periodic benefit cost), as well as closure of certain defined benefit plans in our U.K. operations recognized at the end of 2013 ($5 million reduction in net periodic benefit costs). In the United States, the increase in discount rate from 4.20% to 4.90% also contributed to the gain of $12 million. Employer cash contributions were $17 million, $24 million and $15 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. We expect, based on current actuarial calculations, to contribute cash of approximately $8 million to our pension plans in 2016. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets.\nFor the pension plan, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would have increased U.S. 2015 pension expense by $1.0 million for U.S. pension plans and $1.1 million for non-U.S. pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost by 0.25 percentage points would have increased 2015 pension expense by $0.2 million for U.S. pension plans and $0.9 million for non-U.S. pension plans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries, utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns.

Comparability of Reported Results\nThe comparability of our operating results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is affected by the following significant items:\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nDuring 2015, we recorded pre-tax integration costs of $7.2 million. During 2014, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax integration costs of $9.8 million and 2) pre-tax acquisition related inventory and backlog amortization of $4.8 million. During 2013, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax transaction costs of $22.8 million, 2) pre-tax inventory step-up and backlog amortization of $4.7 million, and 3) withholding taxes of $2.9 million related to cash marshaling activities supporting payment for the acquisition.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nIn 2015, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $11 million, substantially all of which was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments. In 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $33.0 million, of which $22.7 million was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments and $10.3 million was related to the acquisition of MEI.\nDivestiture of Crane Water\nIn 2014, we sold Crane Water which was formerly part of our Fluid Handling segment for $2.1 million. The business had sales of approximately $5 million in 2014 and $15 million in 2013.\nLawsuit Settlement\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax lawsuit settlement of $6.5 million related to the Roseland Site. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Roseland Site.\nEnvironmental Charge\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $49 million to extend accrued costs to 2022 at the Goodyear Site and a $6.8 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with the Roseland Site which are expected to be completed by 2017. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Goodyear Site and Roseland Site.\nDivestiture of a Product Line\nIn 2013, as part of the execution of regulatory remedies associated with the MEI acquisition, we sold a product line, which was formerly part of our Payment & Merchandising Technologies segment, to Suzo-Happ Group for $6.8 million. Sales of this product line were $15.1 million in 2013.\n2015 compared with 2014\nSales decreased by $185 million, or 6%, to $2,741 million in 2015. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 41% of total net sales, respectively. The year-over-year change in sales included:\n \u2022 a decline in core sales of $35 million, or 1%; \n \u2022 unfavorable foreign currency translation of $134 million, or 5%; \n \u2022 the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water and the completion of a previously disclosed transition services agreement of $15 million, or 0.5%.  Operating profit increased by $57 million, or 18%, to $373 million in 2015. The increase in operating profit reflected the absence of environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Electronics segments, partially offset by lower operating profit in our Fluid Handling segment.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2014 compared with 2013\nSales increased $330 million, or 13%, to $2.925 billion in 2014. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 41% of total net sales. The year-over-year change in sales included:\n \u2022 an increase in core sales of $9 million, or 0.3%; \n \u2022 unfavorable foreign exchange of $11 million, or 0.4%; \n \u2022 an increase in revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, of $332 million, or 13%.  Operating profit decreased $32 million, or 9%, to $316 million in 2014. The decrease in operating profit was driven by environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with lower operating profit in our Aerospace & Electronics and Fluid Handling segments, partially offset by higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies and Engineered Materials segments.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before allocation to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency translation adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit obligation, net of tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(136.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other comprehensive (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(250.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comprehensive income before allocation to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Noncontrolling interests in comprehensive income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared with 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $151.5 million. The comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $230.0 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of $70.1 million and unamortized losses on pension plans of $8.4 million. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $56.9 million. The comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of unamortized losses on pension plans of $136.5 million and the unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of $114.0 million, substantially offset by net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $193.6 million. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014.

Fluid Handling operating profit decreased by $56 million, or 31%, to $125 million in 2015. The decrease was driven by a $40 million impact from the lower sales, unfavorable product mix, price and to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and related charges.\n2014 compared with 2013\nFluid Handling sales decreased by $25 million, or 2% to $1,264 million, driven by a core sales decline of $10 million, or 0.8%, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, or 0.5%, and the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water of $8 million, or 0.6%.\n \u2022 Sales of Process Valves and Related Products decreased by $16 million, or 2%, to $805 million in 2014, including a core sales decline of $14 million, or 2%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $2 million, or 0.2%. The decrease in core sales reflected lower sales in chemical and oil and gas end markets, partially offset by higher sales in the general industrial end market. The lower sales in chemical and oil & gas end markets were primarily driven by project delays and lower investments in chemical and refining applications for our severe service valves. \n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $3 million, or 1%, to $362 million in 2014, including unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, or 1%, as the Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a core sales increase of $2 million, or 0.4%. The increase in core sales was primarily driven higher sales to the commercial building construction end market in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 Sales of Other Products decreased by $6 million, or 6%, in 2014 to $96 million, primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water.

Aerospace & Electronics operating profit decreased by $22 million, or 14%, to $138 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in engineering and new product development spending supporting new program wins and higher costs associated with new product launches in our cabin business, restructuring and related charges of $8 million and an unfavorable product mix driven by stronger demand in early commercial programs which tend to carry lower margins, partially offset by productivity gains.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nENGINEERED MATERIALS\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales by product line:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRP- Recreational Vehicles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRP- Building Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FRP- Transportation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared with 2014\nEngineered Materials sales increased by $2 million, or 1%, to $255 million in 2015.\n \u2022 Sales of Fiberglass-reinforced plastic panels (\"FRP\") to recreational vehicle (\"RV\") manufacturers increased slightly, resulting from higher sales of our RV-related applications as RV OEM build rates remained strong throughout 2015, primarily reflecting low fuel prices and continued low interest rates. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to building products customers increased $1 million, or 2%, to $83 million in 2015, reflecting a modest recovery in commercial construction end markets in the United States.  Engineered Materials operating profit increased by $12 million, or 32%, to $48 million in 2015, reflecting lower raw material costs, primarily resin, and strong productivity gains.\n2014 compared with 2013\nEngineered Materials sales increased by $21 million, or 9%, to $253 million in 2014.\n \u2022 Sales of FRP to RV manufacturers increased by $20 million, or 18%, to $134 million in 2014, reflecting higher demand for our RV-related applications as RV OEM build rates remained strong, with both dealer and retail demand continuing through 2014. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to building products customers decreased $2 million, or 3%, to $82 million in 2014, reflecting a slow recovery in commercial construction end markets in the United States. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to transportation-related customers increased by $3 million, or 10%, to $38 million in 2014, reflecting higher sales in Latin America, timing of a large fleet build with one customer in North America and higher sales of aerodynamic side skirts for trailers.  Engineered Materials operating profit increased by $2 million, or 7%, to $37 million, in 2014, reflecting a $6 million impact from the higher sales and strong productivity gains, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and higher raw material costs, primarily resin and substrates.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense - Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared with 2014\nTotal Corporate decreased by $62 million, or 56%, to $48 million in 2015, primarily due to the absence a $49 million charge related to an increase in the Company's liability at its Goodyear Site, a $6.8 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with our Roseland Site and a $6.5 million charge related to a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013\nTotal Corporate increased by $33 million, or 45%, to $109 million in 2014, primarily due to the aforementioned $49 million charge related to our Goodyear Site, a $6.8 million charge related to our Roseland Site and a $6.5 million charge related to a lawsuit settlement.

See Application of Critical Accounting Policies included later in this Item 7 for additional information about our provision for income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2015 compared with 2014\nOur effective tax rate was higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily because we earned a higher amount of income in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, partially offset by a higher U.S. federal tax benefit from domestic manufacturing activities.\n2014 compared with 2013\nOur effective tax rate was lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily because our 2013 effective tax rate included the unfavorable effects of non-deductible transaction costs and withholding taxes related to the MEI acquisition. However, this was partially offset by less benefit from the U.S. federal research credit in 2014. While our 2014 effective tax rate includes one year's worth of benefit for the credit because it was extended during 2014 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2014, our 2013 effective tax rate included two years' worth of credit because it was extended during 2013 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2012.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to shareholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic and by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares.\nOur current cash balance of $364 million, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and the $451 million available under our Commercial Paper (\"CP\") Program and revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements, as well as to fund payments associated with our asbestos and environmental liabilities, restructuring and acquisition integration activities and expected pension contributions. In addition, we believe our credit ratings afford us adequate access to public and private markets for debt. We have borrowings totaling $49.0 million outstanding under our CP Program as of December 31, 2015. There are no other significant debt maturities coming due until 2018.\nWe have an estimated liability of $546 million for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through 2021, and while it is probable that this amount will change and we may incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after 2021, which additional liabilities may be material, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time. Similarly, we have an estimated liability of $64 million related to environmental remediation costs projected through 2022 related to our Goodyear Site.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $358 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. Our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from our non-U.S. operations to fund our U.S. operations. In the event we were to repatriate the cash balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. and non-U.S. taxes in connection with such repatriation.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, a key source of our liquidity, was $229.3 million in 2015, compared to $264.0 million in 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from higher working capital requirements and higher environmental payments, partially offset by lower defined benefit plan and postretirement contributions and lower net asbestos-related payments. Net asbestos-related payments in 2015 and 2014 were $49.9 million and $61.3 million, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs, net of related insurance recoveries, of approximately $50 million, environmental payments of approximately $12 million and contributions to our defined benefit plans of approximately $8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash provided by divestitures of businesses or assets and cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities was $35.2 million in 2015, compared to $25.8 million in 2014. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the absence of proceeds from a 2014 purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition of MEI and the divestiture of a small business, coupled with lower proceeds from the disposition of capital assets. These were partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information systems. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $50 million in 2016, reflecting anticipated increases in capital assets required to support product development initiatives, primarily in our Aerospace & Electronics segment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, repayments of indebtedness, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was $143.8 million in 2015, compared to $133.0 million in 2014. The higher levels of cash used for financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of outstanding indebtedness, partially offset by less cash used for open market share repurchases (we repurchased 398,095 shares of our common stock at a cost of $25 million in 2015 and 812,793 shares of our common stock at a cost of $50 million in 2014).\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancing Arrangements\nTotal debt was $799 million and $850 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\n \u2022 $250 million of 2.75% notes due 2018; \n \u2022 $300 million of 4.45% notes due 2023; \n \u2022 $199 million of 6.55% notes due 2036; \n \u2022 $49 million of borrowing outstanding under our commercial paper program; and \n \u2022 $1 million of other debt.  2.75% notes due 2018 - In December 2013, the Company issued five year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2018 and bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 2.92%.\n4.45% notes due 2023 - In December 2013, the Company issued 10 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2023 and bear interest at 4.45% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 4.56%.\n6.55% notes due 2036 - In November 2006, the Company issued 30 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Company that mature on November 15, 2036 and bear interest at 6.55% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization; these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 6.67%.\nCommercial paper program - On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (the CP Program\u201d) pursuant to which it may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes\u201d) pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $500 million. The Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issue. The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, Notes with a principal amount of $49.0 million were outstanding. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes were used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nOther financing arrangements\nOn May 27, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment (\"Amendment No. 2\") to the Company's five-year, $500 million Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 2, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to May 27, 2020 and (ii) amends the facility fee and applicable margins on the revolving loans made pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Following the effectiveness of Amendment No. 2, at the Company's current credit rating, the facility fee is reduced by 5 basis points to 0.15% while the applicable margin on revolving loans is increased by 5 basis points to 0.10% for base rate loans and 1.10% for LIBOR loans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn May 2012, the Company entered into a five year, $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, and increased to $500 million, the facility\u201d), which is due to expire in May 2017. The facility allows the Company to borrow, repay, or to the extent permitted by the agreement, prepay and re-borrow funds at any time prior to the stated maturity date, and the loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions. Interest is based on, at our option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company's credit rating (LIBOR plus 105 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of LIBOR plus 147.5 basis points), or (2) the greatest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a spread dependent on the Company's credit rating (5 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of 47.5 basis points). At December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including the absence of a material adverse effect and limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements. The facility also provides for customary events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation or warranty made by us is false in any material respect, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, certain ERISA events, material judgments and a change in control of the Company. The facility contains a leverage ratio covenant requiring a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of less than or equal to 65%. At December 31, 2015, our ratio was 41%, as follows:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions) December 31,\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>749.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>1,139.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,938.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total indebtedness to capitalization\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll outstanding senior, unsecured notes were issued under an indenture dated as of April 1, 1991. The indenture contains certain limitations on liens and sale and lease-back transactions.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had open standby letters of credit of $23 million issued pursuant to a $125 million uncommitted Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement, and certain other credit lines.\nCredit Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2015, our senior unsecured debt was rated BBB by Standard & Poor's with a Stable outlook and Baa2 with a Stable outlook by Moody's Investors Service. We believe that these ratings afford us adequate access to the public and private markets for debt.\nContractual Obligations\nUnder various agreements, we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under our long-term debt agreements and rent payments required under operating lease agreements.

As of December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $358 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include the presentation of net debt, provide useful information about our ability to satisfy our debt obligation with currently available funds. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. \n Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in the context of the definitions of the elements of such measures we provide and in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our reported results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nIn 2015, equity increased $80 million, primarily as a result of net income attributable to common shareholders of $229 million and stock option exercises of $11 million, partially offset by cash dividends of $77 million, changes in currency translation adjustment of $70 million, open-market share repurchases of $25 million and changes in pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit obligations, net of tax, of $8 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements, nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose off-balance sheet financing entities.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOUTLOOK\nOverall\nOur sales depend heavily on industries that are cyclical in nature or are subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable. Demand in these industries is affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors.\nWe remain generally cautious about global economic conditions and the demand for our products, particularly in our Fluid Handling segment. For 2016, we expect a total year-over-year sales decline of approximately 2% driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, with core sales approximately flat compared to 2015.\nConsistent with our focus on productivity, we undertook certain repositioning actions in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments in 2014 and 2015. The costs associated with these repositioning actions were $11.6 million in 2015 and $22.7 million in 2014. Savings associated with these repositioning actions were $14 million in 2015, and we expect incremental savings of $18 million in 2016.\nIn connection with the acquisition of MEI, we recorded $6.6 million in 2015 and $20.1 million of integration and restructuring costs in 2014. We realized approximately $10 million of acquisition-related synergies in 2014, $14 million in 2015, and we expect an incremental $9 million of synergies in 2016.\nFluid Handling\nIn 2016, we expect Fluid Handling sales to decline in the high single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a mid single-digit core sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nWe expect Process Valves and Related Products sales to decline in the low double-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a low double-digit sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Core sales are expected to decline because of slow economic growth and continued weakness in oil prices, which contribute to lower levels of customer capital spending and project delays across the power, oil & gas, chemical, and general industrial end markets.\nWe expect Commercial Valves sales to decline in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a slight improvement in core sales. Core sales are expected to improve slightly, driven by market share gains, largely offset by soft market conditions in the United Kingdom, Middle East, and Canadian non-residential construction markets.\nOur Other Products sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to 2015 given the relative stability of the U.S. municipal market.\nFor the segment, we expect a modest decline in operating profit compared to 2015, as the negative impact from lower core sales and unfavorable foreign currency will be partially offset by productivity initiatives, repositioning benefits, and lower repositioning costs.\nPayment & Merchandising Technologies\nWe expect Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales to increase in the low single-digit range compared to 2015, with a mid single-digit improvement in core sales partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. We expect core sales to improve across both CPI and Merchandising Systems. At CPI, we expect core sales improvement to be driven by several vertical end markets including transportation, vending, and financial services. At Merchandising Systems, we expect an improvement in core sales driven primarily by better demand from large bottler customers. We expect the segment's operating profit to increase compared to 2015 driven by the higher sales, integration synergies, and lower integration costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.\nAerospace & Electronics\nWe expect Aerospace & Electronics core sales to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015. For 2016, we expect that commercial market conditions will remain generally positive. We expect commercial aftermarket sales to decline in the low single digit range primarily because of lower retrofit program sales. Although we expect defense markets to remain relatively flat, we expect our military sales to increase substantially as a result of a large contract for our microwave products, along with higher sales for a major military aerospace program. We expect segment operating profit in 2016 to improve slightly compared to 2015 driven by higher sales and repositioning benefits, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher engineering spending.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEngineered Materials\nIn 2016, we expect the Engineered Materials segment sales will be approximately flat compared to the prior year. We expect modest growth in sales to the RV and building products markets, offset by a decline in sales to the transportation market. Segment operating profit is expected to decline modestly, primarily from a contraction in the spread between raw material costs and pricing.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. The accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and, therefore, are critical to understanding our results of operations. We have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition. Sales revenue is recorded when title (risk of loss) passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue on long-term, fixed-price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all current industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral of the effective date; the new standard is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption of the new revenue standard is permitted, however, entities reporting under U.S. GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date, December 15, 2016. The new standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.\nInventories. Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $48.4 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year(s) in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.\nBased on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization, we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that, in our judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The evidence we consider in reaching such conclusions includes, but is not limited to, (1) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, (3) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law, (4) cumulative losses in recent years, (5) a history of tax losses or credit carryforwards expiring unused, (6) a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief it limits realization of tax benefits, and (7) a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the carryforward and support showing that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nposition that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn determining whether the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested overseas, we consider the following:\n \u2022 Our history of utilizing non-U.S. cash to acquire non-U.S. businesses, \n \u2022 Our current and future needs for cash outside the U.S. (e.g., to fund capital expenditures, business operations, potential acquisitions, etc.), \n \u2022 Our ability to satisfy U.S.-based cash needs (e.g., domestic pension contributions, interest payment on external debt, dividends to shareholders, etc.) with cash generated by our U.S. businesses, and \n \u2022 The effect U.S. tax reform proposals calling for reduced corporate income tax rates and/or repatriation\u201d tax holidays would have on the amount of the tax liability.  Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.168 billion of goodwill. Our business acquisitions typically result in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets. We follow the provisions under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d) as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These provisions require that we, on at least an annual basis, evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status. A reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment (a component\u201d), in which case the component would be the reporting unit. At December 31, 2015, we had seven reporting units.\nWhen performing our annual impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value. Goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which, as of our most recent annual impairment assessment, ranged between 10.0% and 12.5% (a weighted average of 10.8%), reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested. This methodology for valuing our reporting units (commonly referred to as the Income Method) has not changed since the prior year. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. In addition to the foregoing, for each reporting unit, market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical, reasonably possible 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The results of this hypothetical 10% decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units. No impairment charges have been required during 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $317 million of net intangible assets, of which $27 million were intangibles with indefinite useful lives, consisting of trade names. We amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible exceeds the fair value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows.\nIn addition to annual testing for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we review all of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nlimited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group, or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the long-lived asset (or asset group), as well as specific asset appraisal in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long-lived assets or asset groups and include consideration of estimated future revenues, gross profit margins, operating profit margins and capital expenditures which are based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a charge would be taken against net earnings based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Judgments that we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Such judgments are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. Historical results to date have generally approximated expected cash flows for the identifiable cash flow generating level. We believe that there have been no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets below their carrying value.\nContingencies. The categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability, the amount of our liability accruals, and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies. Please refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nAsbestos Liability and Related Insurance Coverage and Receivable. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos liability of $546 million for pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through December 31, 2021. Estimation of our exposure for asbestos-related claims is subject to significant uncertainties, as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing, severity and quantity of claims and the manner of their resolution. We have retained the firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. ( HR&A\u201d), a nationally recognized expert in the field, to assist management in estimating our asbestos liability in the tort system. HR&A reviews information provided by us concerning claims filed, settled and dismissed, amounts paid in settlements and relevant claim information such as the nature of the asbestos-related disease asserted by the claimant, the jurisdiction where filed and the time lag from filing to disposition of the claim. The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on our experience during a base reference period of eleven quarterly periods (consisting of the two full preceding calendar years and three additional quarterly periods to the estimate date) for claims filed, settled and dismissed. Our experience is then compared to estimates of the number of individuals likely to develop asbestos-related diseases determined based on widely used previously conducted epidemiological studies augmented with current data inputs. Using that information, HR&A estimates the number of future claims that would be filed against us through our forecast period and estimates the aggregate settlement or indemnity costs that would be incurred to resolve both pending and future claims based upon the average settlement costs by disease during the reference period. Our liability estimate is augmented for the estimated cost of defending asbestos claims in the tort system. The most significant factors affecting the liability estimate are (1) the number of new mesothelioma claims filed against us, (2) the average settlement costs for mesothelioma claims, (3) the percentage of mesothelioma claims dismissed against us and (4) the aggregate defense costs incurred by us. These factors are interdependent, and no one factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Management believes that the level of uncertainty regarding the various factors used in estimating future asbestos costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the indicated estimate. In addition to claim experience, we consider additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of the aging of pending claims, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, and their respective effects on expected future settlement values. Based on this evaluation, we determined that no change in the estimate was warranted for the period ended December 31, 2015. Nevertheless, if certain factors show a pattern of sustained increase or decrease, the liability could change materially; however, all the assumptions used in estimating the asbestos liability are interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Because of the uncertainty with regard to and the interdependency of such factors used in the calculation of our asbestos liability, and since no one factor predominates, we believe that a range of potential liability estimates beyond the indicated forecast period cannot be reasonably estimated.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn conjunction with developing the aggregate liability estimate referenced above, we also developed an estimate of probable insurance recoveries for our asbestos liabilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos receivable of $129 million. In developing this estimate, we considered our coverage-in-place and other settlement agreements, as well as a number of additional factors. These additional factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method by which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies, how settlement and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships.\nEnvironmental. For environmental matters, we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated. Generally, third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs. The environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2015 is substantially all for the Goodyear Site. Estimates of the Company's environmental liabilities at the Goodyear Site are based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology available for remediation, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These estimates consider the Company's prior experience in the Goodyear Site investigation and remediation, as well as available data from, and in consultation with, the Company's environmental specialists. Estimates at the Goodyear Site are subject to significant uncertainties caused primarily by the dynamic nature of the Goodyear Site conditions, the range of remediation alternatives available, together with the corresponding estimates of cleanup methodology and costs, as well as ongoing, required regulatory approvals, primarily from the EPA. During the third quarter of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision amendment requiring, among other things, additional source area remediation resulting in the Company recording a charge of $49.0 million, extending the accrued costs through 2022. As of December 31, 2015, the total estimated gross liability for the Goodyear Site was $64 million.\nOn July 31, 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. Government reimburses us for 21% of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the Goodyear Site.\nPension Plans. In the United States, we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately 19% of all U.S. employees. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis, except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service. This plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary. Contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date. A number of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately 11% of all non-U.S. employees. The benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation. These plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service.\nThe expected return on plan assets component of Net Periodic Benefit Cost is determined by applying the assumed expected return on plan assets to the fair value of plan assets. For one of the U.K. pension plans, a market-related value of assets is used in lieu of the fair value of plan assets for this purpose. The net actuarial loss (gain) is amortized to the extent that it exceeds 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. The amortization period is the average life expectancy of plan participants for most plans. The amortization period for plans with a significant number of active participants accruing benefits is the average future working lifetime of plan participants. The prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the average future working lifetime of plan participants whose prior service benefits were changed.\nThe net periodic pension (benefit) cost was $(11) million, $(12) million and $5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic pension benefit was $1 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. The reasons for the difference between the net periodic pension benefit gain of $12 million in 2014, and the $5 million loss in 2013, included the return on plan assets in 2013 being $56 million higher than expected ($13 million reduction in net periodic benefit cost), as well as closure of certain defined benefit plans in our U.K. operations recognized at the end of 2013 ($5 million reduction in net periodic benefit costs). In the United States, the increase in discount rate from 4.20% to 4.90% also contributed to the gain of $12 million. Employer cash contributions were $17 million, $24 million and $15 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. We expect, based on current actuarial calculations, to contribute cash of approximately $8 million to our pension plans in 2016. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets.\nFor the pension plan, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would have increased U.S. 2015 pension expense by $1.0 million for U.S. pension plans and $1.1 million for non-U.S. pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost by 0.25 percentage points would have increased 2015 pension expense by $0.2 million for U.S. pension plans and $0.9 million for non-U.S. pension plans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-U.S. Plans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of compensation increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries, utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns.

During 2014, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax integration costs of $9.8 million and 2) pre-tax acquisition related inventory and backlog amortization of $4.8 million. During 2013, we recorded the following costs associated with the acquisition of MEI: 1) pre-tax transaction costs of $22.8 million, 2) pre-tax inventory step-up and backlog amortization of $4.7 million, and 3) withholding taxes of $2.9 million related to cash marshaling activities supporting payment for the acquisition.\nRestructuring and Related Costs\nIn 2015, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $11 million, substantially all of which was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments. In 2014, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $33.0 million, of which $22.7 million was related to the repositioning activities in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments and $10.3 million was related to the acquisition of MEI.\nDivestiture of Crane Water\nIn 2014, we sold Crane Water which was formerly part of our Fluid Handling segment for $2.1 million. The business had sales of approximately $5 million in 2014 and $15 million in 2013.\nLawsuit Settlement\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax lawsuit settlement of $6.5 million related to the Roseland Site. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Roseland Site.\nEnvironmental Charge\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $49 million to extend accrued costs to 2022 at the Goodyear Site and a $6.8 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with the Roseland Site which are expected to be completed by 2017. Please refer to Note 10, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for further discussion of the Goodyear Site and Roseland Site.\nDivestiture of a Product Line\nIn 2013, as part of the execution of regulatory remedies associated with the MEI acquisition, we sold a product line, which was formerly part of our Payment & Merchandising Technologies segment, to Suzo-Happ Group for $6.8 million. Sales of this product line were $15.1 million in 2013.\n2015 compared with 2014\nSales decreased by $185 million, or 6%, to $2,741 million in 2015. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 41% of total net sales, respectively. The year-over-year change in sales included:\n \u2022 a decline in core sales of $35 million, or 1%; \n \u2022 unfavorable foreign currency translation of $134 million, or 5%; \n \u2022 the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water and the completion of a previously disclosed transition services agreement of $15 million, or 0.5%.  Operating profit increased by $57 million, or 18%, to $373 million in 2015. The increase in operating profit reflected the absence of environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies, Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Electronics segments, partially offset by lower operating profit in our Fluid Handling segment.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2014 compared with 2013\nSales increased $330 million, or 13%, to $2.925 billion in 2014. Net sales related to operations outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 41% of total net sales. The year-over-year change in sales included:\n \u2022 an increase in core sales of $9 million, or 0.3%; \n \u2022 unfavorable foreign exchange of $11 million, or 0.4%; \n \u2022 an increase in revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, of $332 million, or 13%.  Operating profit decreased $32 million, or 9%, to $316 million in 2014. The decrease in operating profit was driven by environmental charges and a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014, coupled with lower operating profit in our Aerospace & Electronics and Fluid Handling segments, partially offset by higher operating profit in our Payment & Merchandising Technologies and Engineered Materials segments.\n\n2015 compared with 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $151.5 million. The comprehensive income before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $230.0 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of $70.1 million and unamortized losses on pension plans of $8.4 million. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was $56.9 million. The comprehensive loss before allocations to noncontrolling interests was a result of unamortized losses on pension plans of $136.5 million and the unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of $114.0 million, substantially offset by net income before allocations to noncontrolling interests of $193.6 million. The unamortized losses on pension plans were primarily due to a decrease in assumed discount rates, lower than expected return on pension plan assets, and the adoption of revised actuarial mortality tables in 2014. The unrealized loss on foreign currency translation adjustments of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to U.S. dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFLUID HANDLING\n\n * The restructuring and related charges are included in operating profit and operating margin. \n2015 compared with 2014\nFluid Handling sales decreased by $172 million, or 14%, to $1,091 million, driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $89 million, or 7%, a core sales decline of $78 million, or 6%, and the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water of $5 million, or 0.4%.\n \u2022 Sales of Process Valves and Related Products decreased by $124 million, or 15%, to $681 million in 2015, including a core sales decline of $75 million, or 9%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million, or 6%, as both the British pound and euro weakened against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in core sales reflected lower sales in chemical, oil and gas, power, and general industrial end markets. The lower sales were driven by a significant decline in global oil prices and weaker economic conditions in Europe and Asia. \n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $46 million, or 13%, to $316 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $39 million, or 11%, as the British pound and Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar. Core sales decreased $7 million, or 2%, reflecting lower sales in non-residential construction in the United Kingdom and municipal end markets in continental Europe.  Fluid Handling operating profit decreased by $56 million, or 31%, to $125 million in 2015. The decrease was driven by a $40 million impact from the lower sales, unfavorable product mix, price and to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and related charges.\n2014 compared with 2013\nFluid Handling sales decreased by $25 million, or 2% to $1,264 million, driven by a core sales decline of $10 million, or 0.8%, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, or 0.5%, and the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water of $8 million, or 0.6%.\n \u2022 Sales of Process Valves and Related Products decreased by $16 million, or 2%, to $805 million in 2014, including a core sales decline of $14 million, or 2%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $2 million, or 0.2%. The decrease in core sales reflected lower sales in chemical and oil and gas end markets, partially offset by higher sales in the general industrial end market. The lower sales in chemical and oil & gas end markets were primarily driven by project delays and lower investments in chemical and refining applications for our severe service valves. \n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Valves decreased by $3 million, or 1%, to $362 million in 2014, including unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, or 1%, as the Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a core sales increase of $2 million, or 0.4%. The increase in core sales was primarily driven higher sales to the commercial building construction end market in the United Kingdom. \n \u2022 Sales of Other Products decreased by $6 million, or 6%, in 2014 to $96 million, primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture of Crane Water.  Fluid Handling operating profit decreased by $13 million, or 7%, to $182 million in 2014 driven by an unfavorable product mix, the restructuring charge of $15 million recorded in 2014 and a $2 million impact from the lower sales, partially offset by productivity gains and lower pension expense.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPAYMENT & MERCHANDISING TECHNOLOGIES\n\n * The acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges are included in operating profit and operating margin. \n2015 compared with 2014\nPayment & Merchandising Technologies sales decreased by $9 million, or 1%, to $703 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $42 million, or 6%, and the impact of a transition services agreement related to a divested product line of $10 million, or 1%, partially offset by a core sales increase of $43 million, or 6%.\n \u2022 Sales of Payment Acceptance and Dispensing Products decreased $16 million, or 3%, to $496 million in 2015, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38 million, or 7%, as the British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, and euro weakened against the U.S. dollar and the aforementioned impact of a transition services agreement related to a divested product line which reduced sales by $10 million, or 2%. These decreases were partially offset by a core sales increase of $31 million, or 6%, reflecting higher sales in retail, gaming, vending, and transportation end markets, partially offset by lower sales to the financial services markets. \n \u2022 Sales of Merchandising Equipment increased $8 million, or 4%, to $207 million in 2015, reflecting a core sales increase of $11 million, or 6%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, or 2%, as the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar. The increase in core sales reflected higher sales to certain large bottler customers as well as full line operators in 2015.  Payment & Merchandising Technologies operating profit increased by $32 million, or 47%, to $101 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by the impact from higher core sales, a decrease in acquisition, integration and restructuring related charges of $17 million and synergy savings of $14 million, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.\n2014 compared with 2013\nPayment & Merchandising Technologies sales increased by $331 million, or 87%, to $712 million in 2014, reflecting sales related to the acquisition of MEI of $340 million, or 89%, partially offset by a core sales decline of $4 million, or 1%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, or 1%.\n \u2022 Sales of Payment Acceptance and Dispensing Products increased $312 million, or 155%, to $513 million in 2014, reflecting the aforementioned impact related to the acquisition of MEI of $340 million, or 169%, partially offset by a core sales decline of $22 million, or 11%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $6 million, or 3%, as the Canadian dollar and Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in core sales was driven by lower demand in the retail and gaming end markets, partially offset by strength in the financial services market. \n \u2022 Sales of Merchandising Equipment increased $20 million, or 11%, to 199 million, reflecting a core sales increase of $18 million, or 10%, and favorable currency translation of $2 million, or 1%. The increase in core sales reflected a return in capital spending by certain large bottler customers to 2012 levels.  Payment & Merchandising Technologies operating profit increased by $34 million, or 98%, to $69 million in 2014, primarily driven by the impact of the MEI acquisition, partially offset by an $18 million increase in acquisition, integration and restructuring-related charges in 2014.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAEROSPACE & ELECTRONICS\n\n * The restructuring and related charges are included in operating profit and operating margin. \n2015 compared with 2014\nAerospace & Electronics sales decreased $5 million, or 0.7%, to $691 million in 2015. The commercial market and military market accounted for 70% and 30%, respectively, of total segment sales in 2015. Sales to original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") and aftermarket customers were 73% and 27%, respectively, in 2015.\n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Original Equipment decreased by $1.4 million, or 0.4%, to $349 million in 2015. The sales decrease was driven by lower shipments to regional aircraft customers, lower engineering sales and lower sales for other commercial applications, partially offset by higher sales to manufacturers of large commercial transport aircrafts. \n \u2022 Sales of Military Original Equipment decreased by $6 million, or 4%, to $153 million in 2015. The sales decrease reflected lower build rates related to certain military platforms. \n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Aftermarket decreased by $2 million, or 1%, to $132 million in 2015. The sales decrease reflected lower sales to airlines and other aftermarket customers. \n \u2022 Sales of Military Aftermarket increased by $5 million, or 9%, to $57 million in 2015. The sales increase was driven by higher military modernization and upgrade product sales primarily associated with the B-52H brake control upgrade program for the U.S. Air Force.  Aerospace & Electronics operating profit increased by $7 million, or 5%, to $145 million in 2015, primarily as a result of strong productivity and repositioning benefits, a decrease in restructuring and related charges and a favorable product mix, partially offset by higher engineering expense.\n2014 compared with 2013\nAerospace & Electronics sales increased $2 million, or 0.3%, to $696 million in 2014. The commercial market and military market accounted for 70% and 30%, respectively, of total segment sales in 2014. Sales to OEM and aftermarket customers were 73% and 27%, respectively, in 2014.\n \u2022 Sales of Commercial Original Equipment increased by $10 million, or 3%, to $351 million in 2014. The sales increase was driven by higher sales to manufacturers of large commercial transport aircrafts as industry build rates increased. \n \u2022 Sales of Military Original Equipment decreased by $7 million, or 4%, to $159 million in 2014. The sales decrease reflected a decline in market demand for microwave components and lower product shipments for space applications.  Aerospace & Electronics operating profit decreased by $22 million, or 14%, to $138 million in 2014, primarily due to an increase in engineering and new product development spending supporting new program wins and higher costs associated with new product launches in our cabin business, restructuring and related charges of $8 million and an unfavorable product mix driven by stronger demand in early commercial programs which tend to carry lower margins, partially offset by productivity gains.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nENGINEERED MATERIALS\n\n2015 compared with 2014\nEngineered Materials sales increased by $2 million, or 1%, to $255 million in 2015.\n \u2022 Sales of Fiberglass-reinforced plastic panels (\"FRP\") to recreational vehicle (\"RV\") manufacturers increased slightly, resulting from higher sales of our RV-related applications as RV OEM build rates remained strong throughout 2015, primarily reflecting low fuel prices and continued low interest rates. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to building products customers increased $1 million, or 2%, to $83 million in 2015, reflecting a modest recovery in commercial construction end markets in the United States.  Engineered Materials operating profit increased by $12 million, or 32%, to $48 million in 2015, reflecting lower raw material costs, primarily resin, and strong productivity gains.\n2014 compared with 2013\nEngineered Materials sales increased by $21 million, or 9%, to $253 million in 2014.\n \u2022 Sales of FRP to RV manufacturers increased by $20 million, or 18%, to $134 million in 2014, reflecting higher demand for our RV-related applications as RV OEM build rates remained strong, with both dealer and retail demand continuing through 2014. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to building products customers decreased $2 million, or 3%, to $82 million in 2014, reflecting a slow recovery in commercial construction end markets in the United States. \n \u2022 Sales of FRP to transportation-related customers increased by $3 million, or 10%, to $38 million in 2014, reflecting higher sales in Latin America, timing of a large fleet build with one customer in North America and higher sales of aerodynamic side skirts for trailers.  Engineered Materials operating profit increased by $2 million, or 7%, to $37 million, in 2014, reflecting a $6 million impact from the higher sales and strong productivity gains, partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and higher raw material costs, primarily resin and substrates.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCORPORATE\n\n2015 compared with 2014\nTotal Corporate decreased by $62 million, or 56%, to $48 million in 2015, primarily due to the absence a $49 million charge related to an increase in the Company's liability at its Goodyear Site, a $6.8 million charge for expected remediation costs associated with our Roseland Site and a $6.5 million charge related to a lawsuit settlement recorded in 2014.\n2014 compared with 2013\nTotal Corporate increased by $33 million, or 45%, to $109 million in 2014, primarily due to the aforementioned $49 million charge related to our Goodyear Site, a $6.8 million charge related to our Roseland Site and a $6.5 million charge related to a lawsuit settlement. These increases were partially offset by $20.4 million lower MEI acquisition related costs in 2014 compared to 2013.\nIncome Tax\n\nOur effective tax rate is affected by a number of items, both recurring and discrete, including the amount of income we earn in different jurisdictions and their respective statutory tax rates, acquisitions and dispositions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, the continued availability of statutory tax credits and deductions, the continued reinvestment of our overseas earnings, and examinations initiated by tax authorities around the world. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies included later in this Item 7 for additional information about our provision for income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2015 compared with 2014\nOur effective tax rate was higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily because we earned a higher amount of income in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates, partially offset by a higher U.S. federal tax benefit from domestic manufacturing activities.\n2014 compared with 2013\nOur effective tax rate was lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily because our 2013 effective tax rate included the unfavorable effects of non-deductible transaction costs and withholding taxes related to the MEI acquisition. However, this was partially offset by less benefit from the U.S. federal research credit in 2014. While our 2014 effective tax rate includes one year's worth of benefit for the credit because it was extended during 2014 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2014, our 2013 effective tax rate included two years' worth of credit because it was extended during 2013 with retroactive effect to January 1, 2012.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur operating philosophy is to deploy cash provided from operating activities, when appropriate, to provide value to shareholders by reinvesting in existing businesses, by making acquisitions that will complement our portfolio of businesses, by divesting businesses that are no longer strategic and by paying dividends and/or repurchasing shares.\nOur current cash balance of $364 million, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and the $451 million available under our Commercial Paper (\"CP\") Program and revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to finance our short- and long-term capital requirements, as well as to fund payments associated with our asbestos and environmental liabilities, restructuring and acquisition integration activities and expected pension contributions. In addition, we believe our credit ratings afford us adequate access to public and private markets for debt. We have borrowings totaling $49.0 million outstanding under our CP Program as of December 31, 2015. There are no other significant debt maturities coming due until 2018.\nWe have an estimated liability of $546 million for pending and reasonably anticipated asbestos claims through 2021, and while it is probable that this amount will change and we may incur additional liabilities for asbestos claims after 2021, which additional liabilities may be material, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such additional liabilities at this time. Similarly, we have an estimated liability of $64 million related to environmental remediation costs projected through 2022 related to our Goodyear Site.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $358 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. Our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from our non-U.S. operations to fund our U.S. operations. In the event we were to repatriate the cash balances of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. and non-U.S. taxes in connection with such repatriation.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, a key source of our liquidity, was $229.3 million in 2015, compared to $264.0 million in 2014. The decrease primarily resulted from higher working capital requirements and higher environmental payments, partially offset by lower defined benefit plan and postretirement contributions and lower net asbestos-related payments. Net asbestos-related payments in 2015 and 2014 were $49.9 million and $61.3 million, respectively. In 2016, we expect to make payments related to asbestos settlement and defense costs, net of related insurance recoveries, of approximately $50 million, environmental payments of approximately $12 million and contributions to our defined benefit plans of approximately $8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash provided by divestitures of businesses or assets and cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities was $35.2 million in 2015, compared to $25.8 million in 2014. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the absence of proceeds from a 2014 purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition of MEI and the divestiture of a small business, coupled with lower proceeds from the disposition of capital assets. These were partially offset by lower capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information systems. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $50 million in 2016, reflecting anticipated increases in capital assets required to support product development initiatives, primarily in our Aerospace & Electronics segment.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, repayments of indebtedness, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for financing activities was $143.8 million in 2015, compared to $133.0 million in 2014. The higher levels of cash used for financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of outstanding indebtedness, partially offset by less cash used for open market share repurchases (we repurchased 398,095 shares of our common stock at a cost of $25 million in 2015 and 812,793 shares of our common stock at a cost of $50 million in 2014).\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancing Arrangements\nTotal debt was $799 million and $850 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\n \u2022 $250 million of 2.75% notes due 2018; \n \u2022 $300 million of 4.45% notes due 2023; \n \u2022 $199 million of 6.55% notes due 2036; \n \u2022 $49 million of borrowing outstanding under our commercial paper program; and \n \u2022 $1 million of other debt.  2.75% notes due 2018 - In December 2013, the Company issued five year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2018 and bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 2.92%.\n4.45% notes due 2023 - In December 2013, the Company issued 10 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations that mature on December 15, 2023 and bear interest at 4.45% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or part, at our option. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require us to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization, these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 4.56%.\n6.55% notes due 2036 - In November 2006, the Company issued 30 year notes having an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Company that mature on November 15, 2036 and bear interest at 6.55% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The notes have no sinking fund requirement, but may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company. These notes do not contain any material debt covenants or cross default provisions. If there is a change in control of the Company, and if as a consequence, the notes are rated below investment grade by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, then holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase them, in whole or in part, for 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Debt issuance costs are deferred and included in Other assets and then amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes. Including debt issuance cost amortization; these notes have an effective annualized interest rate of 6.67%.\nCommercial paper program - On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (the CP Program\u201d) pursuant to which it may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the Notes\u201d) pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $500 million. The Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issue. The Notes will rank at least pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, Notes with a principal amount of $49.0 million were outstanding. The net proceeds of the issuances of the Notes were used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nOther financing arrangements\nOn May 27, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment (\"Amendment No. 2\") to the Company's five-year, $500 million Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 2, among other things, (i) extends the maturity date under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to May 27, 2020 and (ii) amends the facility fee and applicable margins on the revolving loans made pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Following the effectiveness of Amendment No. 2, at the Company's current credit rating, the facility fee is reduced by 5 basis points to 0.15% while the applicable margin on revolving loans is increased by 5 basis points to 0.10% for base rate loans and 1.10% for LIBOR loans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn May 2012, the Company entered into a five year, $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as subsequently amended, and increased to $500 million, the facility\u201d), which is due to expire in May 2017. The facility allows the Company to borrow, repay, or to the extent permitted by the agreement, prepay and re-borrow funds at any time prior to the stated maturity date, and the loan proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes including financing for acquisitions. Interest is based on, at our option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company's credit rating (LIBOR plus 105 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of LIBOR plus 147.5 basis points), or (2) the greatest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points, plus a spread dependent on the Company's credit rating (5 basis points as of the date of this Report; up to a maximum of 47.5 basis points). At December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including the absence of a material adverse effect and limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and hedging arrangements. The facility also provides for customary events of default, including failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation or warranty made by us is false in any material respect, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, certain ERISA events, material judgments and a change in control of the Company. The facility contains a leverage ratio covenant requiring a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of less than or equal to 65%. At December 31, 2015, our ratio was 41%, as follows:\n\nAll outstanding senior, unsecured notes were issued under an indenture dated as of April 1, 1991. The indenture contains certain limitations on liens and sale and lease-back transactions.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had open standby letters of credit of $23 million issued pursuant to a $125 million uncommitted Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement, and certain other credit lines.\nCredit Ratings\nAs of December 31, 2015, our senior unsecured debt was rated BBB by Standard & Poor's with a Stable outlook and Baa2 with a Stable outlook by Moody's Investors Service. We believe that these ratings afford us adequate access to the public and private markets for debt.\nContractual Obligations\nUnder various agreements, we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts. These include payments under our long-term debt agreements and rent payments required under operating lease agreements. The following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) Excludes original issue discount. \n (2) Pension benefits are funded by the respective pension trusts. The postretirement benefit component of the obligation is approximately $1 million per year for which there is no trust and will be directly funded by us. Pension benefits are included through 2025. \n (3) As the timing of future cash outflows is uncertain, the following long-term liabilities (and related balances) are excluded from the above table: Long-term asbestos liability ($471 million), long-term environmental liability ($49 million) and gross unrecognized tax benefits ($45 million) and related gross interest and penalties ($6 million). \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCapital Structure\nThe following table sets forth our capitalization:\n\n * Net debt, a non-GAAP measure, represents total debt less cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $358 million of cash, which would be subject to additional tax upon repatriation to the United States. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include the presentation of net debt, provide useful information about our ability to satisfy our debt obligation with currently available funds. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. \n Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in the context of the definitions of the elements of such measures we provide and in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our reported results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nIn 2015, equity increased $80 million, primarily as a result of net income attributable to common shareholders of $229 million and stock option exercises of $11 million, partially offset by cash dividends of $77 million, changes in currency translation adjustment of $70 million, open-market share repurchases of $25 million and changes in pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit obligations, net of tax, of $8 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements, nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose off-balance sheet financing entities.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOUTLOOK\nOverall\nOur sales depend heavily on industries that are cyclical in nature or are subject to market conditions which may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable. Demand in these industries is affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors.\nWe remain generally cautious about global economic conditions and the demand for our products, particularly in our Fluid Handling segment. For 2016, we expect a total year-over-year sales decline of approximately 2% driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, with core sales approximately flat compared to 2015.\nConsistent with our focus on productivity, we undertook certain repositioning actions in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics segments in 2014 and 2015. The costs associated with these repositioning actions were $11.6 million in 2015 and $22.7 million in 2014. Savings associated with these repositioning actions were $14 million in 2015, and we expect incremental savings of $18 million in 2016.\nIn connection with the acquisition of MEI, we recorded $6.6 million in 2015 and $20.1 million of integration and restructuring costs in 2014. We realized approximately $10 million of acquisition-related synergies in 2014, $14 million in 2015, and we expect an incremental $9 million of synergies in 2016.\nFluid Handling\nIn 2016, we expect Fluid Handling sales to decline in the high single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a mid single-digit core sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nWe expect Process Valves and Related Products sales to decline in the low double-digit range compared to 2015, driven by a low double-digit sales decline and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Core sales are expected to decline because of slow economic growth and continued weakness in oil prices, which contribute to lower levels of customer capital spending and project delays across the power, oil & gas, chemical, and general industrial end markets.\nWe expect Commercial Valves sales to decline in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a slight improvement in core sales. Core sales are expected to improve slightly, driven by market share gains, largely offset by soft market conditions in the United Kingdom, Middle East, and Canadian non-residential construction markets.\nOur Other Products sales are expected to be approximately flat compared to 2015 given the relative stability of the U.S. municipal market.\nFor the segment, we expect a modest decline in operating profit compared to 2015, as the negative impact from lower core sales and unfavorable foreign currency will be partially offset by productivity initiatives, repositioning benefits, and lower repositioning costs.\nPayment & Merchandising Technologies\nWe expect Payment & Merchandising Technologies sales to increase in the low single-digit range compared to 2015, with a mid single-digit improvement in core sales partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. We expect core sales to improve across both CPI and Merchandising Systems. At CPI, we expect core sales improvement to be driven by several vertical end markets including transportation, vending, and financial services. At Merchandising Systems, we expect an improvement in core sales driven primarily by better demand from large bottler customers. We expect the segment's operating profit to increase compared to 2015 driven by the higher sales, integration synergies, and lower integration costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.\nAerospace & Electronics\nWe expect Aerospace & Electronics core sales to increase in the mid single-digit range compared to 2015. For 2016, we expect that commercial market conditions will remain generally positive. We expect commercial aftermarket sales to decline in the low single digit range primarily because of lower retrofit program sales. Although we expect defense markets to remain relatively flat, we expect our military sales to increase substantially as a result of a large contract for our microwave products, along with higher sales for a major military aerospace program. We expect segment operating profit in 2016 to improve slightly compared to 2015 driven by higher sales and repositioning benefits, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher engineering spending.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEngineered Materials\nIn 2016, we expect the Engineered Materials segment sales will be approximately flat compared to the prior year. We expect modest growth in sales to the RV and building products markets, offset by a decline in sales to the transportation market. Segment operating profit is expected to decline modestly, primarily from a contraction in the spread between raw material costs and pricing.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. The accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and, therefore, are critical to understanding our results of operations. We have discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition. Sales revenue is recorded when title (risk of loss) passes to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue on long-term, fixed-price contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all current industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to a one-year deferral of the effective date; the new standard is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption of the new revenue standard is permitted, however, entities reporting under U.S. GAAP are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date, December 15, 2016. The new standard can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.\nInventories. Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory values on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on historical performance and our forecast of product demand over the next two years. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $48.4 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), which requires an asset and liability approach for the financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These balances are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year(s) in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income taxes is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.\nBased on consideration of all available evidence regarding their utilization, we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Where, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that, in our judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The evidence we consider in reaching such conclusions includes, but is not limited to, (1) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, (3) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law, (4) cumulative losses in recent years, (5) a history of tax losses or credit carryforwards expiring unused, (6) a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief it limits realization of tax benefits, and (7) a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the carryforward and support showing that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition.\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nposition that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based solely on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn determining whether the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested overseas, we consider the following:\n \u2022 Our history of utilizing non-U.S. cash to acquire non-U.S. businesses, \n \u2022 Our current and future needs for cash outside the U.S. (e.g., to fund capital expenditures, business operations, potential acquisitions, etc.), \n \u2022 Our ability to satisfy U.S.-based cash needs (e.g., domestic pension contributions, interest payment on external debt, dividends to shareholders, etc.) with cash generated by our U.S. businesses, and \n \u2022 The effect U.S. tax reform proposals calling for reduced corporate income tax rates and/or repatriation\u201d tax holidays would have on the amount of the tax liability.  Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.168 billion of goodwill. Our business acquisitions typically result in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets. We follow the provisions under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d) as it relates to the accounting for goodwill in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These provisions require that we, on at least an annual basis, evaluate the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and attributed and compare that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing takes place more often than annually if events or circumstances indicate a change in the impairment status. A reporting unit is an operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment (a component\u201d), in which case the component would be the reporting unit. At December 31, 2015, we had seven reporting units.\nWhen performing our annual impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying value. Goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values are established primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital which varies for each reporting unit and which, as of our most recent annual impairment assessment, ranged between 10.0% and 12.5% (a weighted average of 10.8%), reflecting the respective inherent business risk of each of the reporting units tested. This methodology for valuing our reporting units (commonly referred to as the Income Method) has not changed since the prior year. The determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. In addition to the foregoing, for each reporting unit, market multiples are used to corroborate our discounted cash flow results where fair value is estimated based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples determined by available public information of comparable businesses. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical, reasonably possible 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The results of this hypothetical 10% decrease would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our carrying value for each of our reporting units. No impairment charges have been required during 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $317 million of net intangible assets, of which $27 million were intangibles with indefinite useful lives, consisting of trade names. We amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. If the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible exceeds the fair value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows.\nIn addition to annual testing for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we review all of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances could include, but are not\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nlimited to, a prolonged economic downturn, current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset or asset group, or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the long-lived asset (or asset group), as well as specific asset appraisal in certain instances. Reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other long-lived assets or asset groups and include consideration of estimated future revenues, gross profit margins, operating profit margins and capital expenditures which are based on the businesses' strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts, which change from year to year. The revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost increases/reductions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions, including changes in market conditions, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the long-lived asset is considered impaired and a charge would be taken against net earnings based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Judgments that we make which impact these assessments relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Such judgments are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in technology or development of alternative assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. Historical results to date have generally approximated expected cash flows for the identifiable cash flow generating level. We believe that there have been no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets below their carrying value.\nContingencies. The categories of claims for which we have estimated our liability, the amount of our liability accruals, and the estimates of our related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings and other contingencies. Please refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nAsbestos Liability and Related Insurance Coverage and Receivable. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos liability of $546 million for pending claims and future claims projected to be filed against us through December 31, 2021. Estimation of our exposure for asbestos-related claims is subject to significant uncertainties, as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing, severity and quantity of claims and the manner of their resolution. We have retained the firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. ( HR&A\u201d), a nationally recognized expert in the field, to assist management in estimating our asbestos liability in the tort system. HR&A reviews information provided by us concerning claims filed, settled and dismissed, amounts paid in settlements and relevant claim information such as the nature of the asbestos-related disease asserted by the claimant, the jurisdiction where filed and the time lag from filing to disposition of the claim. The methodology used by HR&A to project future asbestos costs is based largely on our experience during a base reference period of eleven quarterly periods (consisting of the two full preceding calendar years and three additional quarterly periods to the estimate date) for claims filed, settled and dismissed. Our experience is then compared to estimates of the number of individuals likely to develop asbestos-related diseases determined based on widely used previously conducted epidemiological studies augmented with current data inputs. Using that information, HR&A estimates the number of future claims that would be filed against us through our forecast period and estimates the aggregate settlement or indemnity costs that would be incurred to resolve both pending and future claims based upon the average settlement costs by disease during the reference period. Our liability estimate is augmented for the estimated cost of defending asbestos claims in the tort system. The most significant factors affecting the liability estimate are (1) the number of new mesothelioma claims filed against us, (2) the average settlement costs for mesothelioma claims, (3) the percentage of mesothelioma claims dismissed against us and (4) the aggregate defense costs incurred by us. These factors are interdependent, and no one factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Management believes that the level of uncertainty regarding the various factors used in estimating future asbestos costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for years beyond the indicated estimate. In addition to claim experience, we consider additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of the aging of pending claims, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, and their respective effects on expected future settlement values. Based on this evaluation, we determined that no change in the estimate was warranted for the period ended December 31, 2015. Nevertheless, if certain factors show a pattern of sustained increase or decrease, the liability could change materially; however, all the assumptions used in estimating the asbestos liability are interdependent and no single factor predominates in determining the liability estimate. Because of the uncertainty with regard to and the interdependency of such factors used in the calculation of our asbestos liability, and since no one factor predominates, we believe that a range of potential liability estimates beyond the indicated forecast period cannot be reasonably estimated.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn conjunction with developing the aggregate liability estimate referenced above, we also developed an estimate of probable insurance recoveries for our asbestos liabilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate asbestos receivable of $129 million. In developing this estimate, we considered our coverage-in-place and other settlement agreements, as well as a number of additional factors. These additional factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies, the method by which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies, how settlement and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships.\nEnvironmental. For environmental matters, we record a liability for estimated remediation costs when it is probable that we will be responsible for such costs and they can be reasonably estimated. Generally, third party specialists assist in the estimation of remediation costs. The environmental remediation liability at December 31, 2015 is substantially all for the Goodyear Site. Estimates of the Company's environmental liabilities at the Goodyear Site are based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations and current technology available for remediation, and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. These estimates consider the Company's prior experience in the Goodyear Site investigation and remediation, as well as available data from, and in consultation with, the Company's environmental specialists. Estimates at the Goodyear Site are subject to significant uncertainties caused primarily by the dynamic nature of the Goodyear Site conditions, the range of remediation alternatives available, together with the corresponding estimates of cleanup methodology and costs, as well as ongoing, required regulatory approvals, primarily from the EPA. During the third quarter of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision amendment requiring, among other things, additional source area remediation resulting in the Company recording a charge of $49.0 million, extending the accrued costs through 2022. As of December 31, 2015, the total estimated gross liability for the Goodyear Site was $64 million.\nOn July 31, 2006, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. Government reimburses us for 21% of qualifying costs of investigation and remediation activities at the Goodyear Site.\nPension Plans. In the United States, we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that covers approximately 19% of all U.S. employees. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a final average pay basis, except for certain hourly employees where benefits are fixed per year of service. This plan is funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by an independent actuary. Contributions are intended to provide for future benefits earned to date. A number of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately 11% of all non-U.S. employees. The benefits are typically based upon years of service and compensation. These plans are generally funded with trustees in respect to past and current service.\nThe expected return on plan assets component of Net Periodic Benefit Cost is determined by applying the assumed expected return on plan assets to the fair value of plan assets. For one of the U.K. pension plans, a market-related value of assets is used in lieu of the fair value of plan assets for this purpose. The net actuarial loss (gain) is amortized to the extent that it exceeds 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. The amortization period is the average life expectancy of plan participants for most plans. The amortization period for plans with a significant number of active participants accruing benefits is the average future working lifetime of plan participants. The prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the average future working lifetime of plan participants whose prior service benefits were changed.\nThe net periodic pension (benefit) cost was $(11) million, $(12) million and $5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net periodic pension benefit was $1 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. The reasons for the difference between the net periodic pension benefit gain of $12 million in 2014, and the $5 million loss in 2013, included the return on plan assets in 2013 being $56 million higher than expected ($13 million reduction in net periodic benefit cost), as well as closure of certain defined benefit plans in our U.K. operations recognized at the end of 2013 ($5 million reduction in net periodic benefit costs). In the United States, the increase in discount rate from 4.20% to 4.90% also contributed to the gain of $12 million. Employer cash contributions were $17 million, $24 million and $15 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. We expect, based on current actuarial calculations, to contribute cash of approximately $8 million to our pension plans in 2016. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets.\nFor the pension plan, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of plan assets by 0.25 percentage points would have increased U.S. 2015 pension expense by $1.0 million for U.S. pension plans and $1.1 million for non-U.S. pension plans. Also, holding all other factors constant, a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension cost by 0.25 percentage points would have increased 2015 pension expense by $0.2 million for U.S. pension plans and $0.9 million for non-U.S. pension plans.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following key assumptions were used to calculate the benefit obligation and net periodic cost for the periods indicated:\n\nThe long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumptions were determined with input from independent investment consultants and plan actuaries, utilizing asset pricing models and considering historic returns. The discount rates we used for valuing pension liabilities are based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 33:

unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower core sales in the Fluid Handling segment. Operating profit increased 18% to $373 million due to absence of prior year environmental charges. \n\n- Fluid Handling segment sales fell 14% in 2015 driven by lower demand in oil & gas and general industrial markets. Payment & Merchandising sales declined 1% due to currency headwinds but core sales rose 6%. Aerospace & Electronics sales fell slightly. Engineered Materials sales rose 1%.\n\n- Pension plans had a net periodic benefit of $11 million in 2015 compared to $12 million in 2014. Discount rates and expected returns on assets are key assumptions driving pension expense.\n\n- Asbestos liability is estimated at $546 million through 2021 based on modeling of claims experience and epidemiological studies. Environmental liability of $64 million is accrued for Goodyear site through 2022.\n\n- For 2016, total sales are expected to decline 2% with flat core sales due to currency headwinds. Fluid Handling sales likely to decline high single digits. Profitability expected lower in Fluid Handling but higher in other segments.\n\nIn summary, the company faced sales headwinds in 2015 but improved profitability through restructuring and absence of charges. Pension expense minimal. Key liabilities for asbestos and environmental sites were updated. 2016 sales will continue to face currency and oil & gas market challenges."}
