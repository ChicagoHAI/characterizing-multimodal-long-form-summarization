Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2017 EQT Highlights:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Closed the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Achieved annual production sales volumes of 887.5 Bcfe, 17% higher than 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) totaling $3.0 billion\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Received FERC Certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation for 2017 was $1,508.5 million, $8.04 per diluted share, compared with a loss attributable to EQT Corporation of $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, in 2016. The $1,961.5 million increase in net income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recorded as a result of the lower federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018, the result of a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 compared to a loss in 2016, a 23% increase in the average realized price, a 17% increase in production sales volumes, and higher pipeline, water and net marketing services, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher interest expense, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a loss on debt extinguishment in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded acquisition expenses of approximately $237.3 million related to the Rice Merger, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement. Additional expenses were for investment banking, legal and other professional fees. Acquisition costs are reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nEQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues.\nNet loss attributable to EQT Corporation for 2016 was $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to EQT Corporation of $85.2 million, $0.56 per diluted share, in 2015. The $538.2 million decrease in income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, a 20% decrease in the average realized price, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes and lower income tax expense.\nEQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP\noperating revenues.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016. The impairment was a result of a reduction in estimated future cash flows caused by the low commodity price environment and the related reduced producer drilling activity and throughput. This impairment is reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nSee Business Segment Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of items impacting operating income, Other Income Statement Items\u201d for a discussion of other income, interest expense, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and Investing Activities\u201d under the caption Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of capital expenditures.\nConsolidated Operational Data\nThe following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the Company's consolidated operations, including the calculation of the Company's average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Production total operating revenues. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of EQT Production\nadjusted operating revenues to EQT Production total operating revenues and Note 6 to the Consolidated

Production includes the results of production operations acquired in the Rice Merger for the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported under EQT Production Results of Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of EQT Production operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQT Production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues also excludes \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production. \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to third parties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volumes. Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of EQT Production adjusted operating revenues\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands (unless noted)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQT Production total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,106,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,387,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,131,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Deduct) add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td>(390,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(385,762\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td>40,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the year\n</td> <td>2,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline and net marketing services\n</td> <td>(64,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,048\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,694,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,872,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales volumes (MMcfe)\n</td> <td>887,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>758,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price ($/Mcfe)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nBusiness segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company's consolidated results based on operating income. Other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters' costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters' annual operating budget. Unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation and administrative costs. In 2017, unallocated expenses also included the Rice Merger acquisition related expenses of $237.3 million, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement as well as investment banking, legal and other professional fees. In 2016, unallocated expenses also included an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016.\nThe Company has reported the components of each segment's operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQT's management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQT's business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to the Rice Merger, the Company reported its results of operations through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission. These reporting segments reflected the Company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the Company evaluated its operating performance through September 30, 2017. Following the Rice Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure to incorporate the newly acquired assets. The Company now conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering (formerly known as EQT Gathering), EQM Transmission (formerly known as EQT Transmission), RMP Gathering and RMP Water. The EQT Production segment includes the Company's production activities, including those acquired in the Rice Merger, the Company's marketing operations and certain gathering operations primarily supporting the Company's production activities, including the Rice retained gathering assets. The EQM Gathering segment and the EQM Transmission segment include all of the Company's assets and operations that are owned by EQM; therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the same as EQM's disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The RMP Gathering segment contains the Company's gathering assets that are owned by RMP. The RMP Water segment contains the Company's water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities owned by RMP. Following the Rice Merger, the financial and operational disclosures related to RMP Gathering and RMP Water will be the same as RMP's successor disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEQT Production\nResults of Operations Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

See Note 2 for a discussion of the Rice Merger.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nEQT Production's operating income totaled $589.7 million for 2017 compared to operating loss of $719.7 million for 2016. The $1,309.4 million increase was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to losses on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016, higher average realized price and increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs, partly offset by increased operating expenses. These variances include the impact of the operations of Rice for the period subsequent to the Rice Merger, which added approximately $165.6 million of operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $114.6 million in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nTotal operating revenues were $3,106.3 million for 2017 compared to $1,387.1 million for 2016. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs increased as a result of a higher average realized price and a 17% increase in production sales volumes in 2017. EQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. Changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of recent acquisition activity, including the Rice Merger, as well as increased production from the 2015 and 2016 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells in 2017.\nThe $0.57 per Mcfe increase in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the increase in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.29 per Mcf, an increase in the average natural gas differential of $0.19 per Mcf and an increase in liquids prices. The improvement in the average differential primarily related to more favorable basis partly offset by unfavorable cash settled basis swaps. During 2017, basis improved in the Appalachian Basin and at sales points reached through the Company's transportation portfolio, particularly in the United States Northeast. In addition, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The $24.0 million increase in these revenues primarily related to increased gathering revenues for services provided to third parties on gathering lines acquired from Rice in addition to costs, net of recoveries, for the Company's Rockies Express Pipeline capacity in 2016.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $390.0 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to increases in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps due to decreased NYMEX prices, partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of its basis swaps due to increased basis prices.\nGathering expense increased due to increased affiliate and third party gathering capacity. The Rice Merger increased affiliate gathering expense as a result of volumes gathered by RMP Gathering which added approximately $21.0 million of expense for the post-Rice Merger period. In addition, EQT Production increased firm gathering capacity on the affiliate gathering systems owned by EQM Gathering in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. The Company's 2016 and 2017 acquisitions, excluding Rice, added third party gathering capacity and expense. Transmission expense increased due to increased third party capacity and increased firm contracts with affiliates incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin. During the fourth quarter of 2016, EQM's Ohio Valley Connector (OVC) was placed into service and as a result, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity. Additionally, the Company's firm capacity on Rockies Express pipeline increased in the first quarter of 2017. Firm capacity acquired in connection with the Rice Merger also increased transmission expenses by approximately $24.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity. Processing expense increased 44% as a result of increased processing capacity acquired through recent acquisitions and higher volumes processed, which is consistent with higher ethane and NGLs sales volumes of approximately 50% during 2017.\nThe increase in LOE was primarily due to higher salt water disposal costs. Production taxes increased as a result of higher market prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 in combination with an increase in the number of wells drilled in Pennsylvania and an increase in production volumes from recent acquisitions.\nExploration expense increased primarily due to expenses related to an exploratory well in a non-core operating area classified as a dry hole in 2017.\nSG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower pension expense of $9.4 million related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees in the second quarter of 2016, lower legal reserves in 2017, a reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and the absence of costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations in 2016. This was partly offset by higher costs associated with recent acquisitions.\nDD&A expense increased on higher production depletion as a result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2017. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Rice Merger in 2017.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2016 impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The Company did not identify any such leases in 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nEQT Production's operating loss totaled $719.7 million for 2016 compared to operating income of $132.0 million for 2015. The $851.7 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2016 compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015, a lower average realized price, increased operating expenses and decreased pipeline and net marketing services partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs.\nTotal operating revenues were $1,387.1 million for 2016 compared to $2,131.7 million for 2015. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes in 2016. EQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells.\nThe $0.62 per Mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.53 per Mcf and a decrease in the average\nnatural gas differential of $0.12 per Mcf. The decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps. While Appalachian Basin basis improved slightly for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, basis in the United States Northeast was significantly lower, particularly in the\nfirst quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions. Additionally, the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year. The Company started flowing EQT Production's produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the Company's Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to an $385.8 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps, partly offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of its basis swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2016, forward NYMEX prices increased while basis prices decreased.\nOperating expenses totaled $2,114.8 million for 2016 compared to $1,999.7 million for 2015. The increase in operating\nexpenses primarily resulted from increases in DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing, partly offset by reductions in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and exploration expense. Gathering expense increased due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and due to increased third party volumetric charges. Transmission expense increased as a result of higher third party costs incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin and increased affiliate firm capacity charges. Processing expenses increased due to higher production volumes.\nThe decrease in LOE was primarily due to lower salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the Marcellus Shale and certain operational cost savings in the Huron operations, partly offset by costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations. Production taxes were essentially flat as a higher Pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax settlement were offset by lower unhedged sales prices, a favorable property tax settlement and the expiration of the West Virginia volume based tax in 2016. The state of West Virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per Mcf additional volume based severance tax that was terminated on July 1, 2016.\nExploration expense was lower primarily due to a decrease in lease expirations related to acreage that the Company does not intend to drill prior to expiration and expenses related to exploratory wells in 2015. SG&A expense increased due to higher litigation costs, a $9.4 million charge related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees incurred in 2016, an increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and non-recurring costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations and acquisition related expenses in 2016. These increases were partly offset by drilling program reduction charges in the Permian and Huron Basins in 2015, decreased personnel costs, decreased professional service costs and charges to write off expired right of ways options in 2015. The increase in depletion expense within DD&A expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2016. Depreciation expense within DD&A increased as a result of additional assets in service.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 impairment charge primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the Permian Basin of Texas and impairments of proved properties in the Utica Shale of Ohio, as well as unproved property impairments and impairment of field level NGLs processing equipment that was not being used. The proved properties impairments in 2015 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development. The 2016 and 2015 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus near-term development activities in the Company's Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica acreage.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQM

Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of third parties and affiliates contracting for additional firm gathering capacity, which increased firm gathering capacity by approximately 475 MMcf per day following the completion of the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects. The decrease in usage fees under firm contracts was due to lower affiliate volumes in excess of firm contracted capacity. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to the additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily as a result of higher personnel costs and increased property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects partly offset by increased miscellaneous administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.4 million due to additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nGathering revenues increased by $62.4 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered in\n2016 compared to 2015, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately 300 MMcf per day following the completion of the Northern West Virginia gathering system (NWV Gathering) and Jupiter gathering system (Jupiter) expansion projects in the\nfourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT.

million. Firm reservation fee revenues increased due to affiliates and third parties contracting for additional firm capacity, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. The firm capacity on the OVC resulted in lower affiliate usage fees under firm contracts. The increase in usage fees under interruptible contracts includes increased storage and parking revenue, which does not have pipeline throughput associated with it, partly offset by reduced throughput on interruptible contracts.\nOperating expenses increased by $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily due to property taxes on the OVC and higher personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of the OVC project placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense of $10.5 million related to the revaluation of differences between the regulatory and tax bases in EQM's regulated property, plant and equipment. The related regulatory liability will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the underlying property which is 43 years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues increased by $40.3 million. Firm reservation revenues increased due to affiliates contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in 2016. Higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased as a result of higher third party volumes transported or stored on an interruptible basis.\nOperating expenses increased by $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted primarily from higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of higher depreciation on the increased investment in transmission infrastructure, including those associated with the OVC and the AVC facilities.\nRMP Gathering\nResults of Operations\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The majority of RMP Water's services are provided to EQT Production. RMP Water offers its services on a volumetric basis, supported by an acreage dedication from EQT Production for certain drilling areas. RMP Water charges customers a fee per gallon of water; this fee is tiered and thus is lower on a per gallon basis once the customer meets certain volumetric thresholds.

Decreased capitalized interest of $13.3 million and additional interest expense of approximately $3.3 million related to EQM's $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes issued during the fourth quarter of 2016 were mostly offset by higher interest income earned on short-term investments of $6.7 million, lower interest expense resulting from the Company's repayment of $160.0 million of debt that matured in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower\nEQM revolver fees.\nThe weighted average annual interest rates on the weighted average principal outstanding of the Company's Senior Notes, excluding EQM's Senior Notes, were 5.6%, 6.5%, and 6.5% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As a result of the change in the corporate tax rate, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue its existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower rate.\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDCs) in the year incurred. IDCs, however, have historically been limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and this has resulted in the Company paying AMT even when generating or utilizing a net operating loss carryforward (NOL) to offset regular taxable income.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation also repealed the AMT for tax years beginning January 1, 2018 and provides that existing AMT credit carryforwards can be utilized to offset current federal tax liability in tax years 2018 through 2020. In addition, 50% of any unused AMT credit carryforwards can be refunded during these years with any remaining AMT credit carryforward being fully refunded in 2021. The Company had approximately $435 million of AMT credit carryforward as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation preserved deductibility of IDCs, and provides for 100% bonus depreciation on some tangible property expenditures through 2022.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, but has recorded provisional amounts for the revaluing of net deferred tax liabilities as well as the state income tax effects related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax amounts will be recovered in future periods under this legislation. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation and refining calculations, which could potentially impact the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAll of EQGP's, RMP's and Strike Force Midstream's income is included in the Company's pre-tax income (loss). However, the Company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of EQGP's and RMP's income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of EQGP, EQM, and RMP or to the minority owner of Strike Force Midstream, which reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income and increases the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax loss.\nFor 2017 and 2016, the Company generated a federal taxable loss and the Company paid AMT in 2016. The federal and AMT NOLs generated by the taxable losses for 2017 and 2016 will be carried back to 2015 and 2014 to generate a tax refund from 2015 and an increase in AMT credit carryforwards for those years. The Company paid federal income tax in 2015 as a result of tax gains related to EQGP's IPO and the sale of NWV Gathering to EQM during that year.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's income tax (benefit) expense, including a reconciliation between income tax expense calculated at the current federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate reflected in the Company's financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of higher net income at EQM and noncontrolling interests in RMP and Strike Force Midstream as a result of the Rice Merger. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of increased net income at EQM, increased ownership of EQM common units by third parties and EQGP's IPO in 2015.\nOutlook\nThe Company's board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the Company's sum-of-the-parts discount. The board will announce a decision by the end of March, 2018, after considering the committee's recommendation.\nThe Company is committed to profitably and safely developing its Appalachian Basin natural gas and NGL reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling. The Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's substantial resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including its commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. The Company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area.\nThe Company monitors current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly. While the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the Company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into the highest value development opportunities. Upon the closing of the Rice Merger, the Company's consolidation goals were largely met and the Company plans to focus on integrating the Rice assets and realizing higher returns through longer laterals and achieving an even lower operating cost structure. The Company will also continue to pursue tactical acquisitions of fill-in acreage to extend laterals and has announced its intention to sell the Rice retained midstream assets to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions.\nEQT Production expects to spend approximately $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) in 2018, which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195 gross wells, including 134 Marcellus wells, 16 Upper Devonian wells and 45 Ohio Utica wells. The Company also intends to spend approximately $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. Estimated sales volumes are expected to be 1,520 - 1,560 Bcfe for 2018.\nThe 2018 drilling program is expected to support a 15% increase in production sales volume in 2019 over our 2018 expected sales volumes with total NGLs volumes expected to be 12,300 - 12,600 Mbbls. To support continued growth in production, the Company plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure through EQM in 2018, including capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $1.1 billion. RMP investments in organic projects are expected to total approximately $260 million in 2018, including $215 million for gathering and compression and $45 million for water infrastructure.\nThe 2018 capital investment plan for EQT Production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and cash on hand. EQM's available sources of liquidity include cash on hand and generated from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership interests. RMP's 2018 capital investment plan is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility.\nThe Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves of, natural gas and NGLs. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the Company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including Appalachian and other market point basis, and NGLs and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations.\nThe Company's 2018 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 59% higher than its 2017 well development spending. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices could affect, among other things, the Company's development plans, which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the Company's reserves, as well as the Company's revenues, earnings or liquidity. Lower prices could also result in non-cash impairments in the book value of the Company's oil and gas\nproperties, goodwill or other long lived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the Company's estimated proved reserves. Any such impairment and/or downward adjustment to the Company's estimated reserves could potentially be material to the Company.\nImpairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the Company's oil and gas properties. Due to declines in the five-year NYMEX forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016, the Company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the Company's proved oil and gas properties in those years. No indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2017. Although the Company did not have indicators of impairment or record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2017, all other things being equal, a further decline in the average five-year NYMEX forward strip price in a future period may cause the Company to recognize impairments on non-core assets, including the Company's assets in the Huron play, which had a carrying value of approximately $3 billion at December 31, 2017.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to evaluating the Company's goodwill for impairment. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2017 and determined there was no indicator of impairment. We use a combination of the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate, different estimates and assumptions could materially impact the calculated fair value of the reporting units. Additionally, future results could differ from our current estimates and assumptions. Any potential change in such estimates and assumptions would have an impact on the results of operations and financial position. Due to the uncertainty inherent in, and the interdependence of, the assumptions of underlying assets and goodwill impairment determinations, the Company cannot predict if future impairment charges will be recognized and, if so, an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period.\nSee Natural gas, NGLs and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our non-core assets. Future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, adverse changes in well performance or impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\u201d under Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's primary sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), borrowings on credit facilities and cash flows from operating activities, while the primary uses of cash were for redemptions and repayments of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, capital expenditures, the cash portion of the Merger Consideration for the Rice Merger, and redemptions of Company Senior Notes.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities increased $573.4 million from full year 2016 to full year 2017. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" and \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" sections herein and the timing of payments between the two periods, partly offset by lower cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $152.6 million from full year 2015 to full year 2016. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a lower commodity price and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher production sales volumes, cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, decreases in cash paid for income taxes and the timing of payments between periods.\nThe Company's cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities. The Company is unable to predict these future price movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. Refer to \"Natural gas, NGLs and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position.\" under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for further information.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $4,127.1 million for 2017 as compared to $2,961.5 million for 2016. The $1,165.6 million increase was primarily due to investment in the Rice Merger, an increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions spending, and higher capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions, cash received from the sale of trading securities and lower EQM capital expenditures.\nOn November 13, 2017, in conjunction with the Rice Merger, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Rice (the Rice Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive 0.37 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company (Company Common Stock) and $5.30 in cash (collectively, the Merger Consideration). The aggregate Merger Consideration consisted of approximately 91 million shares of Company Common Stock and approximately $1.6 billion in cash (net of cash acquired and inclusive of amounts payable to employees of Rice who did not continue with the Company following the Effective Time). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Rice Merger.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,961.5 million for 2016 as compared to $2,525.6 million for 2015. The $435.9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of $1,051.2 million and investments in trading securities of $288.8 million, partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures. During 2016, the Company invested in trading securities, which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value, to maximize returns. The Company also placed $75.0 million of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential like-kind exchange for tax purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\n(in millions)\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well development (primarily drilling and completion)\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property acquisitions\n</td> <td>1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Production infrastructure\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQM Gathering\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQM Transmission\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RMP Gathering\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RMP Water\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-cash *\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total cash capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Represents the net impact of non-cash capital expenditures including capitalized non-cash stock-based compensation expense and accruals. The impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate, both of which are non-cash items. The year ended December 31, 2017 included $10.0 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2017 acquisitions and $(14.3) million of measurement period adjustments for 2016 acquisitions. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $87.6 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2016 acquisitions.\nThe Company has forecast a 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $2.4 billion for EQT Production, which includes $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) and $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. The Company has also forecast an EQM 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure including capital contributions to MVP and an RMP 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $260 million for gathering infrastructure and water infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $1,385 million and $783 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company spud 201 gross wells in 2017, including 144 horizontal Marcellus wells, 49 horizontal Upper Devonian wells, seven horizontal Ohio Utica wells and one other well. The Company spud 135 gross wells in 2016, including 117 horizontal Marcellus wells, 13 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 horizontal Utica wells. The increase in capital expenditures for well development in 2017 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years and an increase in\nwells spud. Capital expenditures for 2017 also included $1,007 million for property acquisitions, compared to $1,284 million of capital expenditures in 2016 for property acquisitions. These acquisitions are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $783 million and $1,670 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company spud 161 gross wells in 2015, including 133 horizontal Marcellus wells, 24 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 other wells, including 2 Utica wells. The decrease in capital expenditures for well development in 2016 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years, a decrease in wells spud, lower costs per well and operational efficiencies. Capital expenditures for 2016 also included $1,284 million for property acquisitions, compared to $182 million of capital expenditures in 2015 for property acquisitions. The Company executed multiple large transactions during 2016 that resulted in the Company's acquisition of approximately 122,100 net Marcellus acres located primarily in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for the EQM gathering and transmission operations totaled $308 million for 2017 and $587 million for 2016, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures. Expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that EQM expects to increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. This decrease in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to OVC, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCapital expenditures for the gathering, transmission and storage operations totaled $430 million for 2015, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,533.1 million for 2017 as compared to $1,399.5 million for 2016. During 2017, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and borrowings on credit facilities. The primary financing uses of cash during 2017 were redemptions and repayment of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, redemption of the Company's Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable March 1, 2018, to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQGP's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.244 per common unit, or approximately $64.9 million. The cash distribution will be paid on February 23, 2018 to unitholders of record, including the Company, at the close of business on February 2, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQM's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQM's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.025 per common unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by EQM to EQGP were approximately $65.7 million consisting of: $22.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest, $2.2 million in respect of its general partner interest and $41.1 million in respect of its IDRs in EQM.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of RMP's general partner declared a cash distribution to RMP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.2917 per common and subordinated unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including Rice Midstream GP Holdings, LP (RMGP), which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by RMP to RMGP were approximately $11.4 million, consisting of $8.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest and $3 million in respect of its IDRs in RMP.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,399.5 million for 2016 as compared to $1,832.5 million for 2015. During 2016, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock and from EQM's public offerings of common units under EQM's $750 million at-the-market (ATM) common unit offering program (the EQM $750 Million ATM Program), as well as proceeds received from the issuance of EQM Senior Notes. The primary financing uses of cash during 2016 were net credit facility repayments under the EQM credit facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards and dividends. In 2015, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were the issuance of EQM and EQGP common units and net borrowings on EQM's credit facility while the primary uses of financing cash flows were repayments of Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nEQT primarily utilizes borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until the expenditures can be permanently financed and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. Margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices, the Company's credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also borrowed under the Company's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the cash Merger Consideration and pay expenses related to the Rice Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017, certain existing letters of credit issued for the account of Rice and its subsidiaries were transferred to the Company's $2.5 billion credit facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of EQT's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurity Ratings and Financing Triggers\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2017. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Company's cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under its lines of credit. These ratings may also affect collateral requirements under derivative instruments, pipeline capacity contracts, joint venture arrangements and subsidiary construction contracts, rates available on new long-term debt and access to the credit markets.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior\nNotes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service (Moody's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Service (S&P)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of EQM at December 31, 2017.

The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Company's or EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on the Company's derivative contracts would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances, including collateral, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin on the Company's derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating, such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated BBB- or higher by S&P, Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Company's credit facility contains financial covenants that require a\ntotal debt-to-total capitalization ratio no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nEQM's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Under EQM's $1 billion credit facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of December 31, 2017, EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nThe RMP credit facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreement, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the RMP credit facility relate to maintenance of certain financial ratios, as described below, limitations on certain investments and acquisitions, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The RMP credit facility requires RMP to maintain the following financial ratios:\n\u2022an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.50 to 1.0;\n\u2022a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.0, and after electing to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 5.25 to 1.0 (with certain increases for measurement periods following the completion of certain acquisitions); and\n\u2022if RMP elects to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2017, RMP and RMP OpCo were in compliance with all credit facility provisions and covenants.\nEQM ATM Program\nDuring 2015, EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the EQM $750 million ATM Program. EQM had approximately $443 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nRMP ATM Program\nDuring 2016, RMP entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the RMP $100 million ATM equity distribution program. RMP had approximately $83.7 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nCommodity Risk Management\nThe substantial majority of the Company's commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the Company's produced natural gas. The Company's overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily NYMEX swaps, collars and options.\nAs of January 31, 2018, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company's derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 (a)(b)(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NYMEX Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Puts (Long)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Full year 2018\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>The Company also sold calendar year 2018 and 2019 calls for approximately 64 Bcf and 45 Bcf, respectively, at strike prices of $3.49 per Mcf and $3.69 per Mcf, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (c) For 2018, the Company also sold puts for approximately 3 Bcf at a strike price of $2.63 per Mcf.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery. The difference between these sales prices and NYMEX are included in average differential on the Company's price reconciliation under \"Consolidated Operational Data\". The Company has fixed price physical sales for 2018 and 2019 of 121 Bcf and 37 Bcf, respectively, at average NYMEX prices of $2.93 per Mcf and $3.04 per Mcf, respectively. For 2018, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.88 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 49 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $3.36 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company also has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX floor price of $2.16 per Mcf and a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.47 per Mcf. Currently, the Company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its NGLs exposure. The Company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy.\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's hedging program.\nOther Items\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy-efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately $95 million as of December 31, 2017, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 11 years.\nAs of December 31, 2017, EQM had issued a $91 million performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP.\nThe NORESCO guarantees and the MVP Guarantee are exempt from ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees.\nRate Regulation\nAs described under Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business,\u201d the Company's transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. See Our need to comply with comprehensive, complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.\u201d in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for potential risks related to the regulation of rates by the FERC.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe table below presents the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 in total and by periods. Purchase obligations exclude the Company's contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with EQM, for which future payments related to such agreements totaled $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. These capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years. Purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture and purchase obligations of the MVP Joint Venture.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,616,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,045,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,004,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,742,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,618,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,711,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,524,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on Senior Notes (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,515,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility borrowings (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,761,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,475,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water infrastructure (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities (f)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,841,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,604,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,364,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,696,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various unconsolidated pipelines, including commitments from the Company to the MVP Joint Venture, some of which extend up to 20 years or longer.

The Company has agreements with several drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company over the next four years. These obligations totaled approximately $92.3 million as of December 31, 2017.

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 of $301.6 million, of which $84.1 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe Company's recently issued accounting standards are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.\nThe carrying values of the Company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a field-by-field basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves, utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the Company's management for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil, adjusted accordingly for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation, some of which are interdependent. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.\nCapitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and NGLs, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and NGLs recorded and the timing of those recoveries. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Company's engineers and audited by the Company's independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, operating costs, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the Company's financial statements.\nThe Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period, which is subject to change in subsequent periods. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates, production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above for additional information regarding the Company's oil and gas reserves.\nIncome Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state NOL carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, other federal tax credit carryforwards, incentive compensation and investment in partnerships. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state NOL carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in Note 11 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the Company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. In making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Company's or counterparty's credit rating and the yield of a risk-free instrument, and\ncredit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, or market conditions or other factors change, many of which are beyond the Company's control.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company's financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the Company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, both NYMEX and basis. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nContingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results.\nThe Company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Company's plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud. The Company operates and maintains its gathering systems and transmission and storage system and it intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. The Company is under no legal or contractual obligation to restore or dismantle its gathering systems and transmission and storage system upon abandonment. Therefore, the Company does not have any asset retirement obligations related to its gathering systems and transmission and storage system as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nShare-Based Compensation: The Company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plans. Awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted units and stock options. Awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.\nRestricted units and performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards. For liability awards, the Company is required to estimate, on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the Company's common stock on, the vesting date. The Company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. The Company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.\nPerformance-based awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are treated as equity awards. For equity awards, the Company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. Determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Most often, the Company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.\nFor time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, historically three years. For director phantom units (which vest on the date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the year of grant. The grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.\nFor non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically three years. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are critical accounting estimates\u201d because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Company's common stock. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's share-based compensation.\nBusiness Combinations: Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value.\nThe most significant assumptions in a business combination include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. The fair value of proved natural gas properties is determined using a risk-adjusted after-tax discounted cash flow analysis based upon significant assumptions including commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; timing and amount of future development and operating costs; projected reserve recovery factors; and a weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company utilizes the guideline transaction method to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination which requires the Company to use judgment in considering the value per undeveloped acre in recent comparable transactions to estimate the value of unproved properties.\nThe estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, generally consisting of pipeline systems and compression stations, is estimated using the cost approach, which incorporates assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence.\nThe fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using the multi-period excess earnings model which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the intangible asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized. The Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.\nThe Rice Merger resulted in share-based compensation modification accounting which is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grant-date fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award. The calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new (modified) award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original option measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must, in determining the fair value of assets acquired, make assumptions about future commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs; and projections of reserve recovery factors, per acre values of undeveloped property, replacement cost of and future cash flows from midstream assets, cash flow from customer relationships and non-compete agreements and the pre and post modification value of stock based awards. Different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets which would impact the Company's financial position and future results of operations.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company may first consider qualitative factors to assess whether there are indicators that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may not exceed its carrying amount. To the extent that such indicators exist, a two-step goodwill impairment test is completed. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nthe second step is required which compares the implied fair value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to goodwill are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate; however, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the calculated fair value and the resulting determinations about goodwill impairment which could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, future estimates may differ materially from current estimates and assumptions.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2017 EQT Highlights:\n \u2022 Closed the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017 \n \u2022 Achieved annual production sales volumes of 887.5 Bcfe, 17% higher than 2016 \n \u2022 Completed the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) totaling $3.0 billion \n \u2022 Received FERC Certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline \nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation for 2017 was $1,508.5 million, $8.04 per diluted share, compared with a loss attributable to EQT Corporation of $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, in 2016. The $1,961.5 million increase in net income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recorded as a result of the lower federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018, the result of a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 compared to a loss in 2016, a 23% increase in the average realized price, a 17% increase in production sales volumes, and higher pipeline, water and net marketing services, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher interest expense, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a loss on debt extinguishment in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded acquisition expenses of approximately $237.3 million related to the Rice Merger, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement. Additional expenses were for investment banking, legal and other professional fees. Acquisition costs are reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nEQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues.\nNet loss attributable to EQT Corporation for 2016 was $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to EQT Corporation of $85.2 million, $0.56 per diluted share, in 2015. The $538.2 million decrease in income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, a 20% decrease in the average realized price, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes and lower income tax expense.\nEQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP\noperating revenues.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016. The impairment was a result of a reduction in estimated future cash flows caused by the low commodity price environment and the related reduced producer drilling activity and throughput. This impairment is reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nSee Business Segment Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of items impacting operating income, Other Income Statement Items\u201d for a discussion of other income, interest expense, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and Investing Activities\u201d under the caption Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of capital expenditures.\nConsolidated Operational Data\nThe following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the Company's consolidated operations, including the calculation of the Company's average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Production total operating revenues. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of EQT Production\nadjusted operating revenues to EQT Production total operating revenues and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Basis represents the difference between the ultimate sales price for natural gas and the NYMEX natural gas price.\n(c) NGLs, ethane and crude oil were converted to Mcfe at the rate of six Mcfe per

Production includes the results of production operations acquired in the Rice Merger for the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported under EQT Production Results of Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of EQT Production operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQT Production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues also excludes \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production. \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to third parties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volumes. Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calculation of EQT Production adjusted operating revenues\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$ in thousands (unless noted)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQT Production total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,106,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,387,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,131,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Deduct) add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td>(390,021\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(385,762\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges\n</td> <td>40,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the year\n</td> <td>2,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline and net marketing services\n</td> <td>(64,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,048\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,542\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,694,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,872,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales volumes (MMcfe)\n</td> <td>887,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>758,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average realized price ($/Mcfe)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nBusiness segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company's consolidated results based on operating income. Other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters' costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters' annual operating budget. Unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation and administrative costs. In 2017, unallocated expenses also included the Rice Merger acquisition related expenses of $237.3 million, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement as well as investment banking, legal and other professional fees. In 2016, unallocated expenses also included an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016.\nThe Company has reported the components of each segment's operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQT's management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQT's business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to the Rice Merger, the Company reported its results of operations through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission. These reporting segments reflected the Company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the Company evaluated its operating performance through September 30, 2017. Following the Rice Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure to incorporate the newly acquired assets. The Company now conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering (formerly known as EQT Gathering), EQM Transmission (formerly known as EQT Transmission), RMP Gathering and RMP Water. The EQT Production segment includes the Company's production activities, including those acquired in the Rice Merger, the Company's marketing operations and certain gathering operations primarily supporting the Company's production activities, including the Rice retained gathering assets. The EQM Gathering segment and the EQM Transmission segment include all of the Company's assets and operations that are owned by EQM; therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the same as EQM's disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The RMP Gathering segment contains the Company's gathering assets that are owned by RMP. The RMP Water segment contains the Company's water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities owned by RMP. Following the Rice Merger, the financial and operational disclosures related to RMP Gathering and RMP Water will be the same as RMP's successor disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEQT Production\nResults of Operations Table 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

capital expenditures of $819.0 million, non-cash capital expenditures of $10.0 million and measurement period adjustments of $(14.3) million for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017. Includes cash capital expenditures of $1,051.2 million and non-cash capital expenditures of $87.6 million related to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these transactions. \n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2017, the operating income for EQT Production includes the results of operations for the production operations and retained midstream operations acquired in the Rice Merger for the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017. See Note 2 for a discussion of the Rice Merger. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nEQT Production's operating income totaled $589.7 million for 2017 compared to operating loss of $719.7 million for 2016. The $1,309.4 million increase was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to losses on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016, higher average realized price and increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs, partly offset by increased operating expenses. These variances include the impact of the operations of Rice for the period subsequent to the Rice Merger, which added approximately $165.6 million of operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $114.6 million in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nTotal operating revenues were $3,106.3 million for 2017 compared to $1,387.1 million for 2016. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs increased as a result of a higher average realized price and a 17% increase in production sales volumes in 2017. EQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. Changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of recent acquisition activity, including the Rice Merger, as well as increased production from the 2015 and 2016 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells in 2017.\nThe $0.57 per Mcfe increase in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the increase in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.29 per Mcf, an increase in the average natural gas differential of $0.19 per Mcf and an increase in liquids prices. The improvement in the average differential primarily related to more favorable basis partly offset by unfavorable cash settled basis swaps. During 2017, basis improved in the Appalachian Basin and at sales points reached through the Company's transportation portfolio, particularly in the United States Northeast. In addition, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The $24.0 million increase in these revenues primarily related to increased gathering revenues for services provided to third parties on gathering lines acquired from Rice in addition to costs, net of recoveries, for the Company's Rockies Express Pipeline capacity in 2016.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $390.0 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to increases in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps due to decreased NYMEX prices, partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of its basis swaps due to increased basis prices.\nGathering expense increased due to increased affiliate and third party gathering capacity. The Rice Merger increased affiliate gathering expense as a result of volumes gathered by RMP Gathering which added approximately $21.0 million of expense for the post-Rice Merger period. In addition, EQT Production increased firm gathering capacity on the affiliate gathering systems owned by EQM Gathering in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. The Company's 2016 and 2017 acquisitions, excluding Rice, added third party gathering capacity and expense. Transmission expense increased due to increased third party capacity and increased firm contracts with affiliates incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin. During the fourth quarter of 2016, EQM's Ohio Valley Connector (OVC) was placed into service and as a result, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity. Additionally, the Company's firm capacity on Rockies Express pipeline increased in the first quarter of 2017. Firm capacity acquired in connection with the Rice Merger also increased transmission expenses by approximately $24.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity. Processing expense increased 44% as a result of increased processing capacity acquired through recent acquisitions and higher volumes processed, which is consistent with higher ethane and NGLs sales volumes of approximately 50% during 2017.\nThe increase in LOE was primarily due to higher salt water disposal costs. Production taxes increased as a result of higher market prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 in combination with an increase in the number of wells drilled in Pennsylvania and an increase in production volumes from recent acquisitions.\nExploration expense increased primarily due to expenses related to an exploratory well in a non-core operating area classified as a dry hole in 2017.\nSG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower pension expense of $9.4 million related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees in the second quarter of 2016, lower legal reserves in 2017, a reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and the absence of costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations in 2016. This was partly offset by higher costs associated with recent acquisitions.\nDD&A expense increased on higher production depletion as a result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2017. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Rice Merger in 2017.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2016 impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The Company did not identify any such leases in 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nEQT Production's operating loss totaled $719.7 million for 2016 compared to operating income of $132.0 million for 2015. The $851.7 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2016 compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015, a lower average realized price, increased operating expenses and decreased pipeline and net marketing services partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs.\nTotal operating revenues were $1,387.1 million for 2016 compared to $2,131.7 million for 2015. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes in 2016. EQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells.\nThe $0.62 per Mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.53 per Mcf and a decrease in the average\nnatural gas differential of $0.12 per Mcf. The decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps. While Appalachian Basin basis improved slightly for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, basis in the United States Northeast was significantly lower, particularly in the\nfirst quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions. Additionally, the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year. The Company started flowing EQT Production's produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the Company's Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to an $385.8 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps, partly offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of its basis swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2016, forward NYMEX prices increased while basis prices decreased.\nOperating expenses totaled $2,114.8 million for 2016 compared to $1,999.7 million for 2015. The increase in operating\nexpenses primarily resulted from increases in DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing, partly offset by reductions in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and exploration expense. Gathering expense increased due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and due to increased third party volumetric charges. Transmission expense increased as a result of higher third party costs incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin and increased affiliate firm capacity charges. Processing expenses increased due to higher production volumes.\nThe decrease in LOE was primarily due to lower salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the Marcellus Shale and certain operational cost savings in the Huron operations, partly offset by costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations. Production taxes were essentially flat as a higher Pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax settlement were offset by lower unhedged sales prices, a favorable property tax settlement and the expiration of the West Virginia volume based tax in 2016. The state of West Virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per Mcf additional volume based severance tax that was terminated on July 1, 2016.\nExploration expense was lower primarily due to a decrease in lease expirations related to acreage that the Company does not intend to drill prior to expiration and expenses related to exploratory wells in 2015. SG&A expense increased due to higher litigation costs, a $9.4 million charge related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees incurred in 2016, an increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and non-recurring costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations and acquisition related expenses in 2016. These increases were partly offset by drilling program reduction charges in the Permian and Huron Basins in 2015, decreased personnel costs, decreased professional service costs and charges to write off expired right of ways options in 2015. The increase in depletion expense within DD&A expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2016. Depreciation expense within DD&A increased as a result of additional assets in service.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 impairment charge primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the Permian Basin of Texas and impairments of proved properties in the Utica Shale of Ohio, as well as unproved property impairments and impairment of field level NGLs processing equipment that was not being used. The proved properties impairments in 2015 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development. The 2016 and 2015 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus near-term development activities in the Company's Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica acreage.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQM

development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of third parties and affiliates contracting for additional firm gathering capacity, which increased firm gathering capacity by approximately 475 MMcf per day following the completion of the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects. The decrease in usage fees under firm contracts was due to lower affiliate volumes in excess of firm contracted capacity. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to the additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily as a result of higher personnel costs and increased property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects partly offset by increased miscellaneous administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.4 million due to additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nGathering revenues increased by $62.4 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered in\n2016 compared to 2015, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately 300 MMcf per day following the completion of the Northern West Virginia gathering system (NWV Gathering) and Jupiter gathering system (Jupiter) expansion projects in the\nfourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

</tr>\n</table>\n (a) Includes commodity charges and fees on all volumes transported under firm contracts as well as transmission fees on volumes in excess of firm contracted capacity. \n (b) Includes volumes transported under interruptible contracts and volumes transported in excess of firm contracted capacity. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nTotal operating revenues increased by $41.4 million. Firm reservation fee revenues increased due to affiliates and third parties contracting for additional firm capacity, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. The firm capacity on the OVC resulted in lower affiliate usage fees under firm contracts. The increase in usage fees under interruptible contracts includes increased storage and parking revenue, which does not have pipeline throughput associated with it, partly offset by reduced throughput on interruptible contracts.\nOperating expenses increased by $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily due to property taxes on the OVC and higher personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of the OVC project placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense of $10.5 million related to the revaluation of differences between the regulatory and tax bases in EQM's regulated property, plant and equipment. The related regulatory liability will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the underlying property which is 43 years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues increased by $40.3 million. Firm reservation revenues increased due to affiliates contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in 2016. Higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased as a result of higher third party volumes transported or stored on an interruptible basis.\nOperating expenses increased by $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted primarily from higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of higher depreciation on the increased investment in transmission infrastructure, including those associated with the OVC and the AVC facilities.\nRMP Gathering\nResults of Operations\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

During the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, operating expenses are composed of customary expenses for a gathering business.\nRMP Water\nResults of Operations\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n2017 - 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n2016 - 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FINANCIAL DATA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands, other than per day amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operation and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATIONAL DATA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services volumes (in MMgal):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) This table sets forth selected financial and operational data for RMP Water for the period November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, as the Company acquired RMP Water on November 13, 2017 as part of the Rice Merger.\nRMP Water provides fresh water for well completions operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and collects and recycles or disposes of flowback and produced water. The majority of RMP Water's services are provided to EQT Production. RMP Water offers its services on a volumetric basis, supported by an acreage dedication from EQT Production for certain drilling areas. RMP Water charges customers a fee per gallon of water; this fee is tiered and thus is lower on a per gallon basis once the customer meets certain volumetric thresholds. During the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, operating expenses are composed of customary expenses for a water business.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $22.2 million, $9.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP project.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded AFUDC of $5.1 million, $19.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The changes in AFUDC were mainly attributable to the timing of spending on the OVC project.\nThe Company initiated its investments in trading securities in 2016 to enhance returns on a portion of its significant cash balance at that time.Trading securities consist of liquid debt securities that are carried at fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded realized losses of $2.6 million and unrealized gains of $1.5 million, respectively, on these debt securities. As of March 31, 2017, the Company closed its positions on all trading securities.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded loss on debt extinguishment of $12.6 million in connection with the early extinguishment on November 3, 2017 of the $200 million aggregate principal amount 5.15% Senior Notes due 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount 6.50% Senior Notes due 2018. The loss consists of $12.2 million paid in excess of par in order to extinguish the debt prior to maturity and $0.4 million in non-cash expenses related to the write-off of unamortized financing costs and discounts.\nInterest Expense\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $54.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by $23.6 million of interest incurred on Senior Notes issued in October 2017, $17.4 million of interest incurred on EQM's Senior Notes issued in November 2016, $8.0 million of expense related to the bridge financing commitment for the Rice Merger and $6.0 million of interest incurred on credit facility borrowings partly offset by a $7.0 million decrease due to the early extinguishment of EQT Senior Notes.\nInterest expense increased $1.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Decreased capitalized interest of $13.3 million and additional interest expense of approximately $3.3 million related to EQM's $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes issued during the fourth quarter of 2016 were mostly offset by higher interest income earned on short-term investments of $6.7 million, lower interest expense resulting from the Company's repayment of $160.0 million of debt that matured in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower\nEQM revolver fees.\nThe weighted average annual interest rates on the weighted average principal outstanding of the Company's Senior Notes, excluding EQM's Senior Notes, were 5.6%, 6.5%, and 6.5% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average annual interest rates on EQM's Senior Notes were 4.1% for 2017 and 4.0% for each of 2016 and 2015.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the borrowings and weighted average interest rates for EQT's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,115,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(263,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% beginning January 1, 2018. As a result of the change in the corporate tax rate, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue its existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower rate.\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDCs) in the year incurred. IDCs, however, have historically been limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and this has resulted in the Company paying AMT even when generating or utilizing a net operating loss carryforward (NOL) to offset regular taxable income.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation also repealed the AMT for tax years beginning January 1, 2018 and provides that existing AMT credit carryforwards can be utilized to offset current federal tax liability in tax years 2018 through 2020. In addition, 50% of any unused AMT credit carryforwards can be refunded during these years with any remaining AMT credit carryforward being fully refunded in 2021. The Company had approximately $435 million of AMT credit carryforward as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation preserved deductibility of IDCs, and provides for 100% bonus depreciation on some tangible property expenditures through 2022.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, but has recorded provisional amounts for the revaluing of net deferred tax liabilities as well as the state income tax effects related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax amounts will be recovered in future periods under this legislation. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation and refining calculations, which could potentially impact the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAll of EQGP's, RMP's and Strike Force Midstream's income is included in the Company's pre-tax income (loss). However, the Company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of EQGP's and RMP's income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of EQGP, EQM, and RMP or to the minority owner of Strike Force Midstream, which reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income and increases the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax loss.\nFor 2017 and 2016, the Company generated a federal taxable loss and the Company paid AMT in 2016. The federal and AMT NOLs generated by the taxable losses for 2017 and 2016 will be carried back to 2015 and 2014 to generate a tax refund from 2015 and an increase in AMT credit carryforwards for those years. The Company paid federal income tax in 2015 as a result of tax gains related to EQGP's IPO and the sale of NWV Gathering to EQM during that year.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's income tax (benefit) expense, including a reconciliation between income tax expense calculated at the current federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate reflected in the Company's financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of higher net income at EQM and noncontrolling interests in RMP and Strike Force Midstream as a result of the Rice Merger. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of increased net income at EQM, increased ownership of EQM common units by third parties and EQGP's IPO in 2015.\nOutlook\nThe Company's board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the Company's sum-of-the-parts discount. The board will announce a decision by the end of March, 2018, after considering the committee's recommendation.\nThe Company is committed to profitably and safely developing its Appalachian Basin natural gas and NGL reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling. The Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's substantial resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including its commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. The Company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area.\nThe Company monitors current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly. While the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the Company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into the highest value development opportunities. Upon the closing of the Rice Merger, the Company's consolidation goals were largely met and the Company plans to focus on integrating the Rice assets and realizing higher returns through longer laterals and achieving an even lower operating cost structure. The Company will also continue to pursue tactical acquisitions of fill-in acreage to extend laterals and has announced its intention to sell the Rice retained midstream assets to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions.\nEQT Production expects to spend approximately $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) in 2018, which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195 gross wells, including 134 Marcellus wells, 16 Upper Devonian wells and 45 Ohio Utica wells. The Company also intends to spend approximately $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. Estimated sales volumes are expected to be 1,520 - 1,560 Bcfe for 2018.\nThe 2018 drilling program is expected to support a 15% increase in production sales volume in 2019 over our 2018 expected sales volumes with total NGLs volumes expected to be 12,300 - 12,600 Mbbls. To support continued growth in production, the Company plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure through EQM in 2018, including capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $1.1 billion. RMP investments in organic projects are expected to total approximately $260 million in 2018, including $215 million for gathering and compression and $45 million for water infrastructure.\nThe 2018 capital investment plan for EQT Production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and cash on hand. EQM's available sources of liquidity include cash on hand and generated from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership interests. RMP's 2018 capital investment plan is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility.\nThe Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves of, natural gas and NGLs. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the Company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including Appalachian and other market point basis, and NGLs and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations.\nThe Company's 2018 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 59% higher than its 2017 well development spending. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices could affect, among other things, the Company's development plans, which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the Company's reserves, as well as the Company's revenues, earnings or liquidity. Lower prices could also result in non-cash impairments in the book value of the Company's oil and gas\nproperties, goodwill or other long lived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the Company's estimated proved reserves. Any such impairment and/or downward adjustment to the Company's estimated reserves could potentially be material to the Company.\nImpairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the Company's oil and gas properties. Due to declines in the five-year NYMEX forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016, the Company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the Company's proved oil and gas properties in those years. No indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2017. Although the Company did not have indicators of impairment or record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2017, all other things being equal, a further decline in the average five-year NYMEX forward strip price in a future period may cause the Company to recognize impairments on non-core assets, including the Company's assets in the Huron play, which had a carrying value of approximately $3 billion at December 31, 2017.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to evaluating the Company's goodwill for impairment. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2017 and determined there was no indicator of impairment. We use a combination of the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate, different estimates and assumptions could materially impact the calculated fair value of the reporting units. Additionally, future results could differ from our current estimates and assumptions. Any potential change in such estimates and assumptions would have an impact on the results of operations and financial position. Due to the uncertainty inherent in, and the interdependence of, the assumptions of underlying assets and goodwill impairment determinations, the Company cannot predict if future impairment charges will be recognized and, if so, an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period.\nSee Natural gas, NGLs and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our non-core assets. Future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, adverse changes in well performance or impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\u201d under Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's primary sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), borrowings on credit facilities and cash flows from operating activities, while the primary uses of cash were for redemptions and repayments of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, capital expenditures, the cash portion of the Merger Consideration for the Rice Merger, and redemptions of Company Senior Notes.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities increased $573.4 million from full year 2016 to full year 2017. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" and \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" sections herein and the timing of payments between the two periods, partly offset by lower cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $152.6 million from full year 2015 to full year 2016. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a lower commodity price and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher production sales volumes, cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, decreases in cash paid for income taxes and the timing of payments between periods.\nThe Company's cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities. The Company is unable to predict these future price movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. Refer to \"Natural gas, NGLs and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position.\" under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for further information.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $4,127.1 million for 2017 as compared to $2,961.5 million for 2016. The $1,165.6 million increase was primarily due to investment in the Rice Merger, an increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions spending, and higher capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions, cash received from the sale of trading securities and lower EQM capital expenditures.\nOn November 13, 2017, in conjunction with the Rice Merger, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Rice (the Rice Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive 0.37 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company (Company Common Stock) and $5.30 in cash (collectively, the Merger Consideration). The aggregate Merger Consideration consisted of approximately 91 million shares of Company Common Stock and approximately $1.6 billion in cash (net of cash acquired and inclusive of amounts payable to employees of Rice who did not continue with the Company following the Effective Time). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Rice Merger.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,961.5 million for 2016 as compared to $2,525.6 million for 2015. The $435.9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of $1,051.2 million and investments in trading securities of $288.8 million, partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures. During 2016, the Company invested in trading securities, which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value, to maximize returns. The Company also placed $75.0 million of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential like-kind exchange for tax purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\n(in millions)\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well development (primarily drilling and completion)\n</td> <td>1,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property acquisitions\n</td> <td>1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Production infrastructure\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQM Gathering\n</td> <td>197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EQM Transmission\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RMP Gathering\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RMP Water\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other corporate items\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: non-cash *\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total cash capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Represents the net impact of non-cash capital expenditures including capitalized non-cash stock-based compensation expense and accruals. The impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate, both of which are non-cash items. The year ended December 31, 2017 included $10.0 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2017 acquisitions and $(14.3) million of measurement period adjustments for 2016 acquisitions. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $87.6 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2016 acquisitions.\nThe Company has forecast a 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $2.4 billion for EQT Production, which includes $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) and $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. The Company has also forecast an EQM 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure including capital contributions to MVP and an RMP 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $260 million for gathering infrastructure and water infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $1,385 million and $783 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company spud 201 gross wells in 2017, including 144 horizontal Marcellus wells, 49 horizontal Upper Devonian wells, seven horizontal Ohio Utica wells and one other well. The Company spud 135 gross wells in 2016, including 117 horizontal Marcellus wells, 13 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 horizontal Utica wells. The increase in capital expenditures for well development in 2017 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years and an increase in\nwells spud. Capital expenditures for 2017 also included $1,007 million for property acquisitions, compared to $1,284 million of capital expenditures in 2016 for property acquisitions. These acquisitions are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $783 million and $1,670 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company spud 161 gross wells in 2015, including 133 horizontal Marcellus wells, 24 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 other wells, including 2 Utica wells. The decrease in capital expenditures for well development in 2016 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years, a decrease in wells spud, lower costs per well and operational efficiencies. Capital expenditures for 2016 also included $1,284 million for property acquisitions, compared to $182 million of capital expenditures in 2015 for property acquisitions. The Company executed multiple large transactions during 2016 that resulted in the Company's acquisition of approximately 122,100 net Marcellus acres located primarily in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for the EQM gathering and transmission operations totaled $308 million for 2017 and $587 million for 2016, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures. Expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that EQM expects to increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. This decrease in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to OVC, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCapital expenditures for the gathering, transmission and storage operations totaled $430 million for 2015, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,533.1 million for 2017 as compared to $1,399.5 million for 2016. During 2017, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and borrowings on credit facilities. The primary financing uses of cash during 2017 were redemptions and repayment of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, redemption of the Company's Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable March 1, 2018, to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQGP's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.244 per common unit, or approximately $64.9 million. The cash distribution will be paid on February 23, 2018 to unitholders of record, including the Company, at the close of business on February 2, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQM's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQM's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.025 per common unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by EQM to EQGP were approximately $65.7 million consisting of: $22.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest, $2.2 million in respect of its general partner interest and $41.1 million in respect of its IDRs in EQM.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of RMP's general partner declared a cash distribution to RMP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.2917 per common and subordinated unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including Rice Midstream GP Holdings, LP (RMGP), which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by RMP to RMGP were approximately $11.4 million, consisting of $8.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest and $3 million in respect of its IDRs in RMP.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,399.5 million for 2016 as compared to $1,832.5 million for 2015. During 2016, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock and from EQM's public offerings of common units under EQM's $750 million at-the-market (ATM) common unit offering program (the EQM $750 Million ATM Program), as well as proceeds received from the issuance of EQM Senior Notes. The primary financing uses of cash during 2016 were net credit facility repayments under the EQM credit facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards and dividends. In 2015, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were the issuance of EQM and EQGP common units and net borrowings on EQM's credit facility while the primary uses of financing cash flows were repayments of Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nEQT primarily utilizes borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until the expenditures can be permanently financed and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. Margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices, the Company's credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also borrowed under the Company's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the cash Merger Consideration and pay expenses related to the Rice Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017, certain existing letters of credit issued for the account of Rice and its subsidiaries were transferred to the Company's $2.5 billion credit facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of EQT's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurity Ratings and Financing Triggers\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2017. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Company's cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under its lines of credit. These ratings may also affect collateral requirements under derivative instruments, pipeline capacity contracts, joint venture arrangements and subsidiary construction contracts, rates available on new long-term debt and access to the credit markets.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior\nNotes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service (Moody's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Ratings Service (S&P)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Negative\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of EQM at December 31, 2017.

The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Company's or EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on the Company's derivative contracts would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances, including collateral, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin on the Company's derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating, such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated BBB- or higher by S&P, Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Company's credit facility contains financial covenants that require a\ntotal debt-to-total capitalization ratio no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nEQM's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Under EQM's $1 billion credit facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of December 31, 2017, EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nThe RMP credit facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreement, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the RMP credit facility relate to maintenance of certain financial ratios, as described below, limitations on certain investments and acquisitions, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The RMP credit facility requires RMP to maintain the following financial ratios:\n\u2022an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.50 to 1.0;\n\u2022a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.0, and after electing to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 5.25 to 1.0 (with certain increases for measurement periods following the completion of certain acquisitions); and\n\u2022if RMP elects to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2017, RMP and RMP OpCo were in compliance with all credit facility provisions and covenants.\nEQM ATM Program\nDuring 2015, EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the EQM $750 million ATM Program. EQM had approximately $443 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nRMP ATM Program\nDuring 2016, RMP entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the RMP $100 million ATM equity distribution program. RMP had approximately $83.7 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nCommodity Risk Management\nThe substantial majority of the Company's commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the Company's produced natural gas. The Company's overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily NYMEX swaps, collars and options.\nAs of January 31, 2018, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company's derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 (a)(b)(c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NYMEX Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX) (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Puts (Long)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Volume (Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX)*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Full year 2018\n (b) The Company also sold calendar year 2018 and 2019 calls for approximately 64 Bcf and 45 Bcf, respectively, at strike prices of $3.49 per Mcf and $3.69 per Mcf, respectively.  (c) For 2018, the Company also sold puts for approximately 3 Bcf at a strike price of $2.63 per Mcf.\n (d) The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf. \nThe Company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery. The difference between these sales prices and NYMEX are included in average differential on the Company's price reconciliation under \"Consolidated Operational Data\". The Company has fixed price physical sales for 2018 and 2019 of 121 Bcf and 37 Bcf, respectively, at average NYMEX prices of $2.93 per Mcf and $3.04 per Mcf, respectively. For 2018, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.88 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 49 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $3.36 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company also has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX floor price of $2.16 per Mcf and a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.47 per Mcf. Currently, the Company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its NGLs exposure. The Company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy.\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's hedging program.\nOther Items\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy-efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately $95 million as of December 31, 2017, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 11 years.\nAs of December 31, 2017, EQM had issued a $91 million performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP.\nThe NORESCO guarantees and the MVP Guarantee are exempt from ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees.\nRate Regulation\nAs described under Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business,\u201d the Company's transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. See Our need to comply with comprehensive, complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.\u201d in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for potential risks related to the regulation of rates by the FERC.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe table below presents the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 in total and by periods. Purchase obligations exclude the Company's contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with EQM, for which future payments related to such agreements totaled $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. These capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years.

Purchase obligations also include commitments with third parties for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. \n (b) Interest payments exclude interest related to the credit facility borrowings and the Floating Rate Notes (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as the interest rates on the Company's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities and the Floating Rate Notes are variable. \n (c) Credit facility borrowings were classified based on the termination dates of the Company's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities. \n (d) Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Company's drilling program. The obligations for the Company's various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $139.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company has agreements with several drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company over the next four years. These obligations totaled approximately $92.3 million as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had eight horizontal drilling rigs under contract, and an additional horizontal rig will become active on April 1, 2018. All of these will expire in 2019 with dates in this order: June 30, July 31, August 31 (2), September 30, October 31, November 30 and December 31 (2). The Company also had seven tophole drilling rigs under contract, six of which expire in 2018 and one that expires in 2019. Of the six tophole rigs that expire in 2018, the dates are in this order: January 3, February 3, February 25, June 2, August 27 and December 22. The expiration date for the tophole rig in 2019 is March 29. These drilling obligations have been included in the table above. The values in the table represent the gross amounts that the Company is committed to pay as operator. However, the Company will record in the Consolidated Financial Statements the Company's proportionate share of the amounts shown based on its working interest.  (e) See Note 20 for additional information.\n (f) The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2017 EQT Value Driver Award Program, 2017 Incentive PSU Program, 2017 restricted stock unit liability awards, 2016 EQT Value Driver Award Program and 2016 restricted stock unit liability awards. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. \nAs discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 of $301.6 million, of which $84.1 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe Company's recently issued accounting standards are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.\nThe carrying values of the Company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a field-by-field basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves, utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the Company's management for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil, adjusted accordingly for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation, some of which are interdependent. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.\nCapitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and NGLs, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and NGLs recorded and the timing of those recoveries. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Company's engineers and audited by the Company's independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, operating costs, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the Company's financial statements.\nThe Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period, which is subject to change in subsequent periods. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates, production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above for additional information regarding the Company's oil and gas reserves.\nIncome Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state NOL carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, other federal tax credit carryforwards, incentive compensation and investment in partnerships. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state NOL carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in Note 11 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the Company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. In making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Company's or counterparty's credit rating and the yield of a risk-free instrument, and\ncredit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, or market conditions or other factors change, many of which are beyond the Company's control.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company's financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the Company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, both NYMEX and basis. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nContingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results.\nThe Company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Company's plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud. The Company operates and maintains its gathering systems and transmission and storage system and it intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. The Company is under no legal or contractual obligation to restore or dismantle its gathering systems and transmission and storage system upon abandonment. Therefore, the Company does not have any asset retirement obligations related to its gathering systems and transmission and storage system as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nShare-Based Compensation: The Company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plans. Awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted units and stock options. Awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.\nRestricted units and performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards. For liability awards, the Company is required to estimate, on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the Company's common stock on, the vesting date. The Company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. The Company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.\nPerformance-based awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are treated as equity awards. For equity awards, the Company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. Determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Most often, the Company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.\nFor time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, historically three years. For director phantom units (which vest on the date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the year of grant. The grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.\nFor non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically three years. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are critical accounting estimates\u201d because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Company's common stock. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's share-based compensation.\nBusiness Combinations: Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value.\nThe most significant assumptions in a business combination include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. The fair value of proved natural gas properties is determined using a risk-adjusted after-tax discounted cash flow analysis based upon significant assumptions including commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; timing and amount of future development and operating costs; projected reserve recovery factors; and a weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company utilizes the guideline transaction method to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination which requires the Company to use judgment in considering the value per undeveloped acre in recent comparable transactions to estimate the value of unproved properties.\nThe estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, generally consisting of pipeline systems and compression stations, is estimated using the cost approach, which incorporates assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence.\nThe fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using the multi-period excess earnings model which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the intangible asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized. The Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.\nThe Rice Merger resulted in share-based compensation modification accounting which is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grant-date fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award. The calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new (modified) award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original option measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must, in determining the fair value of assets acquired, make assumptions about future commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs; and projections of reserve recovery factors, per acre values of undeveloped property, replacement cost of and future cash flows from midstream assets, cash flow from customer relationships and non-compete agreements and the pre and post modification value of stock based awards. Different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets which would impact the Company's financial position and future results of operations.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company may first consider qualitative factors to assess whether there are indicators that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may not exceed its carrying amount. To the extent that such indicators exist, a two-step goodwill impairment test is completed. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nthe second step is required which compares the implied fair value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to goodwill are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate; however, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the calculated fair value and the resulting determinations about goodwill impairment which could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, future estimates may differ materially from current estimates and assumptions.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n2017 EQT Highlights:\n \u2022 Closed the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017 \n \u2022 Achieved annual production sales volumes of 887.5 Bcfe, 17% higher than 2016 \n \u2022 Completed the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) totaling $3.0 billion \n \u2022 Received FERC Certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline \nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation for 2017 was $1,508.5 million, $8.04 per diluted share, compared with a loss attributable to EQT Corporation of $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, in 2016. The $1,961.5 million increase in net income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recorded as a result of the lower federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018, the result of a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 compared to a loss in 2016, a 23% increase in the average realized price, a 17% increase in production sales volumes, and higher pipeline, water and net marketing services, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher interest expense, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a loss on debt extinguishment in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded acquisition expenses of approximately $237.3 million related to the Rice Merger, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement. Additional expenses were for investment banking, legal and other professional fees. Acquisition costs are reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nEQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues.\nNet loss attributable to EQT Corporation for 2016 was $453.0 million, a loss of $2.71 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to EQT Corporation of $85.2 million, $0.56 per diluted share, in 2015. The $538.2 million decrease in income attributable to EQT Corporation was primarily attributable to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, a 20% decrease in the average realized price, higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes and lower income tax expense.\nEQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP\noperating revenues.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016. The impairment was a result of a reduction in estimated future cash flows caused by the low commodity price environment and the related reduced producer drilling activity and throughput. This impairment is reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment.\nSee Business Segment Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of items impacting operating income, Other Income Statement Items\u201d for a discussion of other income, interest expense, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and Investing Activities\u201d under the caption Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for a discussion of capital expenditures.\nConsolidated Operational Data\nThe following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the Company's consolidated operations, including the calculation of the Company's average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Production total operating revenues. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of EQT Production\nadjusted operating revenues to EQT Production total operating revenues and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues.\n\n(a) The Company's volume weighted NYMEX natural gas price (actual average NYMEX natural gas price ($/MMBtu) was $3.11, $2.46 and $2.66 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively).\n(b) Basis represents the difference between the ultimate sales price for natural gas and the NYMEX natural gas price.\n(c) NGLs, ethane and crude oil were converted to Mcfe at the rate of six Mcfe per barrel for all periods.\n(d) Also referred to in this report as EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure.\n(e) For the year ended December 31, 2017, EQT Production includes the results of production operations acquired in the Rice Merger for the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported under EQT Production Results of Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of EQT Production operating revenues to EQT Corporation total operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQT Production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company's management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. EQT Production adjusted operating revenues also excludes \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production. \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to third parties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volumes. Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.\n\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nBusiness segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company's consolidated results based on operating income. Other income, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. Headquarters' costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters' annual operating budget. Unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation and administrative costs. In 2017, unallocated expenses also included the Rice Merger acquisition related expenses of $237.3 million, including $141.3 million of employee related expenses for payments to former Rice employees under the Merger Agreement as well as investment banking, legal and other professional fees. In 2016, unallocated expenses also included an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $59.7 million related to certain gathering assets sold to EQM in October 2016.\nThe Company has reported the components of each segment's operating income and various operational measures in the sections below, and where appropriate, has provided information describing how a measure was derived. EQT's management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, operations and trends of each of EQT's business segments without being obscured by the financial condition, operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest, income taxes and other income. In addition, management uses these measures for budget planning purposes. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to the Rice Merger, the Company reported its results of operations through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission. These reporting segments reflected the Company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the Company evaluated its operating performance through September 30, 2017. Following the Rice Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure to incorporate the newly acquired assets. The Company now conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering (formerly known as EQT Gathering), EQM Transmission (formerly known as EQT Transmission), RMP Gathering and RMP Water. The EQT Production segment includes the Company's production activities, including those acquired in the Rice Merger, the Company's marketing operations and certain gathering operations primarily supporting the Company's production activities, including the Rice retained gathering assets. The EQM Gathering segment and the EQM Transmission segment include all of the Company's assets and operations that are owned by EQM; therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the same as EQM's disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The RMP Gathering segment contains the Company's gathering assets that are owned by RMP. The RMP Water segment contains the Company's water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities owned by RMP. Following the Rice Merger, the financial and operational disclosures related to RMP Gathering and RMP Water will be the same as RMP's successor disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEQT Production\nResults of Operations \n (a) Includes Upper Devonian wells. \n (b) NGLs, ethane and crude oil were converted to Mcfe at the rate of six Mcfe per barrel for all periods. \n (c) Includes cash capital expenditures of $819.0 million, non-cash capital expenditures of $10.0 million and measurement period adjustments of $(14.3) million for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017. Includes cash capital expenditures of $1,051.2 million and non-cash capital expenditures of $87.6 million related to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these transactions. \n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2017, the operating income for EQT Production includes the results of operations for the production operations and retained midstream operations acquired in the Rice Merger for the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017. See Note 2 for a discussion of the Rice Merger. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nEQT Production's operating income totaled $589.7 million for 2017 compared to operating loss of $719.7 million for 2016. The $1,309.4 million increase was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to losses on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016, higher average realized price and increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs, partly offset by increased operating expenses. These variances include the impact of the operations of Rice for the period subsequent to the Rice Merger, which added approximately $165.6 million of operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $114.6 million in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nTotal operating revenues were $3,106.3 million for 2017 compared to $1,387.1 million for 2016. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs increased as a result of a higher average realized price and a 17% increase in production sales volumes in 2017. EQT Production received $40.7 million and $279.4 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. Changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of recent acquisition activity, including the Rice Merger, as well as increased production from the 2015 and 2016 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells in 2017.\nThe $0.57 per Mcfe increase in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the increase in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.29 per Mcf, an increase in the average natural gas differential of $0.19 per Mcf and an increase in liquids prices. The improvement in the average differential primarily related to more favorable basis partly offset by unfavorable cash settled basis swaps. During 2017, basis improved in the Appalachian Basin and at sales points reached through the Company's transportation portfolio, particularly in the United States Northeast. In addition, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The $24.0 million increase in these revenues primarily related to increased gathering revenues for services provided to third parties on gathering lines acquired from Rice in addition to costs, net of recoveries, for the Company's Rockies Express Pipeline capacity in 2016.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $390.0 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to increases in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps due to decreased NYMEX prices, partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of its basis swaps due to increased basis prices.\nGathering expense increased due to increased affiliate and third party gathering capacity. The Rice Merger increased affiliate gathering expense as a result of volumes gathered by RMP Gathering which added approximately $21.0 million of expense for the post-Rice Merger period. In addition, EQT Production increased firm gathering capacity on the affiliate gathering systems owned by EQM Gathering in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. The Company's 2016 and 2017 acquisitions, excluding Rice, added third party gathering capacity and expense. Transmission expense increased due to increased third party capacity and increased firm contracts with affiliates incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin. During the fourth quarter of 2016, EQM's Ohio Valley Connector (OVC) was placed into service and as a result, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity. Additionally, the Company's firm capacity on Rockies Express pipeline increased in the first quarter of 2017. Firm capacity acquired in connection with the Rice Merger also increased transmission expenses by approximately $24.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company started flowing its produced volumes to its Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity. Processing expense increased 44% as a result of increased processing capacity acquired through recent acquisitions and higher volumes processed, which is consistent with higher ethane and NGLs sales volumes of approximately 50% during 2017.\nThe increase in LOE was primarily due to higher salt water disposal costs. Production taxes increased as a result of higher market prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 in combination with an increase in the number of wells drilled in Pennsylvania and an increase in production volumes from recent acquisitions.\nExploration expense increased primarily due to expenses related to an exploratory well in a non-core operating area classified as a dry hole in 2017.\nSG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower pension expense of $9.4 million related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees in the second quarter of 2016, lower legal reserves in 2017, a reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and the absence of costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations in 2016. This was partly offset by higher costs associated with recent acquisitions.\nDD&A expense increased on higher production depletion as a result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2017. Amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Rice Merger in 2017.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2016 impairment charge of $6.9 million primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The Company did not identify any such leases in 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nEQT Production's operating loss totaled $719.7 million for 2016 compared to operating income of $132.0 million for 2015. The $851.7 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2016 compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015, a lower average realized price, increased operating expenses and decreased pipeline and net marketing services partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and NGLs.\nTotal operating revenues were $1,387.1 million for 2016 compared to $2,131.7 million for 2015. Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs decreased as a result of a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 26% increase in production sales volumes in 2016. EQT Production received $279.4 million and $172.1 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that are included in the average realized price but are not in GAAP operating revenues. The increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs, primarily in the Marcellus play, partially offset by the normal production decline in the Company's producing wells.\nThe $0.62 per Mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of $0.53 per Mcf and a decrease in the average\nnatural gas differential of $0.12 per Mcf. The decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps. While Appalachian Basin basis improved slightly for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, basis in the United States Northeast was significantly lower, particularly in the\nfirst quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions. Additionally, the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year. The Company started flowing EQT Production's produced volumes to its Rockies Express pipeline capacity and Texas Eastern Transmission Gulf Markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016.\nPipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the Company's produced volumes. The decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the Company's Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity.\nEQT Production total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $249.0 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to an $385.8 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2015. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to unfavorable changes in the fair market value of EQT Production's NYMEX swaps, partly offset by favorable changes in the fair market value of its basis swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2016, forward NYMEX prices increased while basis prices decreased.\nOperating expenses totaled $2,114.8 million for 2016 compared to $1,999.7 million for 2015. The increase in operating\nexpenses primarily resulted from increases in DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing, partly offset by reductions in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets and exploration expense. Gathering expense increased due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and due to increased third party volumetric charges. Transmission expense increased as a result of higher third party costs incurred to move EQT Production's natural gas out of the Appalachian Basin and increased affiliate firm capacity charges. Processing expenses increased due to higher production volumes.\nThe decrease in LOE was primarily due to lower salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the Marcellus Shale and certain operational cost savings in the Huron operations, partly offset by costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations. Production taxes were essentially flat as a higher Pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax settlement were offset by lower unhedged sales prices, a favorable property tax settlement and the expiration of the West Virginia volume based tax in 2016. The state of West Virginia previously imposed a $0.047 per Mcf additional volume based severance tax that was terminated on July 1, 2016.\nExploration expense was lower primarily due to a decrease in lease expirations related to acreage that the Company does not intend to drill prior to expiration and expenses related to exploratory wells in 2015. SG&A expense increased due to higher litigation costs, a $9.4 million charge related to the termination of the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees incurred in 2016, an increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts, and non-recurring costs related to the consolidation of the Company's Huron operations and acquisition related expenses in 2016. These increases were partly offset by drilling program reduction charges in the Permian and Huron Basins in 2015, decreased personnel costs, decreased professional service costs and charges to write off expired right of ways options in 2015. The increase in depletion expense within DD&A expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2016. Depreciation expense within DD&A increased as a result of additional assets in service.\nImpairment of long-lived assets decreased $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 impairment charge primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the Company did not intend to drill prior to expiration. The 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the Permian Basin of Texas and impairments of proved properties in the Utica Shale of Ohio, as well as unproved property impairments and impairment of field level NGLs processing equipment that was not being used. The proved properties impairments in 2015 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development. The 2016 and 2015 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus near-term development activities in the Company's Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica acreage.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, EQT Production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for $75.0 million. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company realized a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million, which is included in gain on sale / exchange of assets in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nEQM Gathering\nResults of Operations\n\n (a) Includes fees on volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. \n (b) Includes volumes gathered under interruptible contracts and volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nGathering revenues increased by $57.0 million driven by third party and affiliate production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of third parties and affiliates contracting for additional firm gathering capacity, which increased firm gathering capacity by approximately 475 MMcf per day following the completion of the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects. The decrease in usage fees under firm contracts was due to lower affiliate volumes in excess of firm contracted capacity. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to the additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily as a result of higher personnel costs and increased property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects partly offset by increased miscellaneous administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.4 million due to additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nGathering revenues increased by $62.4 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered in\n2016 compared to 2015, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM Gathering increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately 300 MMcf per day following the completion of the Northern West Virginia gathering system (NWV Gathering) and Jupiter gathering system (Jupiter) expansion projects in the\nfourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity.\nOperating expenses increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects.\nEQM Transmission\nResults of Operations\n\n (a) Includes commodity charges and fees on all volumes transported under firm contracts as well as transmission fees on volumes in excess of firm contracted capacity. \n (b) Includes volumes transported under interruptible contracts and volumes transported in excess of firm contracted capacity. \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016\nTotal operating revenues increased by $41.4 million. Firm reservation fee revenues increased due to affiliates and third parties contracting for additional firm capacity, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. The firm capacity on the OVC resulted in lower affiliate usage fees under firm contracts. The increase in usage fees under interruptible contracts includes increased storage and parking revenue, which does not have pipeline throughput associated with it, partly offset by reduced throughput on interruptible contracts.\nOperating expenses increased by $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating and maintenance expense increased primarily due to property taxes on the OVC and higher personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate allocations from the Company as a result of the Company's shift in focus during 2017 from midstream drop-down transactions to upstream asset and corporate acquisition projects. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of the OVC project placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense of $10.5 million related to the revaluation of differences between the regulatory and tax bases in EQM's regulated property, plant and equipment. The related regulatory liability will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the underlying property which is 43 years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues increased by $40.3 million. Firm reservation revenues increased due to affiliates contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, primarily on the OVC, as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in 2016. Higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased as a result of higher third party volumes transported or stored on an interruptible basis.\nOperating expenses increased by $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted primarily from higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of higher depreciation on the increased investment in transmission infrastructure, including those associated with the OVC and the AVC facilities.\nRMP Gathering\nResults of Operations\n\n(a) This table sets forth selected financial and operational data for RMP Gathering for the period November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, as the Company acquired RMP Gathering on November 13, 2017 as part of the Rice Merger.\nThe majority of RMP Gathering revenues are from contracts with EQT Production to gather gas in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania. RMP Gathering provides all services under long-term contracts that are supported in most cases by acreage dedications. RMP Gathering charges separate rates for gathering and compression services based on the actual volumes gathered and compressed. During the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, operating expenses are composed of customary expenses for a gathering business.\nRMP Water\nResults of Operations\n\n(a) This table sets forth selected financial and operational data for RMP Water for the period November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, as the Company acquired RMP Water on November 13, 2017 as part of the Rice Merger.\nRMP Water provides fresh water for well completions operations in the Marcellus and Utica Shales and collects and recycles or disposes of flowback and produced water. The majority of RMP Water's services are provided to EQT Production. RMP Water offers its services on a volumetric basis, supported by an acreage dedication from EQT Production for certain drilling areas. RMP Water charges customers a fee per gallon of water; this fee is tiered and thus is lower on a per gallon basis once the customer meets certain volumetric thresholds. During the period from November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, operating expenses are composed of customary expenses for a water business.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments of $22.2 million, $9.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP project.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded AFUDC of $5.1 million, $19.4 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The changes in AFUDC were mainly attributable to the timing of spending on the OVC project.\nThe Company initiated its investments in trading securities in 2016 to enhance returns on a portion of its significant cash balance at that time.Trading securities consist of liquid debt securities that are carried at fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company recorded realized losses of $2.6 million and unrealized gains of $1.5 million, respectively, on these debt securities. As of March 31, 2017, the Company closed its positions on all trading securities.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded loss on debt extinguishment of $12.6 million in connection with the early extinguishment on November 3, 2017 of the $200 million aggregate principal amount 5.15% Senior Notes due 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount 6.50% Senior Notes due 2018. The loss consists of $12.2 million paid in excess of par in order to extinguish the debt prior to maturity and $0.4 million in non-cash expenses related to the write-off of unamortized financing costs and discounts.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased $54.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by $23.6 million of interest incurred on Senior Notes issued in October 2017, $17.4 million of interest incurred on EQM's Senior Notes issued in November 2016, $8.0 million of expense related to the bridge financing commitment for the Rice Merger and $6.0 million of interest incurred on credit facility borrowings partly offset by a $7.0 million decrease due to the early extinguishment of EQT Senior Notes.\nInterest expense increased $1.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Decreased capitalized interest of $13.3 million and additional interest expense of approximately $3.3 million related to EQM's $500 million 4.125% Senior Notes issued during the fourth quarter of 2016 were mostly offset by higher interest income earned on short-term investments of $6.7 million, lower interest expense resulting from the Company's repayment of $160.0 million of debt that matured in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower\nEQM revolver fees.\nThe weighted average annual interest rates on the weighted average principal outstanding of the Company's Senior Notes, excluding EQM's Senior Notes, were 5.6%, 6.5%, and 6.5% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted average annual interest rates on EQM's Senior Notes were 4.1% for 2017 and 4.0% for each of 2016 and 2015.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the borrowings and weighted average interest rates for EQT's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% beginning January 1, 2018. As a result of the change in the corporate tax rate, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017 to revalue its existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower rate.\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs (IDCs) in the year incurred. IDCs, however, have historically been limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and this has resulted in the Company paying AMT even when generating or utilizing a net operating loss carryforward (NOL) to offset regular taxable income.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation also repealed the AMT for tax years beginning January 1, 2018 and provides that existing AMT credit carryforwards can be utilized to offset current federal tax liability in tax years 2018 through 2020. In addition, 50% of any unused AMT credit carryforwards can be refunded during these years with any remaining AMT credit carryforward being fully refunded in 2021. The Company had approximately $435 million of AMT credit carryforward as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation preserved deductibility of IDCs, and provides for 100% bonus depreciation on some tangible property expenditures through 2022.\nThe Tax Reform Legislation contains several other provisions, such as limiting the utilization of NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 that are carried into future years to 80% of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, which are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, but has recorded provisional amounts for the revaluing of net deferred tax liabilities as well as the state income tax effects related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The Company also considered whether existing deferred tax amounts will be recovered in future periods under this legislation. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation and refining calculations, which could potentially impact the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAll of EQGP's, RMP's and Strike Force Midstream's income is included in the Company's pre-tax income (loss). However, the Company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of EQGP's and RMP's income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of EQGP, EQM, and RMP or to the minority owner of Strike Force Midstream, which reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income and increases the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax loss.\nFor 2017 and 2016, the Company generated a federal taxable loss and the Company paid AMT in 2016. The federal and AMT NOLs generated by the taxable losses for 2017 and 2016 will be carried back to 2015 and 2014 to generate a tax refund from 2015 and an increase in AMT credit carryforwards for those years. The Company paid federal income tax in 2015 as a result of tax gains related to EQGP's IPO and the sale of NWV Gathering to EQM during that year.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's income tax (benefit) expense, including a reconciliation between income tax expense calculated at the current federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate reflected in the Company's financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nThe increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of higher net income at EQM and noncontrolling interests in RMP and Strike Force Midstream as a result of the Rice Merger. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of increased net income at EQM, increased ownership of EQM common units by third parties and EQGP's IPO in 2015.\nOutlook\nThe Company's board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the Company's sum-of-the-parts discount. The board will announce a decision by the end of March, 2018, after considering the committee's recommendation.\nThe Company is committed to profitably and safely developing its Appalachian Basin natural gas and NGL reserves through environmentally responsible, cost-effective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling. The Company believes the long-term outlook for its business is favorable due to the Company's substantial resource base, low cost structure, financial strength, risk management, including its commodity hedging strategy, and disciplined investment of capital. The Company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area.\nThe Company monitors current and expected market conditions, including the commodity price environment, and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly. While the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions, the Company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for re-deployment into the highest value development opportunities. Upon the closing of the Rice Merger, the Company's consolidation goals were largely met and the Company plans to focus on integrating the Rice assets and realizing higher returns through longer laterals and achieving an even lower operating cost structure. The Company will also continue to pursue tactical acquisitions of fill-in acreage to extend laterals and has announced its intention to sell the Rice retained midstream assets to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions.\nEQT Production expects to spend approximately $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) in 2018, which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195 gross wells, including 134 Marcellus wells, 16 Upper Devonian wells and 45 Ohio Utica wells. The Company also intends to spend approximately $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. Estimated sales volumes are expected to be 1,520 - 1,560 Bcfe for 2018.\nThe 2018 drilling program is expected to support a 15% increase in production sales volume in 2019 over our 2018 expected sales volumes with total NGLs volumes expected to be 12,300 - 12,600 Mbbls. To support continued growth in production, the Company plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure through EQM in 2018, including capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $1.1 billion. RMP investments in organic projects are expected to total approximately $260 million in 2018, including $215 million for gathering and compression and $45 million for water infrastructure.\nThe 2018 capital investment plan for EQT Production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and cash on hand. EQM's available sources of liquidity include cash on hand and generated from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership interests. RMP's 2018 capital investment plan is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility.\nThe Company's revenues, earnings, liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for, and the Company's ability to develop its reserves of, natural gas and NGLs. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the Company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, including Appalachian and other market point basis, and NGLs and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations.\nThe Company's 2018 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 59% higher than its 2017 well development spending. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices could affect, among other things, the Company's development plans, which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the Company's reserves, as well as the Company's revenues, earnings or liquidity. Lower prices could also result in non-cash impairments in the book value of the Company's oil and gas\nproperties, goodwill or other long lived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the Company's estimated proved reserves. Any such impairment and/or downward adjustment to the Company's estimated reserves could potentially be material to the Company.\nImpairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the Company's oil and gas properties. Due to declines in the five-year NYMEX forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016, the Company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the Company's proved oil and gas properties in those years. No indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2017. Although the Company did not have indicators of impairment or record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2017, all other things being equal, a further decline in the average five-year NYMEX forward strip price in a future period may cause the Company to recognize impairments on non-core assets, including the Company's assets in the Huron play, which had a carrying value of approximately $3 billion at December 31, 2017.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for a discussion of the Company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to evaluating the Company's goodwill for impairment. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2017 and determined there was no indicator of impairment. We use a combination of the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate, different estimates and assumptions could materially impact the calculated fair value of the reporting units. Additionally, future results could differ from our current estimates and assumptions. Any potential change in such estimates and assumptions would have an impact on the results of operations and financial position. Due to the uncertainty inherent in, and the interdependence of, the assumptions of underlying assets and goodwill impairment determinations, the Company cannot predict if future impairment charges will be recognized and, if so, an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period.\nSee Natural gas, NGLs and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our non-core assets. Future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs, adverse changes in well performance or impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\u201d under Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's primary sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), borrowings on credit facilities and cash flows from operating activities, while the primary uses of cash were for redemptions and repayments of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, capital expenditures, the cash portion of the Merger Consideration for the Rice Merger, and redemptions of Company Senior Notes.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities increased $573.4 million from full year 2016 to full year 2017. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" and \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" sections herein and the timing of payments between the two periods, partly offset by lower cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges.\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $152.6 million from full year 2015 to full year 2016. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a lower commodity price and higher operating expenses, partly offset by higher production sales volumes, cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges, decreases in cash paid for income taxes and the timing of payments between periods.\nThe Company's cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities. The Company is unable to predict these future price movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. Refer to \"Natural gas, NGLs and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position.\" under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for further information.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $4,127.1 million for 2017 as compared to $2,961.5 million for 2016. The $1,165.6 million increase was primarily due to investment in the Rice Merger, an increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions spending, and higher capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions, cash received from the sale of trading securities and lower EQM capital expenditures.\nOn November 13, 2017, in conjunction with the Rice Merger, each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Rice (the Rice Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive 0.37 (the Exchange Ratio) of a share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company (Company Common Stock) and $5.30 in cash (collectively, the Merger Consideration). The aggregate Merger Consideration consisted of approximately 91 million shares of Company Common Stock and approximately $1.6 billion in cash (net of cash acquired and inclusive of amounts payable to employees of Rice who did not continue with the Company following the Effective Time). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Rice Merger.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $2,961.5 million for 2016 as compared to $2,525.6 million for 2015. The $435.9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of $1,051.2 million and investments in trading securities of $288.8 million, partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures. During 2016, the Company invested in trading securities, which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value, to maximize returns. The Company also placed $75.0 million of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential like-kind exchange for tax purposes.\nCapital Expenditures\n(in millions)\n\n* Represents the net impact of non-cash capital expenditures including capitalized non-cash stock-based compensation expense and accruals. The impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate, both of which are non-cash items. The year ended December 31, 2017 included $10.0 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2017 acquisitions and $(14.3) million of measurement period adjustments for 2016 acquisitions. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $87.6 million of non-cash capital expenditures related to 2016 acquisitions.\nThe Company has forecast a 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $2.4 billion for EQT Production, which includes $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) and $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing and other items. The Company has also forecast an EQM 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $1.5 billion on midstream infrastructure including capital contributions to MVP and an RMP 2018 capital expenditure spending plan of approximately $260 million for gathering infrastructure and water infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $1,385 million and $783 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company spud 201 gross wells in 2017, including 144 horizontal Marcellus wells, 49 horizontal Upper Devonian wells, seven horizontal Ohio Utica wells and one other well. The Company spud 135 gross wells in 2016, including 117 horizontal Marcellus wells, 13 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 horizontal Utica wells. The increase in capital expenditures for well development in 2017 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years and an increase in\nwells spud. Capital expenditures for 2017 also included $1,007 million for property acquisitions, compared to $1,284 million of capital expenditures in 2016 for property acquisitions. These acquisitions are discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for drilling and development totaled $783 million and $1,670 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company spud 161 gross wells in 2015, including 133 horizontal Marcellus wells, 24 horizontal Upper Devonian wells and 4 other wells, including 2 Utica wells. The decrease in capital expenditures for well development in 2016 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years, a decrease in wells spud, lower costs per well and operational efficiencies. Capital expenditures for 2016 also included $1,284 million for property acquisitions, compared to $182 million of capital expenditures in 2015 for property acquisitions. The Company executed multiple large transactions during 2016 that resulted in the Company's acquisition of approximately 122,100 net Marcellus acres located primarily in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital expenditures for the EQM gathering and transmission operations totaled $308 million for 2017 and $587 million for 2016, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures. Expansion capital expenditures are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that EQM expects to increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term. This decrease in expansion capital expenditures primarily related to OVC, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCapital expenditures for the gathering, transmission and storage operations totaled $430 million for 2015, primarily related to expansion capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,533.1 million for 2017 as compared to $1,399.5 million for 2016. During 2017, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from the 2017 Notes Offering (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and borrowings on credit facilities. The primary financing uses of cash during 2017 were redemptions and repayment of Rice's Senior Notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the Rice Merger, redemption of the Company's Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable March 1, 2018, to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQGP's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.244 per common unit, or approximately $64.9 million. The cash distribution will be paid on February 23, 2018 to unitholders of record, including the Company, at the close of business on February 2, 2018.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of EQM's general partner declared a cash distribution to EQM's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.025 per common unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by EQM to EQGP were approximately $65.7 million consisting of: $22.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest, $2.2 million in respect of its general partner interest and $41.1 million in respect of its IDRs in EQM.\nOn January 18, 2018, the Board of Directors of RMP's general partner declared a cash distribution to RMP's unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.2917 per common and subordinated unit. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record, including Rice Midstream GP Holdings, LP (RMGP), which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, at the close of business on February 2, 2018. Cash distributions by RMP to RMGP were approximately $11.4 million, consisting of $8.4 million in respect of its limited partner interest and $3 million in respect of its IDRs in RMP.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,399.5 million for 2016 as compared to $1,832.5 million for 2015. During 2016, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock and from EQM's public offerings of common units under EQM's $750 million at-the-market (ATM) common unit offering program (the EQM $750 Million ATM Program), as well as proceeds received from the issuance of EQM Senior Notes. The primary financing uses of cash during 2016 were net credit facility repayments under the EQM credit facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, taxes related to the vesting or exercise of equity awards and dividends. In 2015, the Company's primary sources of financing cash flows were the issuance of EQM and EQGP common units and net borrowings on EQM's credit facility while the primary uses of financing cash flows were repayments of Senior Notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nThe Company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nEQT primarily utilizes borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until the expenditures can be permanently financed and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments. Margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices, the Company's credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also borrowed under the Company's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to fund a portion of the cash Merger Consideration and pay expenses related to the Rice Merger. In addition, upon the closing of the Rice Merger on November 13, 2017, certain existing letters of credit issued for the account of Rice and its subsidiaries were transferred to the Company's $2.5 billion credit facility.\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of EQT's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurity Ratings and Financing Triggers\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the Company at December 31, 2017. Changes in credit ratings may affect the Company's cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under its lines of credit. These ratings may also affect collateral requirements under derivative instruments, pipeline capacity contracts, joint venture arrangements and subsidiary construction contracts, rates available on new long-term debt and access to the credit markets.\n\nThe table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of EQM at December 31, 2017. Changes in credit ratings may affect EQM's cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under its lines of credit. These ratings may also affect collateral requirements under joint venture arrangements and subsidiary construction contracts, rates available on new long-term debt and access to the credit markets.\n\nRMP has no long-term debt and is not currently rated by Moody's, S&P, or Fitch.\nThe Company's and EQM's credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company and EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings, particularly below investment grade, the Company's or EQM's access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs and margin deposits on the Company's derivative contracts would increase, counterparties may request additional assurances, including collateral, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. The required margin on the Company's derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating, such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the Company. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated BBB- or higher by S&P, Baa3 or higher by Moody's, and BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade.\nThe Company's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The Company's credit facility contains financial covenants that require a\ntotal debt-to-total capitalization ratio no greater than 65%. The calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nEQM's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreements, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Under EQM's $1 billion credit facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of December 31, 2017, EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.\nThe RMP credit facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the agreement, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under the RMP credit facility relate to maintenance of certain financial ratios, as described below, limitations on certain investments and acquisitions, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. The RMP credit facility requires RMP to maintain the following financial ratios:\n\u2022an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.50 to 1.0;\n\u2022a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 4.75 to 1.0, and after electing to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than 5.25 to 1.0 (with certain increases for measurement periods following the completion of certain acquisitions); and\n\u2022if RMP elects to issue senior unsecured notes, a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.0.\nAs of December 31, 2017, RMP and RMP OpCo were in compliance with all credit facility provisions and covenants.\nEQM ATM Program\nDuring 2015, EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the EQM $750 million ATM Program. EQM had approximately $443 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nRMP ATM Program\nDuring 2016, RMP entered into an equity distribution agreement that established the RMP $100 million ATM equity distribution program. RMP had approximately $83.7 million in remaining capacity under the program as of February 15, 2018.\nCommodity Risk Management\nThe substantial majority of the Company's commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the Company's produced natural gas. The Company's overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the Company are primarily NYMEX swaps, collars and options.\nAs of January 31, 2018, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company's derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were:\n\n(a) Full year 2018\n (b) The Company also sold calendar year 2018 and 2019 calls for approximately 64 Bcf and 45 Bcf, respectively, at strike prices of $3.49 per Mcf and $3.69 per Mcf, respectively.  (c) For 2018, the Company also sold puts for approximately 3 Bcf at a strike price of $2.63 per Mcf.\n (d) The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf. \nThe Company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery. The difference between these sales prices and NYMEX are included in average differential on the Company's price reconciliation under \"Consolidated Operational Data\". The Company has fixed price physical sales for 2018 and 2019 of 121 Bcf and 37 Bcf, respectively, at average NYMEX prices of $2.93 per Mcf and $3.04 per Mcf, respectively. For 2018, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.88 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 49 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX ceiling price of $3.36 per Mcf. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company also has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 Bcf per year that includes a NYMEX floor price of $2.16 per Mcf and a NYMEX ceiling price of $4.47 per Mcf. Currently, the Company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its NGLs exposure. The Company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy.\nSee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's hedging program.\nOther Items\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the sale of its NORESCO domestic operations in December 2005, the Company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of NORESCO. The savings guarantees provided that once the energy-efficiency construction was completed by NORESCO, the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years. The undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately $95 million as of December 31, 2017, extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 11 years.\nAs of December 31, 2017, EQM had issued a $91 million performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP.\nThe NORESCO guarantees and the MVP Guarantee are exempt from ASC Topic 460, Guarantees. The Company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. As such, the Company has not recorded any liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these guarantees.\nRate Regulation\nAs described under Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business,\u201d the Company's transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, regulatory accounting allows the Company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process. The Company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs. See Our need to comply with comprehensive, complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.\u201d in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d for potential risks related to the regulation of rates by the FERC.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe table below presents the Company's long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 in total and by periods. Purchase obligations exclude the Company's contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with EQM, for which future payments related to such agreements totaled $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. These capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years. Purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture and purchase obligations of the MVP Joint Venture.\n\n (a) Purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various unconsolidated pipelines, including commitments from the Company to the MVP Joint Venture, some of which extend up to 20 years or longer. The Company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties. Purchase obligations also include commitments with third parties for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. \n (b) Interest payments exclude interest related to the credit facility borrowings and the Floating Rate Notes (defined in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) as the interest rates on the Company's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities and the Floating Rate Notes are variable. \n (c) Credit facility borrowings were classified based on the termination dates of the Company's, EQM's and RMP's credit facilities. \n (d) Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings, as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the Company's drilling program. The obligations for the Company's various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately $139.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company has agreements with several drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the Company over the next four years. These obligations totaled approximately $92.3 million as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had eight horizontal drilling rigs under contract, and an additional horizontal rig will become active on April 1, 2018. All of these will expire in 2019 with dates in this order: June 30, July 31, August 31 (2), September 30, October 31, November 30 and December 31 (2). The Company also had seven tophole drilling rigs under contract, six of which expire in 2018 and one that expires in 2019. Of the six tophole rigs that expire in 2018, the dates are in this order: January 3, February 3, February 25, June 2, August 27 and December 22. The expiration date for the tophole rig in 2019 is March 29. These drilling obligations have been included in the table above. The values in the table represent the gross amounts that the Company is committed to pay as operator. However, the Company will record in the Consolidated Financial Statements the Company's proportionate share of the amounts shown based on its working interest.  (e) See Note 20 for additional information.\n (f) The other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2017 EQT Value Driver Award Program, 2017 Incentive PSU Program, 2017 restricted stock unit liability awards, 2016 EQT Value Driver Award Program and 2016 restricted stock unit liability awards. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d below and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations. \nAs discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 of $301.6 million, of which $84.1 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards. The Company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. The Company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies. See also the discussion of the revolving loan agreement between EQT and EQM in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe Company's recently issued accounting standards are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations are based upon the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities: The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.\nThe carrying values of the Company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a field-by-field basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. The estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves, utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the Company's management for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil, adjusted accordingly for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation, some of which are interdependent. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value.\nCapitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis. Indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. If it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations, the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate\u201d as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and NGLs, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and NGLs recorded and the timing of those recoveries. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves: Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. Reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the Company's engineers and audited by the Company's independent engineers. Revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, operating costs, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the Company's financial statements.\nThe Company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period, which is subject to change in subsequent periods. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate\u201d because the Company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates, production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures. Future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See \"Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties and Goodwill\" above for additional information regarding the Company's oil and gas reserves.\nIncome Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state NOL carryforwards, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, other federal tax credit carryforwards, incentive compensation and investment in partnerships. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state NOL carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforward, as it is believed that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not all be realized. No other significant valuation allowances have been established, as it is believed that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in Note 11 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the Company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. In making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. To the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production. The Company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the Company's or counterparty's credit rating and the yield of a risk-free instrument, and\ncredit default swap rates where available. The values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, or market conditions or other factors change, many of which are beyond the Company's control.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company's financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the Company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices, both NYMEX and basis. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nContingencies and Asset Retirement Obligations: The Company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers many factors in making these assessments, including history and specifics of each matter. Estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results.\nThe Company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Company's plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud. The Company operates and maintains its gathering systems and transmission and storage system and it intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists, which the Company expects for the foreseeable future. The Company is under no legal or contractual obligation to restore or dismantle its gathering systems and transmission and storage system upon abandonment. Therefore, the Company does not have any asset retirement obligations related to its gathering systems and transmission and storage system as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. In addition, the Company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.\nShare-Based Compensation: The Company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plans. Awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted units and stock options. Awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.\nRestricted units and performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards. For liability awards, the Company is required to estimate, on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through, and value of the Company's common stock on, the vesting date. The Company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. The Company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.\nPerformance-based awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are treated as equity awards. For equity awards, the Company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period of the award. Determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Most often, the Company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.\nFor time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, historically three years. For director phantom units (which vest on the date of grant) expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements in the year of grant. The grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant.\nFor non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the Company's financial statements over the vesting period, typically three years. The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock at the time of grant. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are critical accounting estimates\u201d because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Company's common stock. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's share-based compensation.\nBusiness Combinations: Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value.\nThe most significant assumptions in a business combination include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. The fair value of proved natural gas properties is determined using a risk-adjusted after-tax discounted cash flow analysis based upon significant assumptions including commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; timing and amount of future development and operating costs; projected reserve recovery factors; and a weighted average cost of capital.\nThe Company utilizes the guideline transaction method to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination which requires the Company to use judgment in considering the value per undeveloped acre in recent comparable transactions to estimate the value of unproved properties.\nThe estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, generally consisting of pipeline systems and compression stations, is estimated using the cost approach, which incorporates assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence.\nThe fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using the multi-period excess earnings model which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the intangible asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized. The Company's intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and non-compete agreements.\nThe Rice Merger resulted in share-based compensation modification accounting which is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grant-date fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award. The calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new (modified) award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original option measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the Company must, in determining the fair value of assets acquired, make assumptions about future commodity prices; projections of estimated quantities of reserves; projections of future rates of production; projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs; and projections of reserve recovery factors, per acre values of undeveloped property, replacement cost of and future cash flows from midstream assets, cash flow from customer relationships and non-compete agreements and the pre and post modification value of stock based awards. Different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets which would impact the Company's financial position and future results of operations.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company may first consider qualitative factors to assess whether there are indicators that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may not exceed its carrying amount. To the extent that such indicators exist, a two-step goodwill impairment test is completed. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nthe second step is required which compares the implied fair value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to goodwill are critical accounting estimates\u201d because the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results. The fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management's estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the Company's stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate; however, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the calculated fair value and the resulting determinations about goodwill impairment which could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, future estimates may differ materially from current estimates and assumptions.", "item_7_tables": "Table 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

points from the MD&A report:\n\n- EQT had net income of $1.5 billion in 2017 compared to a net loss of $453 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a $1.2 billion tax benefit from lower corporate tax rates, gains on derivatives in 2017 vs losses in 2016, higher realized prices, and increased production volumes. \n\n- Revenues increased 124% to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by higher commodity prices, production volumes, and gains on derivatives. Operating expenses increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to higher gathering, processing, transmission, and DD&A expenses.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion in 2017 compared to $2.7 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily for well development, property acquisitions, and contributions to the Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture. \n\n- In November 2017, EQT acquired Rice Energy in a $6.7 billion transaction. This expanded EQT's acreage position in the Marcellus and Utica shales.\n\n- For 2018, EQT forecasts capital expenditures of $2.4 billion for EQT Production and $1.5 billion for its midstream business. It expects to grow production sales volumes by 15% in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\n- EQT has hedged approximately 50% of expected 2018 natural gas production with swaps at an average NYMEX price of $3.14 per Mcf. It also has fixed price physical sales agreements in place.\n\n- The report discusses critical accounting estimates related to impairments, reserves, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies, and business combinations. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on EQT's financial statements."}
