Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of AFF, which is a leading technology-driven retail POS payments platform primarily focused on providing LTO products. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the AFF Acquisition.\nWith the AFF Acquisition, the Company now operates two business lines: pawn operations and retail POS payment solutions. Its business lines are organized into three reportable segments. The U.S. pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in the U.S. and the Latin America pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and El Salvador. The retail POS payment solutions segment consists of the operations of AFF in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Financial information regarding the Company's revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas is provided in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's primary business line continues to be the operation of retail pawn stores, also known as pawnshops,\u201d which focus on serving cash and credit-constrained consumers. Pawn stores help customers meet small short-term cash needs by providing non-recourse pawn loans and buying merchandise directly from customers. Personal property, such as jewelry, electronics, tools, appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments, is pledged and held as collateral for the pawn loans over the typical 30-day term of the loan. Pawn stores also generate retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers.\nThe Company's retail POS payment solutions business line consists solely of the operations of AFF, which focuses on providing LTO and retail financing payment options across a large network of traditional and e-commerce retail merchant partners in all 50 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. AFF's retail partnerships provide consumer goods and services to their shoppers and use AFF's LTO and retail finance solutions to facilitate payments on such transactions. As one of the largest omni-channel providers of no credit required\u201d payment options, AFF's technology set provides its merchant partners with seamless leasing and financing experiences in-store, online, in-cart and on mobile devices.\nBusiness operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The following table provides exchange rates for the Mexican peso, Guatemalan quetzal and Colombian peso for the current and prior-year periods:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nOver Prior-\nYear Period\nFavorable /\n(Unfavorable) </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change\nOver Prior-\nYear Period\nFavorable /\n(Unfavorable) </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexican peso / U.S. dollar exchange rate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End-of-period </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Guatemalan quetzal / U.S. dollar exchange rate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End-of-period </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colombian peso / U.S. dollar exchange rate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>End-of-period </td> <td> </td> <td>3,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,277 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Twelve months ended </td> <td> </td> <td>3,742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,280 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars, and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, which are billed and paid in U.S. dollars. Amounts presented on a constant currency basis are denoted as such. See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional discussion of constant currency operating results.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenue and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates that could have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nPawn loans and revenue recognition - Pawn loans are secured by the customer's pledge of tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan. If a pawn loan defaults, the Company relies on the sale of the pawned property to recover the principal amount of an unpaid pawn loan, plus a yield on the investment, as the Company's pawn loans are non-recourse against the customer. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If the pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the pawn loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the principal amount loaned becomes the inventory carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value. The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount.\nPawn inventories and revenue recognition - Pawn inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawn loans and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Pawn inventories from forfeited pawn loans are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Pawn inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of pawn inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Pawn inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, valuation allowances are established if pawn inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated pawn inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\nThe Company's merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. Some jewelry inventory is melted and processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nLeased merchandise and revenue recognition - The Company provides merchandise, consisting primarily of furniture and mattresses, appliances, jewelry, electronics and automotive products, to customers of its merchant partners for lease under certain terms agreed to by the customer. The customer has the right to acquire the title either through an early buyout option or through payment of all required lease payments. The Company maintains ownership of the leased merchandise until all payment obligations are satisfied under the lease agreement. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time by returning the merchandise and making all scheduled payments due through the minimum lease holding period, which is typically 60 days. Leased merchandise contracts can typically be renewed for between six to 24 months. Leased merchandise is stated at depreciated cost. The Company depreciates leased merchandise over the life of the lease, and assumes no salvage value. Depreciation is accelerated upon an early buyout. All of the Company's leased merchandise represents on-lease merchandise and all leases are operating leases.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease income is recognized over the lease term and is recorded net of any sales taxes collected. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. Initial direct costs related to the Company\u02bcs lease agreements are added to the basis of the leased property and recognized over the lease term in proportion to the recognition of lease income. The Company typically charges the customer a non-refundable processing fee at lease inception and may also receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for leases originated at their locations, which are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method as adjustments to lease income over the contractual life of the related leased merchandise. Unamortized fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early buyout or charge-off.\nThe Company accrues for lease income earned but not yet collected as accrued rent receivable, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Alternatively, lease payments received in excess of the amount earned are recognized as deferred revenue, which is included in customer deposits and prepayments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Customer payments are first applied to applicable sales tax and scheduled lease payments, then applied to any uncollected fees, such as late fees and insufficient fund fees. The Company collects sales taxes on behalf of the customer and remits all applicable sales taxes collected to the respective jurisdiction.\nProvision for lease losses - The Company records a provision for lease losses on an allowance method, which estimates the leased merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period. The allowance for lease losses is based primarily upon historical loss experience with consideration given to recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices.\nThe Company charges off leased merchandise when a lease is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the leased merchandise at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nFinance receivables and revenue recognition - The Company purchases and services retail finance receivables, the term of which typically range from six to 24 months, directly from its merchant partners or from its bank partner. The Company has a partnership with a Utah state-chartered bank that requires the Company to purchase the rights to the cash flows associated with finance receivables marketed to retail consumers on the bank's behalf. The bank establishes the underwriting criteria for the finance receivables originated by the bank.\nInterest income is recognized using the interest method over the life of the finance receivable for all loans for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical loan redemption statistics and stops accruing interest upon charge-off. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. The Company receives an origination fee on newly purchased bank loans and may receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for finance receivables purchased from them, which are deferred and amortized using the interest method as adjustments to yield over the contractual life of the related finance receivable. Unamortized origination fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early payoff or charge-off.\nThe Company offers customers an early payoff discount on most of its finance receivables whereby the customer has between 90 and 105 days to pay the full principal balance without incurring any interest charge. If the borrower does not pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period, interest charges are applied retroactively to the inception date of the loan. The Company accrues interest income during the early payoff discount period but records a reserve for loans expected to pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period based on historical payment patterns.\nProvision for loan losses - Expected lifetime losses on finance receivables are recognized upon loan purchase, which requires the Company to make its best estimate of probable lifetime losses at the time of purchase. The Company segments its finance receivable portfolio into pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics which include loan product and monthly origination vintage and evaluates each pool for impairment.\nThe Company calculates the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss information and incorporates observable and forecasted economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period covering the full contractual life of finance receivables. Incorporating observable and forecasted economic conditions could have a material impact on the measurement of the allowance to the extent that forecasted economic conditions change significantly. The Company may also consider other qualitative factors to address recent and forecasted business trends in estimating the allowance, as necessary, including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to cover expected lifetime losses on the finance receivable portfolio, and the appropriateness of the allowance is evaluated at each period end.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company charges off finance receivables when a receivable is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the finance receivable at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nBusiness combinations - Business combination accounting requires the Company to determine the fair value of all assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. The total consideration of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability as of the acquisition date, and any remaining acquisition consideration is classified as goodwill. This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions. When appropriate, the Company utilizes independent valuation experts to advise and assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with a business acquisition, in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for identified intangible assets and in determining the fair value of contingent consideration, which is reviewed at each subsequent reporting period with changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. pawn, Latin America pawn and retail POS payment solutions. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors, such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the impairment testing methodology. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's other material indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names and pawn licenses. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount.

The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company's operations, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the unknown duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be impacted by variants of concern and the efficacy and adoption rate of the COVID-19 vaccines in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, changes in economic conditions and consumer spending, rising inflation, and the actions taken to limit the economic impact of COVID-19, such as government stimulus and other transfer programs, have and may continue to have a material adverse impact on demand for pawn loans in future periods. Moreover, safety protocols, staffing constraints and supply chain delays continue to impact operations and traffic counts for many retailers, which include the Company's pawn stores and many of AFF's retail merchant partners.\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for the Company's operations by reporting segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Operations\nU.S. retail merchandise sales increased 3% to $742.4 million during 2021 compared to $720.3 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales were flat during 2021 compared to 2020. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 44% during 2021 compared to a margin of 42% during 2020. The increase in margin was primarily a result of continued retail demand for value-priced pre-owned merchandise, increased buying of merchandise directly from customers and lower levels of aged inventory, which limited the need for normal discounting.\nU.S. inventories increased 45% from $136.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $197.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 1% at December 31, 2021 compared to 2% at December 31, 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2021 increased 16% in total and 13% on a same-store basis compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 to pre-pandemic levels as the economy reopened and government stimulus programs were curtailed.\nU.S. pawn loan fees decreased 2% to $305.4 million during 2021 compared to $310.4 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees decreased 4% during 2021 compared to 2020. The decline in total and same-store pawn loan fees was primarily due to the significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels, partially offset by the continued recovery in pawn loan demand towards pre-pandemic levels during 2021.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses decreased 4% to $380.9 million during 2021 compared to $396.6 million during 2020 and same-store operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in total and same-store operating expenses was primarily due to reduced staffing levels and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19, partially offset by increased store-level incentive compensation driven by increased revenues towards the latter part of 2021.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $232.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $204.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin reflected an increase in gross profit from retail sales and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a slight decrease in pawn loan fees, gross profit from scrap sales and net revenue from consumer loan and credit services products as a result of discontinuing consumer lending operations in U.S. pawn stores in 2020.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLatin America Pawn Segment\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, that are billed and paid in U.S. dollars.\nLatin American results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 were impacted by a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar. The translated value of Latin American earning assets as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was also impacted by a 4% unfavorable change in the end-of-period value of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the Latin America pawn segment as of

$54.2 million at December 31, 2020 to $65.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in Latin America were 1% at December 31, 2021 and 2% at December 31, 2020.\nLatin America retail merchandise sales increased 10% (4% on a constant currency basis) to $391.9 million during 2021 compared to $355.2 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales increased 8% (2% on a constant currency basis). The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during 2021 and 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nLatin America pawn loan receivables increased 4% (7% on a constant currency basis) as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and on a same-store basis, increased by 3% (6% on a constant currency basis). The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables and resulting pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 towards pre-pandemic levels.\nLatin America pawn loan fees increased 16% (10% on a constant currency basis), totaling $170.4 million during 2021 compared to $147.1 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees increased 14% (8% on a constant currency basis) during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in total and same-store constant currency pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued improvement of pawn loan origination activity during 2021, partially offset by significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 8% (3% on a constant currency basis) to $179.0 million during 2021 compared to $165.5 million during 2020. Same-store operating expenses increased 6% (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $121.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 21% compared to $106.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin was primarily due to an increase in gross profit from retail sales and pawn loan fees and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from scrap sales and an increase in store operating expenses.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment\nThe Company completed the AFF Acquisition on December 17, 2021 and the results of operations of AFF have been consolidated since the acquisition date.

These results are significantly impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments as noted in the retail POS payment solutions segment above.\nCorporate Expenses and Taxes\nAdministrative expenses increased less than 1% to $111.3 million during 2021 compared to $110.9 million during 2020, primarily due to increased incentive compensation and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso resulting in higher U.S. dollar translated expenses, partially offset by reduced travel costs and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 7% during 2021 and 2020.\nInterest expense increased 10% to $32.4 million during 2021 compared to $29.3 million for 2020, primarily related to the December 13, 2021 issuance of the $550.0 million senior unsecured notes due in 2030 and increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and acquisition expenses increased to $15.4 million during 2021 compared to $1.3 million during 2020, reflecting transaction costs primarily related to the AFF Acquisition in 2021.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company recognized a gain of $17.9 million during 2021 as a result of a decrease in the liability for the estimated fair value of certain contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition which is tied to the Company's stock price. The gain was due to the increase in the Company's stock price from $62.83 on December 16, 2021 to $74.81 on December 31, 2021, which decreased the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a $1.6 million and $7.1 million write-off of certain merger related lease intangibles, respectively. The lease intangibles, which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets, were recorded in conjunction with the Cash America merger and were written-off primarily as a result of the Company purchasing the store real estate from the landlords of certain existing legacy Cash America stores. During 2021, the Company also recorded a $0.7 million gain on the sale of real estate, and during 2020, the Company also recorded a $1.9 million impairment of other assets and a $1.5 million impairment of property and equipment.\nDuring 2020, the Company redeemed its outstanding $300.0 million, 5.375% senior notes due 2024, incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.7 million, which includes an early redemption premium and other redemption costs of $8.8 million and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 25.0% and 25.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased foreign permanent tax benefit recorded during 2021 related to an increased inflation index adjustment allowed in Mexico as a result of elevated inflation during 2021, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized in 2020 resulting from the Internal Revenue Service finalizing regulations for the GILTI provisions for foreign operations in the U.S. federal tax code, which essentially eliminated the impact of the incremental GILTI tax on the Company. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMaterial Capital Requirements\nThe Company's primary capital requirements include:\n\u2022Expand pawn operations through growth of pawn receivables and inventories in existing stores, new store openings and strategic acquisition of pawn stores;\n\u2022Expand retail POS payment solutions operations through growth of the business generated from new and existing merchant partners;\n\u25e6Expected to result in additional purchases of lease merchandise, funding of additional finance receivables and an increase in servicing and collection activities to support increased leases and finance receivables outstanding;\n\u25e6Expected to require operational support and development activities around AFF's proprietary loan management and decisioning systems along with merchant and customer service functions; and\n\u2022Return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nOther material capital requirements include operating expenses (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding operating lease commitments), general corporate operating activities, income tax payments and debt service among others. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities and available and unused funds under its revolving unsecured credit facilities will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months.\nExpand Pawn Operations\nThe Company intends to continue expansion through new store openings, primarily in Latin America. The impacts of COVID-19 limited the number of 2021 new store openings to 61. For 2022, the Company expects to add up to 60 de novo full-service pawn locations in Latin America. Future store openings remain subject to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, the ability to continue construction projects and obtain necessary licenses and permits, utility services, store equipment, supplies and staffing.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential pawn store acquisition opportunities and will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. The Company acquired 46 pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired a pawn license that will be used to open a new pawn store in the state of Nevada during 2022 for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments.\nAlthough viewed by management as a discretionary expenditure not required to operate its pawn stores, the Company may continue to purchase real estate from its landlords at existing stores or in conjunction with pawn store acquisitions, as opportunities arise at reasonable valuations. The Company purchased the real estate at 54 store locations, primarily from landlords at existing stores, for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million during 2021.\nExpand Retail POS Payment Solutions Operations\nAFF will continue to promote and build relationships with existing customers and merchants and believes there is an opportunity to increase the share of existing merchants' overall transaction volumes. While existing merchant partner relationships represent a significant source of AFF's origination volumes, the Company believes there are also many more untapped traditional and e-commerce merchants providing goods and services to customers that could benefit from offering AFF's retail POS payment solutions. AFF has made, and intends to continue to make, investments in its marketing team to drive awareness of AFF's products at its merchant partners to increase utilization and encourage repeat business through increased marketing directly to AFF's customers. In addition, AFF has made and intends to continue to make investments in its unique and proprietary decisioning platform.\nReturn of Capital to Shareholders\nIn February 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.30 per share first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $14.5 million based on the December 31, 2021 share count, to be paid on February 28, 2022 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2022. While the Company currently expects to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends, the amount, declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors including the impact of COVID-19.\nDuring 2021, the Company repurchased a total of 688,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $49.6 million and an average cost per share of $72.10, and during 2020, repurchased 1,427,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $107.0 million and an average cost per share of $74.96. The Company has approximately $72.2 million of remaining availability under its currently authorized stock repurchase program. While the Company intends to continue repurchases under its active share repurchase program, future share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, dividend policy, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, including acquisitions, and the impact of COVID-19.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to enter into interest rate hedge transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were $120.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $267.0 million of available and unused funds under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities, subject to certain financial covenants (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company had working capital of $737.2 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 included $57.5 million held by its foreign subsidiaries. These cash balances, which are primarily held in Mexican pesos, are associated with foreign earnings the Company has asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which the Company primarily plans to use to support its continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of the Company's foreign operations. Primarily as a result of reduced store opening and acquisition activity, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, the Company elected to repatriate $10.0 million from certain foreign subsidiaries during 2021.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe continued developments and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to predict the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company's liquidity and presents a material uncertainty, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future. Other factors, such as changes in general customer traffic and demand, pawn loan balances, loan-to-value ratios, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, LTO and finance receivable originations, collection of lease and finance receivable payments, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to merger and acquisition activities, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new pawn store expansion and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Additionally, a prolonged reduction in earnings and EBITDA could limit the Company's future ability to fully borrow on its credit facilities under current leverage covenants. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See Item 1. Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nIf needed, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, repatriation of excess cash held in Latin America, the sale of assets, reductions in operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends, the forbearance or deferral of operating expenses, the issuance of debt or equity securities, leveraging currently unencumbered real estate owned by the Company and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory, which accounts for approximately 49% of total inventory, gives the Company flexibility to quickly increase cash flow, if necessary.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Metrics\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(744,637) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,352) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(137,053) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>576,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(186,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(120,806) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>737,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>418,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538,087 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio </td> <td>2.9:1 </td> <td>3.0:1 </td> <td>3.7:1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 million from $222.3 million for 2020 to $223.3 million for 2021, due to net changes in certain non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to operating cash flow and net changes in other operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows), and an increase in net income of $18.3 million.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $724.3 million, or 3,559%, from $20.4 million during 2020 to $744.6 million during 2021. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund acquisitions, purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements, which includes capital expenditures for improvements to existing pawn stores and for new pawn store openings and other corporate assets, and discretionary purchases of store real property. In addition, cash flows related to the funding of new pawn loans, net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral, and finance receivables are included in investing activities. The portion of the AFF Acquisition consideration paid in cash, net of cash acquired, was $462.1 million while the Company also paid $81.8 million in cash related to current and prior-year pawn store acquisitions, $42.0 million for furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and $79.5 million for discretionary pawn store real property purchases during 2021 compared to $44.3 million, $37.5 million and $45.5 million in 2020, respectively. The Company funded a net increase in pawn loans of $73.3 million during 2021, whereas the Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn loans of $105.4 million during 2020, and the Company funded a net increase in finance receivables of $5.8 million during 2021.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $763.5 million, or 409%, from net cash used in financing activities of $186.5 million during 2020 to net cash provided by financing activities of $577.0 million during 2021. Net borrowings on the credit facilities were $136.0 million during 2021 compared to net payments of $215.5 million during 2020. During 2021, the Company received $550.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $10.6 million in debt issuance costs which was used primarily to fund the acquisition of AFF. During 2020, the Company received $500.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $8.0 million in debt issuance costs. Using part of the proceeds from these senior unsecured notes, the Company redeemed $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes and paid redemption premiums and other redemption costs of $8.8 million during 2020. The Company funded $49.6 million for share repurchases and paid dividends of $47.5 million during 2021, compared to funding $107.0 million of share repurchases and dividends paid of $44.8 million during 2020. In addition, the Company paid $1.7 million in withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock unit awards and stock options exercised and received $0.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2021, compared to $3.7 million and $1.1 million, during 2020, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted retail POS payment solutions segment metrics and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWhile acquisitions are an important part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods, which include the Company's transaction expenses incurred in connection with its acquisition of AFF. In addition, the Company does not consider these merger and acquisition expenses to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations and such expenses are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities, among others.\nThe Company has certain leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The lease liability of these U.S. dollar denominated leases, which is considered a monetary liability, is remeasured into Mexican pesos using current period exchange rates resulting in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses because they are non-cash, non-operating items that could create volatility in the Company's consolidated results of operations due to the magnitude of the end of period lease liability being remeasured and to improve comparability of current periods presented with prior periods.\nIn conjunction with the Cash America merger in 2016, the Company recorded certain lease intangibles related to above or below market lease liabilities of Cash America which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets. As the Company continues to opportunistically purchase real estate from landlords at certain Cash America stores, the associated lease intangible, if any, is written-off and gain or loss is recognized. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these gains or losses given the variability in size and timing of these transactions and because they are non-cash, non-operating gains or losses. The Company believes this improves comparability of operating results for current periods presented with prior periods.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted

The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and net fundings/repayments of pawn loan and finance receivables, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted for merger and acquisition expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature.\nFree cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pawn loans, net (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(73,340) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,844) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,022) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,543) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,311) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow </td> <td> </td> <td>102,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,691 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and acquisition expenses paid, net of tax benefit </td> <td> </td> <td>11,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted free cash flow </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes the funding of new loans net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral.\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nManagement believes the presentation of certain retail POS payment solutions segment metrics adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of AFF's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, which management believes is non-operating in nature and not representative of AFF's core operating performance. See the retail POS payment solutions segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain amounts adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting to as reported GAAP amounts.\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America pawn segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nEffects of Inflation\nDuring 2021, the Company does not believe inflation had a material effect on the volume of pawn loans originated by the Company or AFF's transaction volume, merchandise sales of the Company, or the Company's results of operations during 2021. Widely reported inflation has occurred, however, and may be ongoing into the foreseeable future. Depending on the severity and persistence of these inflationary pressures, the Company could see a negative impact on its customers' ability to pay (including an impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable) for its goods and services as well as increases in wages and other operating costs. However, inflationary economic environments could also benefit the Company by increasing customer demand for value priced products and lending services in its pawn stores.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations, and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of pawn service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to pawn loan balance growth. Pawn service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the typical repayment period of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. In addition, AFF customers generally exercise the early buyout option on their existing lease or finance receivable more frequently during the first quarter associated with tax refund proceeds. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds in the U.S.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of AFF, which is a leading technology-driven retail POS payments platform primarily focused on providing LTO products. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the AFF Acquisition.\nWith the AFF Acquisition, the Company now operates two business lines: pawn operations and retail POS payment solutions. Its business lines are organized into three reportable segments. The U.S. pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in the U.S. and the Latin America pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and El Salvador. The retail POS payment solutions segment consists of the operations of AFF in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Financial information regarding the Company's revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas is provided in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's primary business line continues to be the operation of retail pawn stores, also known as pawnshops,\u201d which focus on serving cash and credit-constrained consumers. Pawn stores help customers meet small short-term cash needs by providing non-recourse pawn loans and buying merchandise directly from customers. Personal property, such as jewelry, electronics, tools, appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments, is pledged and held as collateral for the pawn loans over the typical 30-day term of the loan. Pawn stores also generate retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers.\nThe Company's retail POS payment solutions business line consists solely of the operations of AFF, which focuses on providing LTO and retail financing payment options across a large network of traditional and e-commerce retail merchant partners in all 50 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. AFF's retail partnerships provide consumer goods and services to their shoppers and use AFF's LTO and retail finance solutions to facilitate payments on such transactions. As one of the largest omni-channel providers of no credit required\u201d payment options, AFF's technology set provides its merchant partners with seamless leasing and financing experiences in-store, online, in-cart and on mobile devices.\nBusiness operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.

Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars, and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, which are billed and paid in U.S. dollars. Amounts presented on a constant currency basis are denoted as such. See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional discussion of constant currency operating results.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenue and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates that could have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nPawn loans and revenue recognition - Pawn loans are secured by the customer's pledge of tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan. If a pawn loan defaults, the Company relies on the sale of the pawned property to recover the principal amount of an unpaid pawn loan, plus a yield on the investment, as the Company's pawn loans are non-recourse against the customer. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If the pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the pawn loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the principal amount loaned becomes the inventory carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value. The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount.\nPawn inventories and revenue recognition - Pawn inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawn loans and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Pawn inventories from forfeited pawn loans are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Pawn inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of pawn inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Pawn inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, valuation allowances are established if pawn inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated pawn inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\nThe Company's merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. Some jewelry inventory is melted and processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nLeased merchandise and revenue recognition - The Company provides merchandise, consisting primarily of furniture and mattresses, appliances, jewelry, electronics and automotive products, to customers of its merchant partners for lease under certain terms agreed to by the customer. The customer has the right to acquire the title either through an early buyout option or through payment of all required lease payments. The Company maintains ownership of the leased merchandise until all payment obligations are satisfied under the lease agreement. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time by returning the merchandise and making all scheduled payments due through the minimum lease holding period, which is typically 60 days. Leased merchandise contracts can typically be renewed for between six to 24 months. Leased merchandise is stated at depreciated cost. The Company depreciates leased merchandise over the life of the lease, and assumes no salvage value. Depreciation is accelerated upon an early buyout. All of the Company's leased merchandise represents on-lease merchandise and all leases are operating leases.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease income is recognized over the lease term and is recorded net of any sales taxes collected. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. Initial direct costs related to the Company\u02bcs lease agreements are added to the basis of the leased property and recognized over the lease term in proportion to the recognition of lease income. The Company typically charges the customer a non-refundable processing fee at lease inception and may also receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for leases originated at their locations, which are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method as adjustments to lease income over the contractual life of the related leased merchandise. Unamortized fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early buyout or charge-off.\nThe Company accrues for lease income earned but not yet collected as accrued rent receivable, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Alternatively, lease payments received in excess of the amount earned are recognized as deferred revenue, which is included in customer deposits and prepayments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Customer payments are first applied to applicable sales tax and scheduled lease payments, then applied to any uncollected fees, such as late fees and insufficient fund fees. The Company collects sales taxes on behalf of the customer and remits all applicable sales taxes collected to the respective jurisdiction.\nProvision for lease losses - The Company records a provision for lease losses on an allowance method, which estimates the leased merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period. The allowance for lease losses is based primarily upon historical loss experience with consideration given to recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices.\nThe Company charges off leased merchandise when a lease is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the leased merchandise at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nFinance receivables and revenue recognition - The Company purchases and services retail finance receivables, the term of which typically range from six to 24 months, directly from its merchant partners or from its bank partner. The Company has a partnership with a Utah state-chartered bank that requires the Company to purchase the rights to the cash flows associated with finance receivables marketed to retail consumers on the bank's behalf. The bank establishes the underwriting criteria for the finance receivables originated by the bank.\nInterest income is recognized using the interest method over the life of the finance receivable for all loans for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical loan redemption statistics and stops accruing interest upon charge-off. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. The Company receives an origination fee on newly purchased bank loans and may receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for finance receivables purchased from them, which are deferred and amortized using the interest method as adjustments to yield over the contractual life of the related finance receivable. Unamortized origination fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early payoff or charge-off.\nThe Company offers customers an early payoff discount on most of its finance receivables whereby the customer has between 90 and 105 days to pay the full principal balance without incurring any interest charge. If the borrower does not pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period, interest charges are applied retroactively to the inception date of the loan. The Company accrues interest income during the early payoff discount period but records a reserve for loans expected to pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period based on historical payment patterns.\nProvision for loan losses - Expected lifetime losses on finance receivables are recognized upon loan purchase, which requires the Company to make its best estimate of probable lifetime losses at the time of purchase. The Company segments its finance receivable portfolio into pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics which include loan product and monthly origination vintage and evaluates each pool for impairment.\nThe Company calculates the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss information and incorporates observable and forecasted economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period covering the full contractual life of finance receivables. Incorporating observable and forecasted economic conditions could have a material impact on the measurement of the allowance to the extent that forecasted economic conditions change significantly. The Company may also consider other qualitative factors to address recent and forecasted business trends in estimating the allowance, as necessary, including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to cover expected lifetime losses on the finance receivable portfolio, and the appropriateness of the allowance is evaluated at each period end.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company charges off finance receivables when a receivable is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the finance receivable at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nBusiness combinations - Business combination accounting requires the Company to determine the fair value of all assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. The total consideration of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability as of the acquisition date, and any remaining acquisition consideration is classified as goodwill. This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions. When appropriate, the Company utilizes independent valuation experts to advise and assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with a business acquisition, in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for identified intangible assets and in determining the fair value of contingent consideration, which is reviewed at each subsequent reporting period with changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. pawn, Latin America pawn and retail POS payment solutions. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors, such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the impairment testing methodology. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's other material indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names and pawn licenses. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount.

The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company's operations, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the unknown duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be impacted by variants of concern and the efficacy and adoption rate of the COVID-19 vaccines in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, changes in economic conditions and consumer spending, rising inflation, and the actions taken to limit the economic impact of COVID-19, such as government stimulus and other transfer programs, have and may continue to have a material adverse impact on demand for pawn loans in future periods. Moreover, safety protocols, staffing constraints and supply chain delays continue to impact operations and traffic counts for many retailers, which include the Company's pawn stores and many of AFF's retail merchant partners.\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for the Company's operations by reporting segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Operations\nU.S. retail merchandise sales increased 3% to $742.4 million during 2021 compared to $720.3 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales were flat during 2021 compared to 2020. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 44% during 2021 compared to a margin of 42% during 2020. The increase in margin was primarily a result of continued retail demand for value-priced pre-owned merchandise, increased buying of merchandise directly from customers and lower levels of aged inventory, which limited the need for normal discounting.\nU.S. inventories increased 45% from $136.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $197.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 1% at December 31, 2021 compared to 2% at December 31, 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2021 increased 16% in total and 13% on a same-store basis compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 to pre-pandemic levels as the economy reopened and government stimulus programs were curtailed.\nU.S. pawn loan fees decreased 2% to $305.4 million during 2021 compared to $310.4 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees decreased 4% during 2021 compared to 2020. The decline in total and same-store pawn loan fees was primarily due to the significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels, partially offset by the continued recovery in pawn loan demand towards pre-pandemic levels during 2021.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses decreased 4% to $380.9 million during 2021 compared to $396.6 million during 2020 and same-store operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in total and same-store operating expenses was primarily due to reduced staffing levels and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19, partially offset by increased store-level incentive compensation driven by increased revenues towards the latter part of 2021.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $232.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $204.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin reflected an increase in gross profit from retail sales and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a slight decrease in pawn loan fees, gross profit from scrap sales and net revenue from consumer loan and credit services products as a result of discontinuing consumer lending operations in U.S. pawn stores in 2020.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLatin America Pawn Segment\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, that are billed and paid in U.S. dollars.\nLatin American results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 were impacted by a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar. The translated value of Latin American earning assets as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was also impacted by a 4% unfavorable change in the end-of-period value of the Mexican peso

$54.2 million at December 31, 2020 to $65.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in Latin America were 1% at December 31, 2021 and 2% at December 31, 2020.\nLatin America retail merchandise sales increased 10% (4% on a constant currency basis) to $391.9 million during 2021 compared to $355.2 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales increased 8% (2% on a constant currency basis). The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during 2021 and 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nLatin America pawn loan receivables increased 4% (7% on a constant currency basis) as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and on a same-store basis, increased by 3% (6% on a constant currency basis). The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables and resulting pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 towards pre-pandemic levels.\nLatin America pawn loan fees increased 16% (10% on a constant currency basis), totaling $170.4 million during 2021 compared to $147.1 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees increased 14% (8% on a constant currency basis) during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in total and same-store constant currency pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued improvement of pawn loan origination activity during 2021, partially offset by significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 8% (3% on a constant currency basis) to $179.0 million during 2021 compared to $165.5 million during 2020. Same-store operating expenses increased 6% (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $121.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 21% compared to $106.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin was primarily due to an increase in gross profit from retail sales and pawn loan fees and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from scrap sales and an increase in store operating expenses.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment\nThe Company completed the AFF Acquisition on December 17, 2021 and the results of operations of AFF have been consolidated since the acquisition date.

These results are significantly impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments as noted in the retail POS payment solutions segment above.\nCorporate Expenses and Taxes\nAdministrative expenses increased less than 1% to $111.3 million during 2021 compared to $110.9 million during 2020, primarily due to increased incentive compensation and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso resulting in higher U.S. dollar translated expenses, partially offset by reduced travel costs and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 7% during 2021 and 2020.\nInterest expense increased 10% to $32.4 million during 2021 compared to $29.3 million for 2020, primarily related to the December 13, 2021 issuance of the $550.0 million senior unsecured notes due in 2030 and increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and acquisition expenses increased to $15.4 million during 2021 compared to $1.3 million during 2020, reflecting transaction costs primarily related to the AFF Acquisition in 2021.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company recognized a gain of $17.9 million during 2021 as a result of a decrease in the liability for the estimated fair value of certain contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition which is tied to the Company's stock price. The gain was due to the increase in the Company's stock price from $62.83 on December 16, 2021 to $74.81 on December 31, 2021, which decreased the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a $1.6 million and $7.1 million write-off of certain merger related lease intangibles, respectively. The lease intangibles, which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets, were recorded in conjunction with the Cash America merger and were written-off primarily as a result of the Company purchasing the store real estate from the landlords of certain existing legacy Cash America stores. During 2021, the Company also recorded a $0.7 million gain on the sale of real estate, and during 2020, the Company also recorded a $1.9 million impairment of other assets and a $1.5 million impairment of property and equipment.\nDuring 2020, the Company redeemed its outstanding $300.0 million, 5.375% senior notes due 2024, incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.7 million, which includes an early redemption premium and other redemption costs of $8.8 million and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 25.0% and 25.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased foreign permanent tax benefit recorded during 2021 related to an increased inflation index adjustment allowed in Mexico as a result of elevated inflation during 2021, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized in 2020 resulting from the Internal Revenue Service finalizing regulations for the GILTI provisions for foreign operations in the U.S. federal tax code, which essentially eliminated the impact of the incremental GILTI tax on the Company. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMaterial Capital Requirements\nThe Company's primary capital requirements include:\n\u2022Expand pawn operations through growth of pawn receivables and inventories in existing stores, new store openings and strategic acquisition of pawn stores;\n\u2022Expand retail POS payment solutions operations through growth of the business generated from new and existing merchant partners;\n\u25e6Expected to result in additional purchases of lease merchandise, funding of additional finance receivables and an increase in servicing and collection activities to support increased leases and finance receivables outstanding;\n\u25e6Expected to require operational support and development activities around AFF's proprietary loan management and decisioning systems along with merchant and customer service functions; and\n\u2022Return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nOther material capital requirements include operating expenses (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding operating lease commitments), general corporate operating activities, income tax payments and debt service among others. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities and available and unused funds under its revolving unsecured credit facilities will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months.\nExpand Pawn Operations\nThe Company intends to continue expansion through new store openings, primarily in Latin America. The impacts of COVID-19 limited the number of 2021 new store openings to 61. For 2022, the Company expects to add up to 60 de novo full-service pawn locations in Latin America. Future store openings remain subject to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, the ability to continue construction projects and obtain necessary licenses and permits, utility services, store equipment, supplies and staffing.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential pawn store acquisition opportunities and will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. The Company acquired 46 pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired a pawn license that will be used to open a new pawn store in the state of Nevada during 2022 for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments.\nAlthough viewed by management as a discretionary expenditure not required to operate its pawn stores, the Company may continue to purchase real estate from its landlords at existing stores or in conjunction with pawn store acquisitions, as opportunities arise at reasonable valuations. The Company purchased the real estate at 54 store locations, primarily from landlords at existing stores, for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million during 2021.\nExpand Retail POS Payment Solutions Operations\nAFF will continue to promote and build relationships with existing customers and merchants and believes there is an opportunity to increase the share of existing merchants' overall transaction volumes. While existing merchant partner relationships represent a significant source of AFF's origination volumes, the Company believes there are also many more untapped traditional and e-commerce merchants providing goods and services to customers that could benefit from offering AFF's retail POS payment solutions. AFF has made, and intends to continue to make, investments in its marketing team to drive awareness of AFF's products at its merchant partners to increase utilization and encourage repeat business through increased marketing directly to AFF's customers. In addition, AFF has made and intends to continue to make investments in its unique and proprietary decisioning platform.\nReturn of Capital to Shareholders\nIn February 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.30 per share first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $14.5 million based on the December 31, 2021 share count, to be paid on February 28, 2022 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2022. While the Company currently expects to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends, the amount, declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors including the impact of COVID-19.\nDuring 2021, the Company repurchased a total of 688,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $49.6 million and an average cost per share of $72.10, and during 2020, repurchased 1,427,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $107.0 million and an average cost per share of $74.96. The Company has approximately $72.2 million of remaining availability under its currently authorized stock repurchase program. While the Company intends to continue repurchases under its active share repurchase program, future share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, dividend policy, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, including acquisitions, and the impact of COVID-19.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to enter into interest rate hedge transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were $120.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $267.0 million of available and unused funds under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities, subject to certain financial covenants (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company had working capital of $737.2 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 included $57.5 million held by its foreign subsidiaries. These cash balances, which are primarily held in Mexican pesos, are associated with foreign earnings the Company has asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which the Company primarily plans to use to support its continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of the Company's foreign operations. Primarily as a result of reduced store opening and acquisition activity, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, the Company elected to repatriate $10.0 million from certain foreign subsidiaries during 2021.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe continued developments and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to predict the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company's liquidity and presents a material uncertainty, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future. Other factors, such as changes in general customer traffic and demand, pawn loan balances, loan-to-value ratios, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, LTO and finance receivable originations, collection of lease and finance receivable payments, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to merger and acquisition activities, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new pawn store expansion and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Additionally, a prolonged reduction in earnings and EBITDA could limit the Company's future ability to fully borrow on its credit facilities under current leverage covenants. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See Item 1. Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nIf needed, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, repatriation of excess cash held in Latin America, the sale of assets, reductions in operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends, the forbearance or deferral of operating expenses, the issuance of debt or equity securities, leveraging currently unencumbered real estate owned by the Company and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory, which accounts for approximately 49% of total inventory, gives the Company flexibility to quickly increase cash flow, if necessary.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Metrics\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(744,637) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,352) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(137,053) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>576,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(186,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(120,806) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>737,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>418,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>538,087 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio </td> <td>2.9:1 </td> <td>3.0:1 </td> <td>3.7:1 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 million from $222.3 million for 2020 to $223.3 million for 2021, due to net changes in certain non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to operating cash flow and net changes in other operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows), and an increase in net income of $18.3 million.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $724.3 million, or 3,559%, from $20.4 million during 2020 to $744.6 million during 2021. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund acquisitions, purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements, which includes capital expenditures for improvements to existing pawn stores and for new pawn store openings and other corporate assets, and discretionary purchases of store real property. In addition, cash flows related to the funding of new pawn loans, net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral, and finance receivables are included in investing activities. The portion of the AFF Acquisition consideration paid in cash, net of cash acquired, was $462.1 million while the Company also paid $81.8 million in cash related to current and prior-year pawn store acquisitions, $42.0 million for furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and $79.5 million for discretionary pawn store real property purchases during 2021 compared to $44.3 million, $37.5 million and $45.5 million in 2020, respectively. The Company funded a net increase in pawn loans of $73.3 million during 2021, whereas the Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn loans of $105.4 million during 2020, and the Company funded a net increase in finance receivables of $5.8 million during 2021.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $763.5 million, or 409%, from net cash used in financing activities of $186.5 million during 2020 to net cash provided by financing activities of $577.0 million during 2021. Net borrowings on the credit facilities were $136.0 million during 2021 compared to net payments of $215.5 million during 2020. During 2021, the Company received $550.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $10.6 million in debt issuance costs which was used primarily to fund the acquisition of AFF. During 2020, the Company received $500.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $8.0 million in debt issuance costs. Using part of the proceeds from these senior unsecured notes, the Company redeemed $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes and paid redemption premiums and other redemption costs of $8.8 million during 2020. The Company funded $49.6 million for share repurchases and paid dividends of $47.5 million during 2021, compared to funding $107.0 million of share repurchases and dividends paid of $44.8 million during 2020. In addition, the Company paid $1.7 million in withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock unit awards and stock options exercised and received $0.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2021, compared to $3.7 million and $1.1 million, during 2020, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted retail POS payment solutions segment metrics and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWhile acquisitions are an important part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods, which include the Company's transaction expenses incurred in connection with its acquisition of AFF. In addition, the Company does not consider these merger and acquisition expenses to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations and such expenses are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities, among others.\nThe Company has certain leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The lease liability of these U.S. dollar denominated leases, which is considered a monetary liability, is remeasured into Mexican pesos using current period exchange rates resulting in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses because they are non-cash, non-operating items that could create volatility in the Company's consolidated results of operations due to the magnitude of the end of period lease liability being remeasured and to improve comparability of current periods presented with prior periods.\nIn conjunction with the Cash America merger in 2016, the Company recorded certain lease intangibles related to above or below market lease liabilities of Cash America which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets. As the Company continues to opportunistically purchase real estate from landlords at certain Cash America stores, the associated lease intangible, if any, is written-off and gain or loss is recognized. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these gains or losses given the variability in size and timing of these transactions and because they are non-cash, non-operating gains or losses. The Company believes this improves comparability of operating results for current periods presented with prior periods.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted

The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and net fundings/repayments of pawn loan and finance receivables, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted for merger and acquisition expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature.\nFree cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow from investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pawn loans, net (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(73,340) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance receivables, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,844) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,022) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,543) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,311) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow </td> <td> </td> <td>102,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,691 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and acquisition expenses paid, net of tax benefit </td> <td> </td> <td>11,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted free cash flow </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes the funding of new loans net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral.\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nManagement believes the presentation of certain retail POS payment solutions segment metrics adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of AFF's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, which management believes is non-operating in nature and not representative of AFF's core operating performance. See the retail POS payment solutions segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain amounts adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting to as reported GAAP amounts.\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America pawn segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nEffects of Inflation\nDuring 2021, the Company does not believe inflation had a material effect on the volume of pawn loans originated by the Company or AFF's transaction volume, merchandise sales of the Company, or the Company's results of operations during 2021. Widely reported inflation has occurred, however, and may be ongoing into the foreseeable future. Depending on the severity and persistence of these inflationary pressures, the Company could see a negative impact on its customers' ability to pay (including an impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable) for its goods and services as well as increases in wages and other operating costs. However, inflationary economic environments could also benefit the Company by increasing customer demand for value priced products and lending services in its pawn stores.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations, and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of pawn service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to pawn loan balance growth. Pawn service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the typical repayment period of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. In addition, AFF customers generally exercise the early buyout option on their existing lease or finance receivable more frequently during the first quarter associated with tax refund proceeds. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds in the U.S.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of AFF, which is a leading technology-driven retail POS payments platform primarily focused on providing LTO products. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the AFF Acquisition.\nWith the AFF Acquisition, the Company now operates two business lines: pawn operations and retail POS payment solutions. Its business lines are organized into three reportable segments. The U.S. pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in the U.S. and the Latin America pawn segment consists of all pawn operations in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and El Salvador. The retail POS payment solutions segment consists of the operations of AFF in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Financial information regarding the Company's revenue and long-lived assets by geographic areas is provided in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's primary business line continues to be the operation of retail pawn stores, also known as pawnshops,\u201d which focus on serving cash and credit-constrained consumers. Pawn stores help customers meet small short-term cash needs by providing non-recourse pawn loans and buying merchandise directly from customers. Personal property, such as jewelry, electronics, tools, appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments, is pledged and held as collateral for the pawn loans over the typical 30-day term of the loan. Pawn stores also generate retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers.\nThe Company's retail POS payment solutions business line consists solely of the operations of AFF, which focuses on providing LTO and retail financing payment options across a large network of traditional and e-commerce retail merchant partners in all 50 states in the U.S., the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. AFF's retail partnerships provide consumer goods and services to their shoppers and use AFF's LTO and retail finance solutions to facilitate payments on such transactions. As one of the largest omni-channel providers of no credit required\u201d payment options, AFF's technology set provides its merchant partners with seamless leasing and financing experiences in-store, online, in-cart and on mobile devices.\nBusiness operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The following table provides exchange rates for the Mexican peso, Guatemalan quetzal and Colombian peso for the current and prior-year periods:\n\n\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars, and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, which are billed and paid in U.S. dollars. Amounts presented on a constant currency basis are denoted as such. See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional discussion of constant currency operating results.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenue and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates, assumptions and judgments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates that could have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nPawn loans and revenue recognition - Pawn loans are secured by the customer's pledge of tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan. If a pawn loan defaults, the Company relies on the sale of the pawned property to recover the principal amount of an unpaid pawn loan, plus a yield on the investment, as the Company's pawn loans are non-recourse against the customer. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If the pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the pawn loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the principal amount loaned becomes the inventory carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value. The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount.\nPawn inventories and revenue recognition - Pawn inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawn loans and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Pawn inventories from forfeited pawn loans are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Pawn inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of pawn inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Pawn inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, valuation allowances are established if pawn inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated pawn inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.\nThe Company's merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. Some jewelry inventory is melted and processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.\nLeased merchandise and revenue recognition - The Company provides merchandise, consisting primarily of furniture and mattresses, appliances, jewelry, electronics and automotive products, to customers of its merchant partners for lease under certain terms agreed to by the customer. The customer has the right to acquire the title either through an early buyout option or through payment of all required lease payments. The Company maintains ownership of the leased merchandise until all payment obligations are satisfied under the lease agreement. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time by returning the merchandise and making all scheduled payments due through the minimum lease holding period, which is typically 60 days. Leased merchandise contracts can typically be renewed for between six to 24 months. Leased merchandise is stated at depreciated cost. The Company depreciates leased merchandise over the life of the lease, and assumes no salvage value. Depreciation is accelerated upon an early buyout. All of the Company's leased merchandise represents on-lease merchandise and all leases are operating leases.\n\nLease income is recognized over the lease term and is recorded net of any sales taxes collected. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. Initial direct costs related to the Company\u02bcs lease agreements are added to the basis of the leased property and recognized over the lease term in proportion to the recognition of lease income. The Company typically charges the customer a non-refundable processing fee at lease inception and may also receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for leases originated at their locations, which are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method as adjustments to lease income over the contractual life of the related leased merchandise. Unamortized fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early buyout or charge-off.\nThe Company accrues for lease income earned but not yet collected as accrued rent receivable, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Alternatively, lease payments received in excess of the amount earned are recognized as deferred revenue, which is included in customer deposits and prepayments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Customer payments are first applied to applicable sales tax and scheduled lease payments, then applied to any uncollected fees, such as late fees and insufficient fund fees. The Company collects sales taxes on behalf of the customer and remits all applicable sales taxes collected to the respective jurisdiction.\nProvision for lease losses - The Company records a provision for lease losses on an allowance method, which estimates the leased merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period. The allowance for lease losses is based primarily upon historical loss experience with consideration given to recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices.\nThe Company charges off leased merchandise when a lease is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the leased merchandise at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nFinance receivables and revenue recognition - The Company purchases and services retail finance receivables, the term of which typically range from six to 24 months, directly from its merchant partners or from its bank partner. The Company has a partnership with a Utah state-chartered bank that requires the Company to purchase the rights to the cash flows associated with finance receivables marketed to retail consumers on the bank's behalf. The bank establishes the underwriting criteria for the finance receivables originated by the bank.\nInterest income is recognized using the interest method over the life of the finance receivable for all loans for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical loan redemption statistics and stops accruing interest upon charge-off. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. The Company receives an origination fee on newly purchased bank loans and may receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for finance receivables purchased from them, which are deferred and amortized using the interest method as adjustments to yield over the contractual life of the related finance receivable. Unamortized origination fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early payoff or charge-off.\nThe Company offers customers an early payoff discount on most of its finance receivables whereby the customer has between 90 and 105 days to pay the full principal balance without incurring any interest charge. If the borrower does not pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period, interest charges are applied retroactively to the inception date of the loan. The Company accrues interest income during the early payoff discount period but records a reserve for loans expected to pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period based on historical payment patterns.\nProvision for loan losses - Expected lifetime losses on finance receivables are recognized upon loan purchase, which requires the Company to make its best estimate of probable lifetime losses at the time of purchase. The Company segments its finance receivable portfolio into pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics which include loan product and monthly origination vintage and evaluates each pool for impairment.\nThe Company calculates the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss information and incorporates observable and forecasted economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period covering the full contractual life of finance receivables. Incorporating observable and forecasted economic conditions could have a material impact on the measurement of the allowance to the extent that forecasted economic conditions change significantly. The Company may also consider other qualitative factors to address recent and forecasted business trends in estimating the allowance, as necessary, including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to cover expected lifetime losses on the finance receivable portfolio, and the appropriateness of the allowance is evaluated at each period end.\n\nThe Company charges off finance receivables when a receivable is 90 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the finance receivable at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.\nBusiness combinations - Business combination accounting requires the Company to determine the fair value of all assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. The total consideration of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability as of the acquisition date, and any remaining acquisition consideration is classified as goodwill. This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions. When appropriate, the Company utilizes independent valuation experts to advise and assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with a business acquisition, in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for identified intangible assets and in determining the fair value of contingent consideration, which is reviewed at each subsequent reporting period with changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company's reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. pawn, Latin America pawn and retail POS payment solutions. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company's products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors, such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the impairment testing methodology. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's other material indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names and pawn licenses. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nResults of Operations\n2021 Consolidated Operating Results Highlights\nThe following table sets forth revenue, net income, diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Information-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and -Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below.\nThe following charts present net income, adjusted net income, diluted earnings per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and earning assets, which consist of pawn loans, finance receivables, inventories and leased merchandise, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts):\n* Non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Information\u201d for additional discussion of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nOperating Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact numerous aspects of the Company's business and the continuing long-term impact to its business remains unknown. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company's operations, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the unknown duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be impacted by variants of concern and the efficacy and adoption rate of the COVID-19 vaccines in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, changes in economic conditions and consumer spending, rising inflation, and the actions taken to limit the economic impact of COVID-19, such as government stimulus and other transfer programs, have and may continue to have a material adverse impact on demand for pawn loans in future periods. Moreover, safety protocols, staffing constraints and supply chain delays continue to impact operations and traffic counts for many retailers, which include the Company's pawn stores and many of AFF's retail merchant partners.\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for the Company's operations by reporting segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For similar operating and financial data and discussion of the Company's 2020 results compared to its 2019 results, refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under Part II of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on February 1, 2021.\nStores included in the same-store calculations presented in the U.S. pawn segment and Latin America pawn segment sections below are those stores that were opened or acquired prior to the beginning of the prior-year comparative period and remained open through the end of the reporting period. Also included are stores that were relocated during the applicable period within a specified distance serving the same market where there is not a significant change in store size and where there is not a significant overlap or gap in timing between the opening of the new store and the closing of the existing store.\n\nU.S. Pawn Segment\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans and inventories, as well as other earning asset metrics of the U.S. pawn segment as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income and other operating metrics of the U.S. pawn segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands). Operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of pawn store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the pawn stores.\n\n(1)Effective June 30, 2020, the Company's U.S. pawn segment ceased offering an unsecured consumer loan product.\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nU.S. retail merchandise sales increased 3% to $742.4 million during 2021 compared to $720.3 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales were flat during 2021 compared to 2020. The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales in the U.S. was 44% during 2021 compared to a margin of 42% during 2020. The increase in margin was primarily a result of continued retail demand for value-priced pre-owned merchandise, increased buying of merchandise directly from customers and lower levels of aged inventory, which limited the need for normal discounting.\nU.S. inventories increased 45% from $136.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $197.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in the U.S. were 1% at December 31, 2021 compared to 2% at December 31, 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nU.S. pawn loan receivables as of December 31, 2021 increased 16% in total and 13% on a same-store basis compared to December 31, 2020. The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 to pre-pandemic levels as the economy reopened and government stimulus programs were curtailed.\nU.S. pawn loan fees decreased 2% to $305.4 million during 2021 compared to $310.4 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees decreased 4% during 2021 compared to 2020. The decline in total and same-store pawn loan fees was primarily due to the significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels, partially offset by the continued recovery in pawn loan demand towards pre-pandemic levels during 2021.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nU.S. store operating expenses decreased 4% to $380.9 million during 2021 compared to $396.6 million during 2020 and same-store operating expenses decreased 6% compared with the prior-year period. The decrease in total and same-store operating expenses was primarily due to reduced staffing levels and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19, partially offset by increased store-level incentive compensation driven by increased revenues towards the latter part of 2021.\nThe U.S. segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $232.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 22% compared to $204.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin reflected an increase in gross profit from retail sales and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a slight decrease in pawn loan fees, gross profit from scrap sales and net revenue from consumer loan and credit services products as a result of discontinuing consumer lending operations in U.S. pawn stores in 2020.\n\nLatin America Pawn Segment\nThe Company's management reviews and analyzes operating results in Latin America on a constant currency basis because the Company believes this better represents the Company's underlying business trends. Constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current-year results at prior-year average exchange rates. The wholesale scrap jewelry sales in Latin America are priced and settled in U.S. dollars and are not affected by foreign currency translation, as are a small percentage of the operating and administrative expenses in Latin America, that are billed and paid in U.S. dollars.\nLatin American results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 were impacted by a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar. The translated value of Latin American earning assets as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was also impacted by a 4% unfavorable change in the end-of-period value of the Mexican peso compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table details earning assets, which consist of pawn loans and inventories as well as other earning asset metrics of the Latin America pawn segment as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except as otherwise noted):\n\n\nThe following table presents segment pre-tax operating income and other operating metrics of the Latin America pawn segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands). Operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of pawn store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the pawn stores.\n\n\nRetail Merchandise Sales Operations\nLatin America inventories increased 21% (25% on a constant currency basis) from $54.2 million at December 31, 2020 to $65.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower than normal inventory balances at December 31, 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inventories aged greater than one year in Latin America were 1% at December 31, 2021 and 2% at December 31, 2020.\nLatin America retail merchandise sales increased 10% (4% on a constant currency basis) to $391.9 million during 2021 compared to $355.2 million for 2020. Same-store retail sales increased 8% (2% on a constant currency basis). The gross profit margin on retail merchandise sales was 37% during 2021 and 2020.\nPawn Lending Operations\nLatin America pawn loan receivables increased 4% (7% on a constant currency basis) as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, and on a same-store basis, increased by 3% (6% on a constant currency basis). The increase in total and same-store pawn receivables and resulting pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued recovery in pawn lending demand during 2021 towards pre-pandemic levels.\nLatin America pawn loan fees increased 16% (10% on a constant currency basis), totaling $170.4 million during 2021 compared to $147.1 million for 2020. Same-store pawn fees increased 14% (8% on a constant currency basis) during 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in total and same-store constant currency pawn loan fees was primarily due to the continued improvement of pawn loan origination activity during 2021, partially offset by significantly lower than normal beginning pawn loan levels.\nSegment Expenses and Segment Pre-Tax Operating Income\nStore operating expenses increased 8% (3% on a constant currency basis) to $179.0 million during 2021 compared to $165.5 million during 2020. Same-store operating expenses increased 6% (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior-year period.\nThe segment pre-tax operating income for 2021 was $121.8 million, which generated a pre-tax segment operating margin of 21% compared to $106.7 million and 19% in the prior year, respectively. The increase in the segment pre-tax operating income and margin was primarily due to an increase in gross profit from retail sales and pawn loan fees and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from scrap sales and an increase in store operating expenses.\n\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment\nThe Company completed the AFF Acquisition on December 17, 2021 and the results of operations of AFF have been consolidated since the acquisition date. The Company has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and allocated the aggregate purchase consideration based on the fair values of those identifiable assets and liabilities. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the AFF Acquisition.\nAs a result of purchase accounting, AFF's as reported earning assets, consisting of finance receivables and leased merchandise, contain significant fair value adjustments. The fair value adjustments will be amortized over the life of the lease contracts and finance receivables acquired at the time of acquisition. Future originations of finance receivables and purchases of leased merchandise will be accounted for as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table provides a detail of finance receivables as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\n(1) As reported acquired finance receivables was recorded at fair value in conjunction with purchase accounting. Adjustment represents the difference between the original amortized cost basis and fair value of the remaining acquired finance receivables.\nThe following table provides a detail of leased merchandise as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n\n(1) As reported acquired leased merchandise was recorded at fair value (which includes estimates for charge-offs) in conjunction with purchase accounting. Adjustment represents the difference between the original depreciated cost and fair value of the remaining acquired leased merchandise.\n(2) As reported allowance for lease losses represents the provision for lease losses for leases originated between December 17, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Adjustment represents the remaining allowance for lease losses of acquired leased merchandise, which is included in the fair value of the acquired leased merchandise described in (1) above.\n\nAFF's as reported results of operations also contain significant purchase accounting impacts. The following table presents segment pre-tax operating income as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting for the period from December 17, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (in thousands). Operating expenses include salary and benefit expense of certain operations focused departments, merchant partner incentives, bank and other payment processing charges, credit reporting costs, information technology costs, advertising costs and other operational costs incurred by AFF. Administrative expenses of AFF are not included in the segment pre-tax operating income.\n\n(1) As reported provision for loan losses includes the establishment of the initial allowance for expected lifetime credit losses for acquired finance receivables not considered purchased credit deteriorated, which is recorded as an expense in the loan loss provision. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2) Amortization of identified intangible assets in the AFF Acquisition are considered corporate expenses and not included in segment depreciation and amortization.\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table reconciles pre-tax operating income of the Company's U.S. pawn segment, Latin America pawn segment and retail POS payment solutions segment discussed above to consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1) Includes the results of operations for AFF for the period December 17, 2021 to December 31, 2021. These results are significantly impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments as noted in the retail POS payment solutions segment above.\nCorporate Expenses and Taxes\nAdministrative expenses increased less than 1% to $111.3 million during 2021 compared to $110.9 million during 2020, primarily due to increased incentive compensation and a 6% favorable change in the average value of the Mexican peso resulting in higher U.S. dollar translated expenses, partially offset by reduced travel costs and other cost saving initiatives in response to COVID-19. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 7% during 2021 and 2020.\nInterest expense increased 10% to $32.4 million during 2021 compared to $29.3 million for 2020, primarily related to the December 13, 2021 issuance of the $550.0 million senior unsecured notes due in 2030 and increased borrowings on the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMerger and acquisition expenses increased to $15.4 million during 2021 compared to $1.3 million during 2020, reflecting transaction costs primarily related to the AFF Acquisition in 2021.\n\nThe Company recognized a gain of $17.9 million during 2021 as a result of a decrease in the liability for the estimated fair value of certain contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition which is tied to the Company's stock price. The gain was due to the increase in the Company's stock price from $62.83 on December 16, 2021 to $74.81 on December 31, 2021, which decreased the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. See Note 3 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the contingent consideration related to the AFF Acquisition.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a $1.6 million and $7.1 million write-off of certain merger related lease intangibles, respectively. The lease intangibles, which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets, were recorded in conjunction with the Cash America merger and were written-off primarily as a result of the Company purchasing the store real estate from the landlords of certain existing legacy Cash America stores. During 2021, the Company also recorded a $0.7 million gain on the sale of real estate, and during 2020, the Company also recorded a $1.9 million impairment of other assets and a $1.5 million impairment of property and equipment.\nDuring 2020, the Company redeemed its outstanding $300.0 million, 5.375% senior notes due 2024, incurring a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.7 million, which includes an early redemption premium and other redemption costs of $8.8 million and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.9 million.\nThe consolidated effective income tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 25.0% and 25.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increased foreign permanent tax benefit recorded during 2021 related to an increased inflation index adjustment allowed in Mexico as a result of elevated inflation during 2021, partially offset by a tax benefit recognized in 2020 resulting from the Internal Revenue Service finalizing regulations for the GILTI provisions for foreign operations in the U.S. federal tax code, which essentially eliminated the impact of the incremental GILTI tax on the Company. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMaterial Capital Requirements\nThe Company's primary capital requirements include:\n\u2022Expand pawn operations through growth of pawn receivables and inventories in existing stores, new store openings and strategic acquisition of pawn stores;\n\u2022Expand retail POS payment solutions operations through growth of the business generated from new and existing merchant partners;\n\u25e6Expected to result in additional purchases of lease merchandise, funding of additional finance receivables and an increase in servicing and collection activities to support increased leases and finance receivables outstanding;\n\u25e6Expected to require operational support and development activities around AFF's proprietary loan management and decisioning systems along with merchant and customer service functions; and\n\u2022Return capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nOther material capital requirements include operating expenses (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding operating lease commitments), general corporate operating activities, income tax payments and debt service among others. The Company believes that net cash provided by operating activities and available and unused funds under its revolving unsecured credit facilities will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital needs for these items in the short-term over the next 12 months and also in the long-term beyond the next 12 months.\nExpand Pawn Operations\nThe Company intends to continue expansion through new store openings, primarily in Latin America. The impacts of COVID-19 limited the number of 2021 new store openings to 61. For 2022, the Company expects to add up to 60 de novo full-service pawn locations in Latin America. Future store openings remain subject to uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, the ability to continue construction projects and obtain necessary licenses and permits, utility services, store equipment, supplies and staffing.\n\nThe Company continually looks for, and is presented with, potential pawn store acquisition opportunities and will evaluate potential acquisitions based upon growth potential, purchase price, available liquidity, debt covenant restrictions, strategic fit and quality of management personnel, among other factors. The Company acquired 46 pawn stores in the U.S. and acquired a pawn license that will be used to open a new pawn store in the state of Nevada during 2022 for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments.\nAlthough viewed by management as a discretionary expenditure not required to operate its pawn stores, the Company may continue to purchase real estate from its landlords at existing stores or in conjunction with pawn store acquisitions, as opportunities arise at reasonable valuations. The Company purchased the real estate at 54 store locations, primarily from landlords at existing stores, for a cumulative purchase price of $79.5 million during 2021.\nExpand Retail POS Payment Solutions Operations\nAFF will continue to promote and build relationships with existing customers and merchants and believes there is an opportunity to increase the share of existing merchants' overall transaction volumes. While existing merchant partner relationships represent a significant source of AFF's origination volumes, the Company believes there are also many more untapped traditional and e-commerce merchants providing goods and services to customers that could benefit from offering AFF's retail POS payment solutions. AFF has made, and intends to continue to make, investments in its marketing team to drive awareness of AFF's products at its merchant partners to increase utilization and encourage repeat business through increased marketing directly to AFF's customers. In addition, AFF has made and intends to continue to make investments in its unique and proprietary decisioning platform.\nReturn of Capital to Shareholders\nIn February 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.30 per share first quarter cash dividend on common shares outstanding, or an aggregate of $14.5 million based on the December 31, 2021 share count, to be paid on February 28, 2022 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2022. While the Company currently expects to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends, the amount, declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board of Directors, from time to time, subject to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors including the impact of COVID-19.\nDuring 2021, the Company repurchased a total of 688,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $49.6 million and an average cost per share of $72.10, and during 2020, repurchased 1,427,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $107.0 million and an average cost per share of $74.96. The Company has approximately $72.2 million of remaining availability under its currently authorized stock repurchase program. While the Company intends to continue repurchases under its active share repurchase program, future share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company's stock, dividend policy, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, including acquisitions, and the impact of COVID-19.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its capital structure, including through consideration of the issuance of debt or equity, to refinance existing debt and to enter into interest rate hedge transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity were $120.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $267.0 million of available and unused funds under the Company's revolving unsecured credit facilities, subject to certain financial covenants (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company had working capital of $737.2 million as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 included $57.5 million held by its foreign subsidiaries. These cash balances, which are primarily held in Mexican pesos, are associated with foreign earnings the Company has asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which the Company primarily plans to use to support its continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of the Company's foreign operations. Primarily as a result of reduced store opening and acquisition activity, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, the Company elected to repatriate $10.0 million from certain foreign subsidiaries during 2021.\n\nThe continued developments and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to predict the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company's liquidity and presents a material uncertainty, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future. Other factors, such as changes in general customer traffic and demand, pawn loan balances, loan-to-value ratios, collection of pawn fees, merchandise sales, inventory levels, LTO and finance receivable originations, collection of lease and finance receivable payments, seasonality, operating expenses, administrative expenses, expenses related to merger and acquisition activities, tax rates, gold prices, foreign currency exchange rates and the pace of new pawn store expansion and acquisitions, affect the Company's liquidity. Additionally, a prolonged reduction in earnings and EBITDA could limit the Company's future ability to fully borrow on its credit facilities under current leverage covenants. Regulatory developments affecting the Company's operations may also impact profitability and liquidity. See Item 1. Business-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nIf needed, the Company could seek to raise additional funds from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, repatriation of excess cash held in Latin America, the sale of assets, reductions in operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends, the forbearance or deferral of operating expenses, the issuance of debt or equity securities, leveraging currently unencumbered real estate owned by the Company and/or changes to its management of current assets. The characteristics of the Company's current assets, specifically the ability to rapidly liquidate gold jewelry inventory, which accounts for approximately 49% of total inventory, gives the Company flexibility to quickly increase cash flow, if necessary.\nCash Flows and Liquidity Metrics\nThe following tables set forth certain historical information with respect to the Company's sources and uses of cash and other key indicators of liquidity (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 million from $222.3 million for 2020 to $223.3 million for 2021, due to net changes in certain non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to operating cash flow and net changes in other operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows), and an increase in net income of $18.3 million.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $724.3 million, or 3,559%, from $20.4 million during 2020 to $744.6 million during 2021. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund acquisitions, purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements, which includes capital expenditures for improvements to existing pawn stores and for new pawn store openings and other corporate assets, and discretionary purchases of store real property. In addition, cash flows related to the funding of new pawn loans, net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral, and finance receivables are included in investing activities. The portion of the AFF Acquisition consideration paid in cash, net of cash acquired, was $462.1 million while the Company also paid $81.8 million in cash related to current and prior-year pawn store acquisitions, $42.0 million for furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and $79.5 million for discretionary pawn store real property purchases during 2021 compared to $44.3 million, $37.5 million and $45.5 million in 2020, respectively. The Company funded a net increase in pawn loans of $73.3 million during 2021, whereas the Company received funds from a net decrease in pawn loans of $105.4 million during 2020, and the Company funded a net increase in finance receivables of $5.8 million during 2021.\n\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $763.5 million, or 409%, from net cash used in financing activities of $186.5 million during 2020 to net cash provided by financing activities of $577.0 million during 2021. Net borrowings on the credit facilities were $136.0 million during 2021 compared to net payments of $215.5 million during 2020. During 2021, the Company received $550.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $10.6 million in debt issuance costs which was used primarily to fund the acquisition of AFF. During 2020, the Company received $500.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes and paid $8.0 million in debt issuance costs. Using part of the proceeds from these senior unsecured notes, the Company redeemed $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes and paid redemption premiums and other redemption costs of $8.8 million during 2020. The Company funded $49.6 million for share repurchases and paid dividends of $47.5 million during 2021, compared to funding $107.0 million of share repurchases and dividends paid of $44.8 million during 2020. In addition, the Company paid $1.7 million in withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock unit awards and stock options exercised and received $0.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2021, compared to $3.7 million and $1.1 million, during 2020, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted retail POS payment solutions segment metrics and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company's operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company's core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWhile acquisitions are an important part of the Company's overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods, which include the Company's transaction expenses incurred in connection with its acquisition of AFF. In addition, the Company does not consider these merger and acquisition expenses to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations and such expenses are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities, among others.\nThe Company has certain leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The lease liability of these U.S. dollar denominated leases, which is considered a monetary liability, is remeasured into Mexican pesos using current period exchange rates resulting in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses because they are non-cash, non-operating items that could create volatility in the Company's consolidated results of operations due to the magnitude of the end of period lease liability being remeasured and to improve comparability of current periods presented with prior periods.\nIn conjunction with the Cash America merger in 2016, the Company recorded certain lease intangibles related to above or below market lease liabilities of Cash America which are included in the operating lease right of use asset on the consolidated balance sheets. As the Company continues to opportunistically purchase real estate from landlords at certain Cash America stores, the associated lease intangible, if any, is written-off and gain or loss is recognized. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these gains or losses given the variability in size and timing of these transactions and because they are non-cash, non-operating gains or losses. The Company believes this improves comparability of operating results for current periods presented with prior periods.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nManagement believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and not representative of the Company's core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are shown net of tax (unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n(1)Includes $34.1 million related to the establishment of the initial allowance for expected lifetime credit losses for purchased AFF finance receivables that are not considered credit deteriorated (non-PCD loans), which is recorded as an expense in the provision for loan losses, $1.6 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets and $1.6 million related to other non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, partially offset by the $13.8 million gain on revaluation of AFF contingent acquisition consideration (all shown net of tax).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the gross amounts, the impact of income taxes and the net amounts for the adjustments included in the table above (unaudited, in thousands):\n\n\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and interest income and adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items as listed below that management considers to be non-operating in nature and not representative of its actual operating performance. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by investors to assess a company's financial performance, and adjusted EBITDA is used as a starting point in the calculation of the consolidated total debt ratio as defined in the Company's senior unsecured notes. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (unaudited, in thousands):\n\n(1)Excludes $2.1 million of amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which is already included in the add back of depreciation and amortization to calculate EBITDA.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nFor purposes of its internal liquidity assessments, the Company considers free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and net fundings/repayments of pawn loan and finance receivables, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted for merger and acquisition expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature.\nFree cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as an additional measure of cash generated by business operations that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (unaudited, in thousands):\n\n\n(1)Includes the funding of new loans net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral.\nRetail POS Payment Solutions Segment Purchase Accounting Adjustments\nManagement believes the presentation of certain retail POS payment solutions segment metrics adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of AFF's financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, which management believes is non-operating in nature and not representative of AFF's core operating performance. See the retail POS payment solutions segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain amounts adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting to as reported GAAP amounts.\nConstant Currency Results\nThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a constant currency\u201d basis, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are primarily transacted in local currencies.\nThe Company believes constant currency results provide valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company's management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of evaluating period-over-period comparisons. Business operations in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. See the Latin America pawn segment tables in Results of Operations\u201d above for additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.\nEffects of Inflation\nDuring 2021, the Company does not believe inflation had a material effect on the volume of pawn loans originated by the Company or AFF's transaction volume, merchandise sales of the Company, or the Company's results of operations during 2021. Widely reported inflation has occurred, however, and may be ongoing into the foreseeable future. Depending on the severity and persistence of these inflationary pressures, the Company could see a negative impact on its customers' ability to pay (including an impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable) for its goods and services as well as increases in wages and other operating costs. However, inflationary economic environments could also benefit the Company by increasing customer demand for value priced products and lending services in its pawn stores.\n\nSeasonality\nThe Company's business is subject to seasonal variations, and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of pawn service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to pawn loan balance growth. Pawn service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the typical repayment period of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. In addition, AFF customers generally exercise the early buyout option on their existing lease or finance receivable more frequently during the first quarter associated with tax refund proceeds. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds in the U.S.\nRecent Accounting

POS payments platform, in December 2021. This expands the company into a new business line of retail POS payment solutions.\n\n- The company has two main business lines now - pawn operations and retail POS payment solutions. It has three reporting segments - U.S pawn, Latin America pawn, and retail POS payment solutions.\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the company's operations and results. Pawn loan demand recovered towards pre-pandemic levels in 2021 as stimulus programs were curtailed. \n\n- For the U.S. pawn segment, earning assets increased 27% driven by growth in pawn loans and inventories. Segment pre-tax income increased 14% due to higher retail sales margins and lower expenses. \n\n- For the Latin America pawn segment, earning assets increased 11% on a reported basis and 14% on a constant currency basis. Segment pre-tax income increased 14% due to higher retail sales and pawn fees.\n\n- The retail POS payment solutions segment results for 2021 include significant impacts from the AFF acquisition accounting. On an adjusted basis, the segment had positive pre-tax income.\n\n- The company's overall net income increased 17% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by earnings growth in the pawn segments."}
