Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding us as provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences, including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans, equipment finance leases, indirect automobile loans, and municipal leases. We also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, as well as, commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities.\nWe are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as, government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles.\nOur primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, and gains and losses from sales of securities.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses which is required to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, expenses for occupancy, marketing and computer services, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our geographic footprint into seven additional markets through strategic acquisitions as well as three de novo commercial loan offices. Looking forward, we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nAt June 30, 2018, we had 43 locations in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro/\"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley).\nRecent Merger, Acquisition, and Consolidation Activity\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company opened a de novo branch office in Cary, North Carolina.\nOn August 1, 2017, the Company opened a commercial loan production office in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nOn January 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of TriSummit Bancorp, Inc. (\"TriSummit\") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 20, 2016, under which TriSummit merged with and into HomeTrust with HomeTrust as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, TriSummit's wholly owned subsidiary bank, TriSummit Bank, merged with and into the Bank. TriSummit had seven offices throughout the East Tennessee market. The acquisition added approximately $258.0 million in loans and $280.0 million in deposits.\nOn December 31, 2016, the Bank acquired United Financial of North Carolina, Inc. (\"United Financial\"), a municipal lease company headquartered in Fletcher, North Carolina that specializes in providing financing for fire departments and municipalities for the purchase of fire trucks and related equipment as well as the construction of fire stations and other municipal buildings across the Carolinas and other southeastern states. United Financial underwrites and originates these municipal leases and then sells them to HomeTrust and other financial institutions. Beginning January 1, 2017, United Financial has conducted business under the name United Financial, a division of HomeTrust Bank.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Bank consolidated six branch offices located in North Carolina and Tennessee. The closures were the result of a review of customer banking preferences and the current branch network. The Company had a nonrecurring impairment charge of $400,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 in relation to the consolidation of these offices.\nBusiness and Operating Strategy and Goals\nOur primary objective is to continue to operate and grow HomeTrust Bank as a well-capitalized, profitable, independent, community banking organization. Our mission is to create stockholder value by building relationships with our employees, customers, and communities in our primary markets in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro / \"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley) through exceptional service and helping our customers every day to be \"Ready For What's Next\" in their financial lives. We will also need to continue providing our employees with the tools necessary to effectively deliver our products and services to customers in order to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in our market areas and to fulfill our \"Commitment to the Customer Experience.\"\nContinuing to originate residential and commercial real estate loans and municipal leases. Our primary lending focus has been, and will continue to be, on operating as a residential and commercial mortgage lender. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate residential and commercial mortgage loans. Most of the long term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary market with servicing released, while most of the residential adjustable rate mortgages and fixed rate mortgages with terms to maturity of 15 years or less, all commercial real estate loans, and all municipal leases that we originate, are retained in our portfolio. We intend to continue to emphasize these lending activities particularly in the larger attractive markets we have added in the past several years.\nExpanding our lines of businesses. In our commitment to sound and profitable organic growth, we continuously focus on enhancing our lines of businesses. During fiscal year 2018, we added 13 additional commercial market presidents/relationship managers primarily throughout our seven metro markets to further expand our commercial and industrial lending, as well as our knowledge of the growing markets. During fiscal 2018, we implemented a new loan decision platform and overhauled our home equity lines of credit (\"HELOCs\") origination process resulting in 75% increase in branch originations and a 68% decrease in the amount of time to close the loan. Commercial loan originations for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016 were $590.5 million, $532.5 million, and $325.5 million, respectively. Fiscal year 2018 marked the fourth full year of our indirect auto finance line of business, which serves automobile dealerships, its owners, and consumers buying automobiles from these dealerships throughout western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Our focus on working with strong dealerships affords us the opportunity to expand into additional market areas and to actively deepen relationships through cross-selling opportunities, while building a strong reputation. Indirect auto loans grew to $173.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $140.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nBuilding on the momentum we have generated, we opened a de novo branch in Cary, North Carolina in March 2018 and a new Commercial LPO in Greensboro, North Carolina in August 2017. In addition, we began operations for our new SBA 7(a) loan program and equipment finance line of business. As we look forward, we will continue to focus on organic loan growth through both established and new lines of business as well as refocusing on business banking and consumer lending through branches.\nDisciplined franchise expansion. We believe opportunities currently exist within our new market areas to grow our franchise as illustrated by 84% of our commercial loan originations in fiscal year 2018 were originated by commercial relationship managers located in market areas we entered subsequent to 2012. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nMaintaining and improving asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.43% and 0.58% for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets at June 30, 2018 was 0.44% compared to 0.62% at June 30, 2017. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, an increased emphasis on a borrower's ongoing ability to repay a loan by requiring lower debt to income ratios, higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios than our previous lending policies had required. Although the Company intends to grow the commercial loan portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, the Company intends to manage credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers in this area, internal concentration limits, and a conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to manage the funding costs of our loan growth. We offer personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. To build our core deposit base, over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through a recently expanded product line tailored to our target business customers' needs. We are also pursuing a number of strategies that include enhancing our online and mobile banking platform, including improvements to online account opening and sales promotions on money market and checking accounts to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits. As a result, core deposits (which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts) have increased 6% during fiscal 2018 and were 77% of total deposits at June 30, 2018.\nImproving profitability through customer growth and balance sheet management. We are continuing to focus significant efforts on creating brand awareness, offering competitive products and employing a strong and experienced workforce. In order to deepen the relationships with our customers and increase individual customer profitability, we have continued our cross-marketing program, which allows us to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers when a new account is opened. In addition, we have targeted our direct mail campaigns to take advantage of competitor mergers and/or branch closures to acquire new customer core deposits. We believe these initiatives have positioned us well to implement a strategy focused on improving revenue growth and noninterest income.\nHiring and retaining experienced employees with a customer service focus. We have been successful in attracting and retaining banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of our markets, through both individual hires and business combinations, which is central to our business strategy. Exceptional service, local involvement and timely decision-making are integral parts of our business strategy, and we continue to seek additional highly qualified and motivated individuals. We believe that by focusing on experienced bankers who are established in their communities, we enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities. Our compensation and incentive systems are aligned with our strategies to grow core deposits and our loan portfolio as the economy improves, while improving asset quality. We have a strong corporate culture based on personal accountability and high ethical standards with an emphasis on \"character\" and \"competence\" across all our business lines and locations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nBusiness Combinations and Acquired Loans. We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires us as acquirer to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as, recognize goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase, if appropriate. Any acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred.\nWe account for purchased performing loans acquired in business combinations using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. We record purchased performing loans at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. We do not establish any allowance for loan losses for purchased performing loans, however we will record a provision for loan losses for any further deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nWe consider loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected as purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include the internal loan risk grade, delinquent and nonaccrual status, recent credit scores, and recent loan-to-value percentages. We initially record PCI loans at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Thus, we do not establish any allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date using specific credit reviews of certain loans and quantitative models incorporating credit risk, prepayment assumptions, and various other factors. These estimates require significant judgment given the impact of real estate prices, changing loss estimates, prepayment assumptions, and other relevant factors. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date, considering the impact of prepayments, is the nonaccretable difference and is available to absorb future loan chargeoffs.\nReal Estate Owned ( REO\u201d). REO represents real estate acquired as a result of customers' loan defaults. At the time of foreclosure, REO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell, which becomes the property's new basis. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent valuation adjustments to the carrying amount of the property are included in noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income. In some instances, we may make loans to facilitate the sales of REO. Management reviews all sales for which it is the lending institution for compliance with sales treatment under provisions established by Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 360, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.\u201d Any gains related to sales of REO may be deferred until the buyer has a sufficient initial and continuing investment in the property.\nGoodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to assess either qualitative or quantitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference, but limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Other identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include: efficiency ratio; tangible book value per share; tangible equity to tangible assets ratio; net interest income and net interest margin as adjusted to exclude additional Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings and proceeds from such borrowings; net income, earnings per share (\"EPS\"), return on assets (\"ROA\"), and return on equity (\"ROE\") excluding merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, adjustments for the change in federal tax law, and gain from the sale of premises and equipment; and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans excluding acquired loans.\nManagement elected to utilize short-term FHLB borrowings beginning in November 2014 as part of a leverage strategy to increase net interest income. The Company believes that showing the effects of these borrowings on net interest income and net interest margin is useful to both management and investors as these measures are commonly used to measure financial institution's performance and against peers.\nThe Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital and earnings ability over time and in comparison to its competitors. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total stockholders' equity or operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of our efficiency ratio:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>

Deposit growth of $147.8 million, or 7.2% and the cumulative decrease of $126.3 million, or 30.1% in cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit in other banks and investment securities during the year ended June 30, 2018 were used to partially fund the $174.4 million, or 7.4% increase in total loans receivable, the $79.2 million, or 52.9% increase in commercial paper, and reduce borrowings by $61.5 million, or 8.8%. We continue to utilize our leveraging strategy, where designated short-term FHLB borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income, as well as the required purchase of additional FHLB stock which generates increased dividend income; however, we have reduced the amount of assets purchased and liabilities assumed as part of the leveraging strategy during the past year and expect to continue reducing these amounts commensurate with anticipated organic loan growth.\nCash, cash equivalents, and commercial paper. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, to $70.7 million at June 30, 2018 from $87.0 million at June 30, 2017. In conjunction with our leveraging strategy, we purchase commercial paper to take advantage of higher returns with relatively low risk while remaining highly liquid. The commercial paper balance increased $79.2 million, or 52.9% to $229.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $149.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nInvestments. Securities available for sale decreased $44.7 million, to $155.0 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $199.7 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, certificates of deposit in other banks totaled $66.9 million compared to $132.3 million at June 30, 2017. All of the certificates of deposit in other banks are fully insured by the FDIC. The Company has reduced its liquidity position in order to fund recent loan growth. We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in market value. We do not believe that there are any other-than-temporary impairments at June 30, 2018; therefore, no impairment losses have been recorded for fiscal 2018. Other investments include FHLB and FRB stock. FHLB stock decreased $2.2 million, to $29.9 million over the last fiscal year as a result of required redemptions of FHLB stock due to reduced FHLB borrowings. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is required to own FRB stock, which totaled $7.3 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, we held in other assets, $5.2 million of equity securities in small business investment companies.\nLoans. Net loans receivable increased $174.4 million, or 7.4%, to $2.5 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2017, primarily due to $170.5 million in net organic loan growth.\nFor fiscal year 2018, the retail loan segment portfolio originations increased to $323.6 million, or 5.9%, from $305.4 million the previous fiscal year. The commercial loan segment portfolio originations increased to $590.5 million, or 9.0%, from $541.5 million the previous fiscal year.\nRetail consumer and commercial loans consist of the following at the dates indicated: Table 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail consumer loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-to-four family\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>664,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HELOCs -

We have hired experienced commercial real estate relationship managers, credit officers, and developed a construction risk management group to better manage construction risk, as part of our efforts to grow the construction portfolio. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and land development lending by concentrating our efforts on smaller one-to-four residential loans to builders known to us and developers of commercial real estate and multifamily properties with proven success in this type of construction. At June 30, 2018, construction and land/lots totaled $65.6 million including $52.8 million of one-to-four family construction loans that will roll over to permanent loans upon completion of the construction period. Undisbursed construction and land/lots loan commitments at June 30, 2018 totaled $58.9 million. Total construction and development loans at June 30, 2018, were $192.1 million, excluding unfunded loan commitments of $209.7 million, of which $74.5 million was for non-residential commercial real estate construction, $64.5 million was for land development, $48.7 million was for speculative construction of single family properties, and $4.8 million was for multi-family construction. Undisbursed construction and development loan commitments at June 30, 2018 included $108.0 million of commercial real estate projects, multi-family residential projects of $12.4 million and $30.5 million for the speculative construction of one- to four-family residential properties.\nAsset Quality. Our overall asset quality metrics continue to demonstrate our commitment to growing and maintaining a loan portfolio with a moderate risk profile. Nonperforming assets decreased 27.0% to $14.6 million, or 0.44% of total assets, at June 30, 2018, compared to $20.0 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at June 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets included $10.9 million in nonaccruing loans and $3.7 million in REO at June 30, 2018, compared to $13.7 million and $6.3 million, in nonaccruing loans and REO, respectively, at June 30, 2017. Included in nonperforming loans are $4.2 million of loans restructured from their original terms of which $2.6 million were current with respect to their modified payment terms. The decrease in nonaccruing loans was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality throughout the loan portfolio and loans returning to performing status as payment history and the borrower's financial status improved. At June 30, 2018, $5.6 million, or 51.6%, of nonaccruing loans were current on their required loan payments. Purchased impaired loans aggregating $3.4 million acquired from prior acquisitions are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 0.43% at June 30, 2018 from 0.58% at June 30, 2017.\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to 1.00% at June 30, 2018 from 1.57% at June 30, 2017. Classified assets decreased 34.2% to $33.1 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $50.2 million at June 30, 2017. Delinquent loans (loans delinquent 30 days or more) at June 30, 2018 were $9.8 million, or 0.4% of total loans compared to $15.2 million, or 0.6% of total loans at June 30, 2017.\nAs of June 30, 2018, impaired loans decreased to $31.4 million from $39.0 million at June 30, 2017. Our impaired loans are comprised of loans on non-accrual status and all TDRs, whether performing or on non-accrual status under their restructured terms. Impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or on a collective basis as part of homogeneous pools. For more information on these impaired loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for loan losses. We establish an allowance for loan losses by charging amounts to the loan provision at a level required to reflect estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loans losses, management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and current risk factors specifically related to each loan\ntype. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\" for a description of the manner in which the provision for loan losses is established.\nOur allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2018 was $21.1 million, or 0.83% of total loans, compared to $21.2 million, or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 0.91% of gross loans at June 30, 2018, excluding acquired loans from the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, as compared to 1.03% at June 30, 2017. The Company recorded these loans at fair value, which includes a credit discount, therefore, no allowance for loan losses is established for these loans at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent deterioration in credit quality will result in a provision for loan losses. The allowance for our acquired loans at June 30, 2018 was $483,000 compared to $727,000 at June 30, 2017. There was no provision for loan losses for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 as the allowance for loan losses required by our loan growth was offset by continued improvements in our asset quality. Net loan charge-offs decreased to $91,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $141,000 for fiscal 2017. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.00% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 0.01% for last fiscal year. The allowance as a percentage of nonaccruing loans increased to 192.96% at June 30, 2018, compared to 154.77% a year earlier.\nWe believe that the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2018 was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nReal estate owned. REO decreased $2.6 million, to $3.7 million at June 30, 2018 primarily due to $3.9 million in sales of REO, which were partially offset by $1.3 million in transfers from foreclosed loans. The total balance of REO included $1.7 million in commercial real estate, $998,000 in single-family homes and $956,000 in land, construction and development projects (both residential and commercial) at June 30, 2018.\nDeferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes decreased $24.8 million, or 43.3%, to $32.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $57.4 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017, the realization of net operating losses through increases in taxable income, and to a lesser extent, the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets, as discussed below. For more information on the Tax Act's impact on the Company's deferred income taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased $147.8 million, or 7.2%, to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2018 from $2.0 billion at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $93.8 million increase in our core deposits, in particular a $108.1 million or 19.0% increase in money market accounts, from marketing initiatives and a $54.0 million increase in certificates of deposit, which related to additional brokered deposits. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.9 million and $16.8 million in brokered deposits, respectively.\nBorrowings. Borrowings, comprised of FHLB advances, decreased to $635.0 million at June 30, 2018 from $696.5 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018 there were $255.0 million in FHLB advances with maturities less than 90 days and $150.0 million in convertible FHLB advances with maturities greater than one year; together with a weighted average interest rate of 1.95%.\nEquity. Stockholders' equity at June 30, 2018 increased to $409.2 million from $397.6 million at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $8.2 million in net income, $3.0 million in stock-based compensation, and $680,000 in a cumulative adjustment for the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in other comprehensive income representing unrealized losses on investment securities, net of tax. Tangible book value per share increased $0.59, or 3.0% to $19.96 as of June 30, 2018 compared to $19.37 at June 30, 2017.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth the average balance sheets, interest income and expense, and average yields and costs. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

30, 2017\nGeneral. During 2018, we had net income of $8.2 million, a $3.6 million or 30.5% decrease compared to net income of $11.8 million earned in 2017. The Company's diluted earnings per share was $0.44 for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to $0.65 for the year ended June 30, 2017. Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2018 included a $17.9 million write-down of deferred tax assets following a deferred tax revaluation resulting from enactment of the Tax Act with no comparable charge in fiscal year 2017, which was partially offset by the absence of merger-related expenses, which totaled $7.8 million in fiscal year 2017.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018 and before the write-down of deferred tax assets from the change in the federal tax rate, merger-related expenses, certain state income tax expenses, and gains from the sale of premises and equipment (non-GAAP) net income was $25.9 million, or $1.38 in diluted earnings per share compared to $17.1 million, or $0.94 in diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2018 was $100.6 million, a $9.4 million, or 10.4% increase from $91.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflects a $17.3 million increase in interest and dividend income due primarily to an increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in interest expense.\nDuring 2018, average interest-earning assets increased $292.3 million, or 10.9% to $3.0 billion compared to $2.7 billion for 2017. The $338.5 million, or 16.3% increase in average balance of total loans receivable for the year ended June 30, 2018 was due to a full year's impact of the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth. This increase was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $46.2 million, or 7.6% in all other average interest-earning assets, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $152.2 million, or 9.2%, and an $80.4 million, or 13.9% increase in average borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased six basis points to 3.43% from 3.49% for last year. For the year ended June 30, 2018, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $4.1 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.90%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 1.39%, resulting in approximately $1.1 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.14% during fiscal year 2017, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the tax equivalent net interest margin would be 3.66% and 3.88% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2018 was $116.7 million, compared to $99.4 million for 2017, an increase of $17.3 million, or 17.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a $15.0 million, or 16.7% increase in loan interest income, a $2.2 million, or 59.4% increase in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits, and a $354,000, or 21.3% increase in other investment income partially offset by a $315,000, or 7.9% decrease in interest income from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $6.1 million for fiscal year 2017, resulting from the full repayments of several loans with large discounts in the previous year. This decrease caused average loan yields to decrease three basis points to 4.41% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 4.44% in fiscal 2017. The accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year. Excluding the effects of the accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans, loan yields increased 13 basis points to 4.28% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 4.15% in fiscal 2017.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $16.1 million in 2018, a $7.8 million, or 94.9% increase from $8.2 million in 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increase in average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings coupled with the increased cost of nine and 78 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The overall cost of funds increased 28 basis points to 0.65% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 0.37% in the last fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the target federal funds rate on the cost of our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2018 and 2017, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nSee \"Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2018 and 2017 - Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\" for additional details.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $19.7 million for 2018 compared to $16.1 million for 2017. The $3.6 million, or 22.1% increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million, or 14.2% increase in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the increase in deposit accounts and related fees; a $1.8 million, or 49.6% increase in loan income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans and various commercial loan-related fees driven by the commencing of originations and sales of the guaranteed portion of U.S Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) commercial loans; and an $879,000, or 38.9% increase in other noninterest income mainly from investments in small business investment companies. Partially offsetting these increases was a $221,000, or 57.4% decrease in gains from the sale of premises and equipment for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last fiscal year.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $85.3 million in 2018, a $4.9 million, or 5.5% decrease from $90.3 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the previously mentioned $7.8 million of merger-related expenses; a $192,000, or 11.5% decrease in marketing and advertising; a $210,000, or 3.2% decrease in computer services; and a $222,000, or 15.7% decrease in real estate owned (\"REO\") related expenses primarily as a result of fewer REO properties held. Partially offsetting these decreases were the additional expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition, a new commercial loan production office in Greensboro, NC, new SBA and equipment finance lines of business, and the opening of a de novo branch in Cary, NC as shown in the cumulative increase of $3.4 million, or 5.0% in salaries and employee benefits; net occupancy expense; telephone, postage, and supplies; and other expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last year. Deposit insurance premiums increased $241,000, or 17.5% as the net asset base has increased.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $26.7 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.2 million in 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the Tax Act's reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, which required the Company to revalue net deferred tax assets and establish the tax valuation allowance on a portion of our alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credits in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidelines, resulting in a $17.9 million adjustment through income tax expense; and to a lesser extent higher pre-tax income. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had a benefit of $142,000 as compared to a charge of $490,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 related to the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets. In addition, our June 30 fiscal year end required the use of a blended federal income tax rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The blended federal income tax rate of 27.5% was retroactively effective July 1, 2017 and was used for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. For more information on income taxes and deferred taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operation for the Year Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. During 2017, we had net income of $11.8 million, a $391,000 or 3.4% increase compared to net income of $11.5 million earned in 2016. The Company's diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for both years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The leading factors in the increase of net income for both periods ended June 30, 2017 were an increase in net interest income from organic loan growth and the acquisition of TriSummit, which outpaced all merger-related expenses. The Company's earnings per share were impacted by the issuance of 765,277 new common shares in conjunction with the TriSummit acquisition on January 1, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2017 was $91.2 million, a $9.5 million, or 11.6% increase from $81.7 million in 2016. During 2017, average interest-earning assets increased $187.5 million, or 7.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.5 billion for 2016. The $316.3 million, or 17.9% increase in average balance of loan receivables for 2017 was due to the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth, which was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $128.8 million, or 17.6% in average interest-earning deposits with banks, securities available for sale, and other interest-earning assets and an increase in average FHLB borrowings of $95.3 million, or 19.7%.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for 2017 increased 12 basis points to 3.49% from 3.37% for last year. During 2017, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest income at an average yield of 1.14%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.3 million in interest income at an average yield of 0.81% during 2016, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.31%, resulting in approximately $2.0 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased five basis points to 3.88% for 2017 compared to 3.93% for 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2017 was $99.4 million, compared to $87.7 million for 2016, an increase of $11.7 million, or 13.3%.The increase was primarily driven by an $11.6 million, or 14.8% increase in loan interest income and a $196,000, or 13.4% increase in other investment income, which were partially offset by a $178,000, or 4.3% decrease in interest from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and a $1.6 million increase in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $6.1 million for 2017 from $4.5 million for 2016, as a result of early prepayments. Net interest margin is enhanced by the amortization of purchase accounting discounts on purchased loans and certificates of deposit received in recent acquisitions, which is accreted into net interest income. This additional income stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year.\nAverage loan yields decreased 15 basis points to 4.44% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.59% in fiscal 2016. For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the average loan yields included 29 and 26 basis points, respectively, from the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2017, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $633.8 million or 27.0% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $192.6 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $148.0 million, or 76.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $8.2 million in 2017, a $2.2 million, or 36.5% increase from $6.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings increasing interest expense on borrowings by $2.1 million to $3.7 million for 2017 as compared to $1.5 million in 2016. In addition, average borrowings increased by $95.3 million to $577.8 million to partially fund the increase in total loans and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. The TriSummit acquisition was the leading factor for the $298.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The overall average cost of funds increased eight basis points to 0.37% for 2017 compared to 0.29% for 2016 primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the federal funds rate on our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2017 and 2016, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $16.1 million for 2017 compared to $14.3 million for 2016. The $1.8 million, or 12.7% increase was primarily due to a $576,000, or 18.8% increase in loan income and fees from increases in originations of mortgage loans held for sale, a $445,000, or 27.1% increase in BOLI income, and a $385,000 gain on the sale of a previously closed branch office building. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts increased $362,000, or 5.4%, reflecting the increase in deposit accounts from the TriSummit acquisition.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $90.3 million in 2017, a $10.6 million, or 13.3% increase from $79.6 million in 2016. The overall increase was primarily due to $7.8 million of merger-related expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3% as a result of the TriSummit acquisition and an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by the increase in the Company's stock price. As a result of management's continued commitment to reduce operating expenses and the\nconsolidation of six branches during the second quarter of 2016, there was a cumulative decrease of $773,000, or 5.4% in net occupancy expense; marketing and advertising; and telephone, postage, and supplies. This decrease was offset by an $837,000, or 14.4% increase in computer services as a result of the TriSummit acquisition. In addition, deposit insurance premiums decreased $607,000, or 30.6% due to a decline in the rates charged by the FDIC that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. REO-related expenses decreased $385,000 as a result of a $234,000 decrease in writedowns and net losses on the sale of REO properties and a $151,000 decrease in REO expenses.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $5.2 million for fiscal 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 30.5%, as compared to $4.9 million and an effective tax rate of 30.0% in 2016, as a result of higher income before taxes. During 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred a charge of $490,000 and $526,000, respectively, which related to the decrease in value of our deferred tax assets based on recent decreases in North Carolina's corporate tax rate. The rate was reduced to 4.0% in August 2015 and to 3.0% in August 2016 once certain state revenue triggers were achieved.\nAsset/Liability Management\nOur Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. If interest rates rise, our net interest income could be reduced because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings, could increase more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, including loans and other investments. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income because they may reduce the demand for loans.\nHow We Measure Our Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of our process to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we monitor our interest rate risk. In monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on market conditions, their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities, their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates, and interest rate sensitivities of the Company's non-maturity deposits with respect to interest rates paid and the level of balances. The board of directors sets the asset and liability policy of HomeTrust Bank, which is implemented by management and an asset/liability committee whose members include certain members of senior management.\nThe purpose of this committee is to communicate, coordinate and control asset/liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk, and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital position, anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly.\nAmong the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are: (i) increasing our portfolio of hybrid and adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential loans and commercial loans; (ii) maintaining a strong capital position, which provides for a favorable level of interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities; and (iii) emphasizing less interest rate sensitive and lower-costing core deposits.\u201d We also maintain a portfolio of short-term or adjustable-rate assets and use fixed-rate FHLB advances and brokered deposits to extend the term to repricing of our liabilities.\nWe consider the relatively short duration of our deposits in our overall asset/liability management process. As short-term rates increase, we have assets and liabilities that increase with the market. This is reflected in the change in our present value equity ( PVE\u201d) when rates increase (see the table below). PVE is defined as the net present value of our existing assets and liabilities. In addition, we have historically demonstrated an ability to maintain retail deposits through various interest rate cycles. If local retail deposit rates increase dramatically, we also have access to wholesale funding through our lines of credit with the FHLB and FRB, as well as through the brokered deposit market to replace retail deposits, as needed.\nDepending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the committee may in the future determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin. In particular, we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our assets and liabilities portfolios can, during periods of stable or declining interest rates, provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. As a result of this philosophy, our results of operations and the economic value of our equity will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to declines due to differences between long- and short-term interest rates.\nThe committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and our PVE. The committee also valuates these impacts against the potential changes in net interest income and market value of our portfolio equity that are monitored by the board of directors of HomeTrust Bank generally on a quarterly basis.\nOur asset/liability management strategy sets limits on the change in PVE given certain changes in interest rates. The table presented here, as of June 30, 2018, is forward-looking information about our sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The table incorporates data from an independent\nservice, as it relates to maturity repricing and repayment/withdrawal of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk is measured by changes in PVE for instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 400 basis points. Given the current targeted federal funds rate is 1.75% to 2.00% making an immediate change of -200 and -300 basis points improbable, a PVE calculation for a decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. An increase in rates would slightly increase our PVE because the repricing of nonmaturing deposits tend to lag behind the increase in market rates. This positive impact is partially offset by the negative effect from our loans with interest rate floors which will not adjust until such time as a loan's current interest rate adjusts to an increase in market rates which exceeds the interest rate floor. Conversely, in a falling interest rate environment these interest rate floors will assist in maintaining our net interest income. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%, $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Interest Rates in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Present Value Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PVE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>- 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,839\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn evaluating our exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all of these factors in monitoring our exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe board of directors and management of HomeTrust Bank believe that certain factors afford HomeTrust Bank the ability to operate successfully despite its exposure to interest rate risk. HomeTrust Bank may manage its interest rate risk by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in its portfolio, by borrowing from the FHLB to match the duration of our funding to the duration of originated fixed rate one-to-four family and commercial loans held in portfolio and by selling on an ongoing basis certain currently originated longer term fixed rate one-to-four family real estate loans.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio.\nIn addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bank had an additional borrowing capacity of $79.3 million with the FHLB of Atlanta, a $132.3 million line of credit with the FRB, and three lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $60.0 million. At June 30, 2018, we had $635.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Additionally, the Company classifies its securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our security portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. In addition, we have historically sold fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At June 30, 2018, brokered deposits totaled $108.9 million or 4.96% of total deposits.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities. The Company on a stand-alone level is a separate legal entity from HomeTrust\nBank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses. The Company's primary source of funds consists of the net proceeds retained by the Company from the Conversion. We also have the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from HomeTrust Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of HomeTrust Bank to pay dividends. At June 30, 2018, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $23.0 million.\nWe use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At June 30, 2018, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to $259.7 million and $491.6 million, respectively, as compared to $202.1 million and $414.4 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2017. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at June 30, 2018, totaled $385.7 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with us.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, from $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 to $70.7 million as of June 30, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities of $31.3 million and financing activities of $86.4 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $134.0 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2018 included proceeds from maturities of investment securities of $20.7 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $65.3 million, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $20.5 million, and a $147.8 million increase in net deposits. Primary uses of cash during the period included an increase in portfolio loans of $168.6 million, a $3.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases, a decrease in borrowings of $61.5 million, and the purchase of commercial paper, net of maturities, of $75.2 million. All sources and uses of cash reflect our cash management strategy to increase our amount of higher yielding investments and loans, reducing our holdings in lower yielding investments and increasing our lower costing deposits.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased $34.4 million, or 65.4%, from $52.6 million as of June 30, 2016 to $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in borrowings to partially fund the increase in total loans, and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. Cash provided by operating activities of $15.1 million and financing activities of $126.0 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $106.8 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2017 included proceeds from an increase in borrowings of $158.0 million, maturities and sales of investment securities of $46.4 million, maturities of commercial paper, net of purchases, of $81.0 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $29.5 million, and principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $23.9 million. Primary uses of cash during the period included, the purchase of securities available for sale of $15.1 million, a $34.5 million decrease in net deposits, an increase in portfolio loans of $255.9 million, a $2.8 million increase in fixed asset purchases, and $10.6 million for the TriSummit acquisition, net of cash received.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the Company's significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nIn the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the year ended June 30, 2018, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA summary of our off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at June 30, 2018, is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undisbursed portion of construction loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to make loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nAt June 30, 2018, equity totaled $409.2 million. Management monitors the capital levels of the Company to provide for current and future business opportunities and to ensure HomeTrust Bank meets regulatory guidelines for well-capitalized\u201d institutions.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d). As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in the same manner to those applicable to bank holding companies.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank are required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.'s and the Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. At June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nConsistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a well-capitalized\u201d status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. As of June 30, 2018, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 11.70%, 11.70%, 12.45%, and 10.33%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 11.68%, 11.68%, 12.50%, and 9.97%, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 12.97%, 12.97%, 13.72%, and 11.45%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 13.07%, 13.07%, 13.89%, and 11.13%, respectively.\nSee Item 1, Business-How We are Regulated,\u201d and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on the Company's capital requirements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of noninterest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits, and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. Our management is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on the Company's capital requirements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding us as provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences, including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans, equipment finance leases, indirect automobile loans, and municipal leases. We also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, as well as, commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities.\nWe are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as, government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles.\nOur primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, and gains and losses from sales of securities.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses which is required to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, expenses for occupancy, marketing and computer services, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our geographic footprint into seven additional markets through strategic acquisitions as well as three de novo commercial loan offices. Looking forward, we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nAt June 30, 2018, we had 43 locations in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro/\"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley).\nRecent Merger, Acquisition, and Consolidation Activity\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company opened a de novo branch office in Cary, North Carolina.\nOn August 1, 2017, the Company opened a commercial loan production office in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nOn January 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of TriSummit Bancorp, Inc. (\"TriSummit\") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 20, 2016, under which TriSummit merged with and into HomeTrust with HomeTrust as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, TriSummit's wholly owned subsidiary bank, TriSummit Bank, merged with and into the Bank. TriSummit had seven offices throughout the East Tennessee market. The acquisition added approximately $258.0 million in loans and $280.0 million in deposits.\nOn December 31, 2016, the Bank acquired United Financial of North Carolina, Inc. (\"United Financial\"), a municipal lease company headquartered in Fletcher, North Carolina that specializes in providing financing for fire departments and municipalities for the purchase of fire trucks and related equipment as well as the construction of fire stations and other municipal buildings across the Carolinas and other southeastern states. United Financial underwrites and originates these municipal leases and then sells them to HomeTrust and other financial institutions. Beginning January 1, 2017, United Financial has conducted business under the name United Financial, a division of HomeTrust Bank.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Bank consolidated six branch offices located in North Carolina and Tennessee. The closures were the result of a review of customer banking preferences and the current branch network. The Company had a nonrecurring impairment charge of $400,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 in relation to the consolidation of these offices.\nBusiness and Operating Strategy and Goals\nOur primary objective is to continue to operate and grow HomeTrust Bank as a well-capitalized, profitable, independent, community banking organization. Our mission is to create stockholder value by building relationships with our employees, customers, and communities in our primary markets in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro / \"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley) through exceptional service and helping our customers every day to be \"Ready For What's Next\" in their financial lives. We will also need to continue providing our employees with the tools necessary to effectively deliver our products and services to customers in order to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in our market areas and to fulfill our \"Commitment to the Customer Experience.\"\nContinuing to originate residential and commercial real estate loans and municipal leases. Our primary lending focus has been, and will continue to be, on operating as a residential and commercial mortgage lender. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate residential and commercial mortgage loans. Most of the long term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary market with servicing released, while most of the residential adjustable rate mortgages and fixed rate mortgages with terms to maturity of 15 years or less, all commercial real estate loans, and all municipal leases that we originate, are retained in our portfolio. We intend to continue to emphasize these lending activities particularly in the larger attractive markets we have added in the past several years.\nExpanding our lines of businesses. In our commitment to sound and profitable organic growth, we continuously focus on enhancing our lines of businesses. During fiscal year 2018, we added 13 additional commercial market presidents/relationship managers primarily throughout our seven metro markets to further expand our commercial and industrial lending, as well as our knowledge of the growing markets. During fiscal 2018, we implemented a new loan decision platform and overhauled our home equity lines of credit (\"HELOCs\") origination process resulting in 75% increase in branch originations and a 68% decrease in the amount of time to close the loan. Commercial loan originations for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016 were $590.5 million, $532.5 million, and $325.5 million, respectively. Fiscal year 2018 marked the fourth full year of our indirect auto finance line of business, which serves automobile dealerships, its owners, and consumers buying automobiles from these dealerships throughout western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Our focus on working with strong dealerships affords us the opportunity to expand into additional market areas and to actively deepen relationships through cross-selling opportunities, while building a strong reputation. Indirect auto loans grew to $173.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $140.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nBuilding on the momentum we have generated, we opened a de novo branch in Cary, North Carolina in March 2018 and a new Commercial LPO in Greensboro, North Carolina in August 2017. In addition, we began operations for our new SBA 7(a) loan program and equipment finance line of business. As we look forward, we will continue to focus on organic loan growth through both established and new lines of business as well as refocusing on business banking and consumer lending through branches.\nDisciplined franchise expansion. We believe opportunities currently exist within our new market areas to grow our franchise as illustrated by 84% of our commercial loan originations in fiscal year 2018 were originated by commercial relationship managers located in market areas we entered subsequent to 2012. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nMaintaining and improving asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.43% and 0.58% for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets at June 30, 2018 was 0.44% compared to 0.62% at June 30, 2017. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, an increased emphasis on a borrower's ongoing ability to repay a loan by requiring lower debt to income ratios, higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios than our previous lending policies had required. Although the Company intends to grow the commercial loan portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, the Company intends to manage credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers in this area, internal concentration limits, and a conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to manage the funding costs of our loan growth. We offer personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. To build our core deposit base, over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through a recently expanded product line tailored to our target business customers' needs. We are also pursuing a number of strategies that include enhancing our online and mobile banking platform, including improvements to online account opening and sales promotions on money market and checking accounts to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits. As a result, core deposits (which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts) have increased 6% during fiscal 2018 and were 77% of total deposits at June 30, 2018.\nImproving profitability through customer growth and balance sheet management. We are continuing to focus significant efforts on creating brand awareness, offering competitive products and employing a strong and experienced workforce. In order to deepen the relationships with our customers and increase individual customer profitability, we have continued our cross-marketing program, which allows us to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers when a new account is opened. In addition, we have targeted our direct mail campaigns to take advantage of competitor mergers and/or branch closures to acquire new customer core deposits. We believe these initiatives have positioned us well to implement a strategy focused on improving revenue growth and noninterest income.\nHiring and retaining experienced employees with a customer service focus. We have been successful in attracting and retaining banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of our markets, through both individual hires and business combinations, which is central to our business strategy. Exceptional service, local involvement and timely decision-making are integral parts of our business strategy, and we continue to seek additional highly qualified and motivated individuals. We believe that by focusing on experienced bankers who are established in their communities, we enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities. Our compensation and incentive systems are aligned with our strategies to grow core deposits and our loan portfolio as the economy improves, while improving asset quality. We have a strong corporate culture based on personal accountability and high ethical standards with an emphasis on \"character\" and \"competence\" across all our business lines and locations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nBusiness Combinations and Acquired Loans. We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires us as acquirer to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as, recognize goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase, if appropriate. Any acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred.\nWe account for purchased performing loans acquired in business combinations using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. We record purchased performing loans at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. We do not establish any allowance for loan losses for purchased performing loans, however we will record a provision for loan losses for any further deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nWe consider loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected as purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include the internal loan risk grade, delinquent and nonaccrual status, recent credit scores, and recent loan-to-value percentages. We initially record PCI loans at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Thus, we do not establish any allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date using specific credit reviews of certain loans and quantitative models incorporating credit risk, prepayment assumptions, and various other factors. These estimates require significant judgment given the impact of real estate prices, changing loss estimates, prepayment assumptions, and other relevant factors. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date, considering the impact of prepayments, is the nonaccretable difference and is available to absorb future loan chargeoffs.\nReal Estate Owned ( REO\u201d). REO represents real estate acquired as a result of customers' loan defaults. At the time of foreclosure, REO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell, which becomes the property's new basis. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent valuation adjustments to the carrying amount of the property are included in noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income. In some instances, we may make loans to facilitate the sales of REO. Management reviews all sales for which it is the lending institution for compliance with sales treatment under provisions established by Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 360, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.\u201d Any gains related to sales of REO may be deferred until the buyer has a sufficient initial and continuing investment in the property.\nGoodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to assess either qualitative or quantitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference, but limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Other identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include: efficiency ratio; tangible book value per share; tangible equity to tangible assets ratio; net interest income and net interest margin as adjusted to exclude additional Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings and proceeds from such borrowings; net income, earnings per share (\"EPS\"), return on assets (\"ROA\"), and return on equity (\"ROE\") excluding merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, adjustments for the change in federal tax law, and gain from the sale of premises and equipment; and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans excluding acquired loans.\nManagement elected to utilize short-term FHLB borrowings beginning in November 2014 as part of a leverage strategy to increase net interest income. The Company believes that showing the effects of these borrowings on net interest income and net interest margin is useful to both management and investors as these measures are commonly used to measure financial institution's performance and against peers.\nThe Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital and earnings ability over time and in comparison to its competitors. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total stockholders' equity or operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of our efficiency ratio:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>

Total assets increased $97.6 million, or 3.0% to $3.3 billion at June 30, 2018 from $3.2 billion at June 30, 2017. Total liabilities increased $86.0 million, or 3.1% to $2.9 billion at June 30, 2018 from $2.8 billion at June 30, 2017. Deposit growth of $147.8 million, or 7.2% and the cumulative decrease of $126.3 million, or 30.1% in cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit in other banks and investment securities during the year ended June 30, 2018 were used to partially fund the $174.4 million, or 7.4% increase in total loans receivable, the $79.2 million, or 52.9% increase in commercial paper, and reduce borrowings by $61.5 million, or 8.8%. We continue to utilize our leveraging strategy, where designated short-term FHLB borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income, as well as the required purchase of additional FHLB stock which generates increased dividend income; however, we have reduced the amount of assets purchased and liabilities assumed as part of the leveraging strategy during the past year and expect to continue reducing these amounts commensurate with anticipated organic loan growth.\nCash, cash equivalents, and commercial paper. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, to $70.7 million at June 30, 2018 from $87.0 million at June 30, 2017. In conjunction with our leveraging strategy, we purchase commercial paper to take advantage of higher returns with relatively low risk while remaining highly liquid. The commercial paper balance increased $79.2 million, or 52.9% to $229.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $149.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nInvestments. Securities available for sale decreased $44.7 million, to $155.0 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $199.7 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, certificates of deposit in other banks totaled $66.9 million compared to $132.3 million at June 30, 2017. All of the certificates of deposit in other banks are fully insured by the FDIC. The Company has reduced its liquidity position in order to fund recent loan growth. We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in market value. We do not believe that there are any other-than-temporary impairments at June 30, 2018; therefore, no impairment losses have been recorded for fiscal 2018. Other investments include FHLB and FRB stock. FHLB stock decreased $2.2 million, to $29.9 million over the last fiscal year as a result of required redemptions of FHLB stock due to reduced FHLB borrowings. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is required to own FRB stock, which totaled $7.3 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, we held in other assets, $5.2 million of equity securities in small business investment companies.\nLoans. Net loans receivable increased $174.4 million, or 7.4%, to $2.5 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2017, primarily due to $170.5 million in net organic loan growth.\nFor fiscal year 2018, the retail loan segment portfolio originations increased to $323.6 million, or 5.9%, from $305.4 million the previous fiscal year. The commercial loan segment portfolio originations increased to $590.5 million, or 9.0%, from $541.5 million the previous fiscal year.\nRetail consumer and commercial loans consist of the following at the dates indicated: Table 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail consumer loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-to-four family\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>664,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>684,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,800\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HELOCs -

We have hired experienced commercial real estate relationship managers, credit officers, and developed a construction risk management group to better manage construction risk, as part of our efforts to grow the construction portfolio. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and land development lending by concentrating our efforts on smaller one-to-four residential loans to builders known to us and developers of commercial real estate and multifamily properties with proven success in this type of construction. At June 30, 2018, construction and land/lots totaled $65.6 million including $52.8 million of one-to-four family construction loans that will roll over to permanent loans upon completion of the construction period. Undisbursed construction and land/lots loan commitments at June 30, 2018 totaled $58.9 million. Total construction and development loans at June 30, 2018, were $192.1 million, excluding unfunded loan commitments of $209.7 million, of which $74.5 million was for non-residential commercial real estate construction, $64.5 million was for land development, $48.7 million was for speculative construction of single family properties, and $4.8 million was for multi-family construction. Undisbursed construction and development loan commitments at June 30, 2018 included $108.0 million of commercial real estate projects, multi-family residential projects of $12.4 million and $30.5 million for the speculative construction of one- to four-family residential properties.\nAsset Quality. Our overall asset quality metrics continue to demonstrate our commitment to growing and maintaining a loan portfolio with a moderate risk profile. Nonperforming assets decreased 27.0% to $14.6 million, or 0.44% of total assets, at June 30, 2018, compared to $20.0 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at June 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets included $10.9 million in nonaccruing loans and $3.7 million in REO at June 30, 2018, compared to $13.7 million and $6.3 million, in nonaccruing loans and REO, respectively, at June 30, 2017. Included in nonperforming loans are $4.2 million of loans restructured from their original terms of which $2.6 million were current with respect to their modified payment terms. The decrease in nonaccruing loans was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality throughout the loan portfolio and loans returning to performing status as payment history and the borrower's financial status improved. At June 30, 2018, $5.6 million, or 51.6%, of nonaccruing loans were current on their required loan payments. Purchased impaired loans aggregating $3.4 million acquired from prior acquisitions are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 0.43% at June 30, 2018 from 0.58% at June 30, 2017.\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to 1.00% at June 30, 2018 from 1.57% at June 30, 2017. Classified assets decreased 34.2% to $33.1 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $50.2 million at June 30, 2017. Delinquent loans (loans delinquent 30 days or more) at June 30, 2018 were $9.8 million, or 0.4% of total loans compared to $15.2 million, or 0.6% of total loans at June 30, 2017.\nAs of June 30, 2018, impaired loans decreased to $31.4 million from $39.0 million at June 30, 2017. Our impaired loans are comprised of loans on non-accrual status and all TDRs, whether performing or on non-accrual status under their restructured terms. Impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or on a collective basis as part of homogeneous pools. For more information on these impaired loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for loan losses. We establish an allowance for loan losses by charging amounts to the loan provision at a level required to reflect estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loans losses, management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and current risk factors specifically related to each loan\ntype. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\" for a description of the manner in which the provision for loan losses is established.\nOur allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2018 was $21.1 million, or 0.83% of total loans, compared to $21.2 million, or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 0.91% of gross loans at June 30, 2018, excluding acquired loans from the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, as compared to 1.03% at June 30, 2017. The Company recorded these loans at fair value, which includes a credit discount, therefore, no allowance for loan losses is established for these loans at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent deterioration in credit quality will result in a provision for loan losses. The allowance for our acquired loans at June 30, 2018 was $483,000 compared to $727,000 at June 30, 2017. There was no provision for loan losses for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 as the allowance for loan losses required by our loan growth was offset by continued improvements in our asset quality. Net loan charge-offs decreased to $91,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $141,000 for fiscal 2017. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.00% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 0.01% for last fiscal year. The allowance as a percentage of nonaccruing loans increased to 192.96% at June 30, 2018, compared to 154.77% a year earlier.\nWe believe that the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2018 was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nReal estate owned. REO decreased $2.6 million, to $3.7 million at June 30, 2018 primarily due to $3.9 million in sales of REO, which were partially offset by $1.3 million in transfers from foreclosed loans. The total balance of REO included $1.7 million in commercial real estate, $998,000 in single-family homes and $956,000 in land, construction and development projects (both residential and commercial) at June 30, 2018.\nDeferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes decreased $24.8 million, or 43.3%, to $32.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $57.4 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017, the realization of net operating losses through increases in taxable income, and to a lesser extent, the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets, as discussed below. For more information on the Tax Act's impact on the Company's deferred income taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased $147.8 million, or 7.2%, to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2018 from $2.0 billion at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $93.8 million increase in our core deposits, in particular a $108.1 million or 19.0% increase in money market accounts, from marketing initiatives and a $54.0 million increase in certificates of deposit, which related to additional brokered deposits. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.9 million and $16.8 million in brokered deposits, respectively.\nBorrowings. Borrowings, comprised of FHLB advances, decreased to $635.0 million at June 30, 2018 from $696.5 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018 there were $255.0 million in FHLB advances with maturities less than 90 days and $150.0 million in convertible FHLB advances with maturities greater than one year; together with a weighted average interest rate of 1.95%.\nEquity. Stockholders' equity at June 30, 2018 increased to $409.2 million from $397.6 million at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $8.2 million in net income, $3.0 million in stock-based compensation, and $680,000 in a cumulative adjustment for the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in other comprehensive income representing unrealized losses on investment securities, net of tax. Tangible book value per share increased $0.59, or 3.0% to $19.96 as of June 30, 2018 compared to $19.37 at June 30, 2017.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth the average balance sheets, interest income and expense, and average yields and costs. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

30, 2017\nGeneral. During 2018, we had net income of $8.2 million, a $3.6 million or 30.5% decrease compared to net income of $11.8 million earned in 2017. The Company's diluted earnings per share was $0.44 for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to $0.65 for the year ended June 30, 2017. Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2018 included a $17.9 million write-down of deferred tax assets following a deferred tax revaluation resulting from enactment of the Tax Act with no comparable charge in fiscal year 2017, which was partially offset by the absence of merger-related expenses, which totaled $7.8 million in fiscal year 2017.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018 and before the write-down of deferred tax assets from the change in the federal tax rate, merger-related expenses, certain state income tax expenses, and gains from the sale of premises and equipment (non-GAAP) net income was $25.9 million, or $1.38 in diluted earnings per share compared to $17.1 million, or $0.94 in diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2018 was $100.6 million, a $9.4 million, or 10.4% increase from $91.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflects a $17.3 million increase in interest and dividend income due primarily to an increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in interest expense.\nDuring 2018, average interest-earning assets increased $292.3 million, or 10.9% to $3.0 billion compared to $2.7 billion for 2017. The $338.5 million, or 16.3% increase in average balance of total loans receivable for the year ended June 30, 2018 was due to a full year's impact of the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth. This increase was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $46.2 million, or 7.6% in all other average interest-earning assets, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $152.2 million, or 9.2%, and an $80.4 million, or 13.9% increase in average borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased six basis points to 3.43% from 3.49% for last year. For the year ended June 30, 2018, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $4.1 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.90%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 1.39%, resulting in approximately $1.1 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.14% during fiscal year 2017, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the tax equivalent net interest margin would be 3.66% and 3.88% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2018 was $116.7 million, compared to $99.4 million for 2017, an increase of $17.3 million, or 17.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a $15.0 million, or 16.7% increase in loan interest income, a $2.2 million, or 59.4% increase in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits, and a $354,000, or 21.3% increase in other investment income partially offset by a $315,000, or 7.9% decrease in interest income from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $6.1 million for fiscal year 2017, resulting from the full repayments of several loans with large discounts in the previous year. This decrease caused average loan yields to decrease three basis points to 4.41% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 4.44% in fiscal 2017. The accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year. Excluding the effects of the accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans, loan yields increased 13 basis points to 4.28% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 4.15% in fiscal 2017.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $16.1 million in 2018, a $7.8 million, or 94.9% increase from $8.2 million in 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increase in average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings coupled with the increased cost of nine and 78 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The overall cost of funds increased 28 basis points to 0.65% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 0.37% in the last fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the target federal funds rate on the cost of our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2018 and 2017, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nSee \"Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2018 and 2017 - Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\" for additional details.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $19.7 million for 2018 compared to $16.1 million for 2017. The $3.6 million, or 22.1% increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million, or 14.2% increase in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the increase in deposit accounts and related fees; a $1.8 million, or 49.6% increase in loan income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans and various commercial loan-related fees driven by the commencing of originations and sales of the guaranteed portion of U.S Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) commercial loans; and an $879,000, or 38.9% increase in other noninterest income mainly from investments in small business investment companies. Partially offsetting these increases was a $221,000, or 57.4% decrease in gains from the sale of premises and equipment for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last fiscal year.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $85.3 million in 2018, a $4.9 million, or 5.5% decrease from $90.3 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the previously mentioned $7.8 million of merger-related expenses; a $192,000, or 11.5% decrease in marketing and advertising; a $210,000, or 3.2% decrease in computer services; and a $222,000, or 15.7% decrease in real estate owned (\"REO\") related expenses primarily as a result of fewer REO properties held. Partially offsetting these decreases were the additional expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition, a new commercial loan production office in Greensboro, NC, new SBA and equipment finance lines of business, and the opening of a de novo branch in Cary, NC as shown in the cumulative increase of $3.4 million, or 5.0% in salaries and employee benefits; net occupancy expense; telephone, postage, and supplies; and other expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last year. Deposit insurance premiums increased $241,000, or 17.5% as the net asset base has increased.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $26.7 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.2 million in 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the Tax Act's reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, which required the Company to revalue net deferred tax assets and establish the tax valuation allowance on a portion of our alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credits in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidelines, resulting in a $17.9 million adjustment through income tax expense; and to a lesser extent higher pre-tax income. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had a benefit of $142,000 as compared to a charge of $490,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 related to the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets. In addition, our June 30 fiscal year end required the use of a blended federal income tax rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The blended federal income tax rate of 27.5% was retroactively effective July 1, 2017 and was used for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. For more information on income taxes and deferred taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operation for the Year Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. During 2017, we had net income of $11.8 million, a $391,000 or 3.4% increase compared to net income of $11.5 million earned in 2016. The Company's diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for both years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The leading factors in the increase of net income for both periods ended June 30, 2017 were an increase in net interest income from organic loan growth and the acquisition of TriSummit, which outpaced all merger-related expenses. The Company's earnings per share were impacted by the issuance of 765,277 new common shares in conjunction with the TriSummit acquisition on January 1, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2017 was $91.2 million, a $9.5 million, or 11.6% increase from $81.7 million in 2016. During 2017, average interest-earning assets increased $187.5 million, or 7.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.5 billion for 2016. The $316.3 million, or 17.9% increase in average balance of loan receivables for 2017 was due to the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth, which was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $128.8 million, or 17.6% in average interest-earning deposits with banks, securities available for sale, and other interest-earning assets and an increase in average FHLB borrowings of $95.3 million, or 19.7%.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for 2017 increased 12 basis points to 3.49% from 3.37% for last year. During 2017, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest income at an average yield of 1.14%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.3 million in interest income at an average yield of 0.81% during 2016, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.31%, resulting in approximately $2.0 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased five basis points to 3.88% for 2017 compared to 3.93% for 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2017 was $99.4 million, compared to $87.7 million for 2016, an increase of $11.7 million, or 13.3%.The increase was primarily driven by an $11.6 million, or 14.8% increase in loan interest income and a $196,000, or 13.4% increase in other investment income, which were partially offset by a $178,000, or 4.3% decrease in interest from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and a $1.6 million increase in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $6.1 million for 2017 from $4.5 million for 2016, as a result of early prepayments. Net interest margin is enhanced by the amortization of purchase accounting discounts on purchased loans and certificates of deposit received in recent acquisitions, which is accreted into net interest income. This additional income stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year.\nAverage loan yields decreased 15 basis points to 4.44% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.59% in fiscal 2016. For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the average loan yields included 29 and 26 basis points, respectively, from the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2017, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $633.8 million or 27.0% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $192.6 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $148.0 million, or 76.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $8.2 million in 2017, a $2.2 million, or 36.5% increase from $6.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings increasing interest expense on borrowings by $2.1 million to $3.7 million for 2017 as compared to $1.5 million in 2016. In addition, average borrowings increased by $95.3 million to $577.8 million to partially fund the increase in total loans and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. The TriSummit acquisition was the leading factor for the $298.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The overall average cost of funds increased eight basis points to 0.37% for 2017 compared to 0.29% for 2016 primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the federal funds rate on our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2017 and 2016, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $16.1 million for 2017 compared to $14.3 million for 2016. The $1.8 million, or 12.7% increase was primarily due to a $576,000, or 18.8% increase in loan income and fees from increases in originations of mortgage loans held for sale, a $445,000, or 27.1% increase in BOLI income, and a $385,000 gain on the sale of a previously closed branch office building. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts increased $362,000, or 5.4%, reflecting the increase in deposit accounts from the TriSummit acquisition.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $90.3 million in 2017, a $10.6 million, or 13.3% increase from $79.6 million in 2016. The overall increase was primarily due to $7.8 million of merger-related expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3% as a result of the TriSummit acquisition and an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by the increase in the Company's stock price. As a result of management's continued commitment to reduce operating expenses and the\nconsolidation of six branches during the second quarter of 2016, there was a cumulative decrease of $773,000, or 5.4% in net occupancy expense; marketing and advertising; and telephone, postage, and supplies. This decrease was offset by an $837,000, or 14.4% increase in computer services as a result of the TriSummit acquisition. In addition, deposit insurance premiums decreased $607,000, or 30.6% due to a decline in the rates charged by the FDIC that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. REO-related expenses decreased $385,000 as a result of a $234,000 decrease in writedowns and net losses on the sale of REO properties and a $151,000 decrease in REO expenses.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $5.2 million for fiscal 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 30.5%, as compared to $4.9 million and an effective tax rate of 30.0% in 2016, as a result of higher income before taxes. During 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred a charge of $490,000 and $526,000, respectively, which related to the decrease in value of our deferred tax assets based on recent decreases in North Carolina's corporate tax rate. The rate was reduced to 4.0% in August 2015 and to 3.0% in August 2016 once certain state revenue triggers were achieved.\nAsset/Liability Management\nOur Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. If interest rates rise, our net interest income could be reduced because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings, could increase more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, including loans and other investments. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income because they may reduce the demand for loans.\nHow We Measure Our Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of our process to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we monitor our interest rate risk. In monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on market conditions, their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities, their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates, and interest rate sensitivities of the Company's non-maturity deposits with respect to interest rates paid and the level of balances. The board of directors sets the asset and liability policy of HomeTrust Bank, which is implemented by management and an asset/liability committee whose members include certain members of senior management.\nThe purpose of this committee is to communicate, coordinate and control asset/liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk, and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital position, anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly.\nAmong the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are: (i) increasing our portfolio of hybrid and adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential loans and commercial loans; (ii) maintaining a strong capital position, which provides for a favorable level of interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities; and (iii) emphasizing less interest rate sensitive and lower-costing core deposits.\u201d We also maintain a portfolio of short-term or adjustable-rate assets and use fixed-rate FHLB advances and brokered deposits to extend the term to repricing of our liabilities.\nWe consider the relatively short duration of our deposits in our overall asset/liability management process. As short-term rates increase, we have assets and liabilities that increase with the market. This is reflected in the change in our present value equity ( PVE\u201d) when rates increase (see the table below). PVE is defined as the net present value of our existing assets and liabilities. In addition, we have historically demonstrated an ability to maintain retail deposits through various interest rate cycles. If local retail deposit rates increase dramatically, we also have access to wholesale funding through our lines of credit with the FHLB and FRB, as well as through the brokered deposit market to replace retail deposits, as needed.\nDepending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the committee may in the future determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin. In particular, we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our assets and liabilities portfolios can, during periods of stable or declining interest rates, provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. As a result of this philosophy, our results of operations and the economic value of our equity will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to declines due to differences between long- and short-term interest rates.\nThe committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and our PVE. The committee also valuates these impacts against the potential changes in net interest income and market value of our portfolio equity that are monitored by the board of directors of HomeTrust Bank generally on a quarterly basis.\nOur asset/liability management strategy sets limits on the change in PVE given certain changes in interest rates. The table presented here, as of June 30, 2018, is forward-looking information about our sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The table incorporates data from an independent\nservice, as it relates to maturity repricing and repayment/withdrawal of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk is measured by changes in PVE for instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 400 basis points. Given the current targeted federal funds rate is 1.75% to 2.00% making an immediate change of -200 and -300 basis points improbable, a PVE calculation for a decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. An increase in rates would slightly increase our PVE because the repricing of nonmaturing deposits tend to lag behind the increase in market rates. This positive impact is partially offset by the negative effect from our loans with interest rate floors which will not adjust until such time as a loan's current interest rate adjusts to an increase in market rates which exceeds the interest rate floor. Conversely, in a falling interest rate environment these interest rate floors will assist in maintaining our net interest income. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%, $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Interest Rates in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Present Value Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PVE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>738,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+ 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>715,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>- 100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,839\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn evaluating our exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all of these factors in monitoring our exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe board of directors and management of HomeTrust Bank believe that certain factors afford HomeTrust Bank the ability to operate successfully despite its exposure to interest rate risk. HomeTrust Bank may manage its interest rate risk by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in its portfolio, by borrowing from the FHLB to match the duration of our funding to the duration of originated fixed rate one-to-four family and commercial loans held in portfolio and by selling on an ongoing basis certain currently originated longer term fixed rate one-to-four family real estate loans.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio.\nIn addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bank had an additional borrowing capacity of $79.3 million with the FHLB of Atlanta, a $132.3 million line of credit with the FRB, and three lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $60.0 million. At June 30, 2018, we had $635.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Additionally, the Company classifies its securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our security portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. In addition, we have historically sold fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At June 30, 2018, brokered deposits totaled $108.9 million or 4.96% of total deposits.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities. The Company on a stand-alone level is a separate legal entity from HomeTrust\nBank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses. The Company's primary source of funds consists of the net proceeds retained by the Company from the Conversion. We also have the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from HomeTrust Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of HomeTrust Bank to pay dividends. At June 30, 2018, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $23.0 million.\nWe use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At June 30, 2018, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to $259.7 million and $491.6 million, respectively, as compared to $202.1 million and $414.4 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2017. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at June 30, 2018, totaled $385.7 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with us.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, from $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 to $70.7 million as of June 30, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities of $31.3 million and financing activities of $86.4 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $134.0 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2018 included proceeds from maturities of investment securities of $20.7 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $65.3 million, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $20.5 million, and a $147.8 million increase in net deposits. Primary uses of cash during the period included an increase in portfolio loans of $168.6 million, a $3.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases, a decrease in borrowings of $61.5 million, and the purchase of commercial paper, net of maturities, of $75.2 million. All sources and uses of cash reflect our cash management strategy to increase our amount of higher yielding investments and loans, reducing our holdings in lower yielding investments and increasing our lower costing deposits.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased $34.4 million, or 65.4%, from $52.6 million as of June 30, 2016 to $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in borrowings to partially fund the increase in total loans, and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. Cash provided by operating activities of $15.1 million and financing activities of $126.0 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $106.8 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2017 included proceeds from an increase in borrowings of $158.0 million, maturities and sales of investment securities of $46.4 million, maturities of commercial paper, net of purchases, of $81.0 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $29.5 million, and principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $23.9 million. Primary uses of cash during the period included, the purchase of securities available for sale of $15.1 million, a $34.5 million decrease in net deposits, an increase in portfolio loans of $255.9 million, a $2.8 million increase in fixed asset purchases, and $10.6 million for the TriSummit acquisition, net of cash received.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the Company's significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>1 Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>645,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nIn the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the year ended June 30, 2018, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA summary of our off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at June 30, 2018, is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undisbursed portion of construction loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to make loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>759,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nAt June 30, 2018, equity totaled $409.2 million. Management monitors the capital levels of the Company to provide for current and future business opportunities and to ensure HomeTrust Bank meets regulatory guidelines for well-capitalized\u201d institutions.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d). As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in the same manner to those applicable to bank holding companies.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank are required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.'s and the Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. At June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nConsistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a well-capitalized\u201d status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. As of June 30, 2018, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 11.70%, 11.70%, 12.45%, and 10.33%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 11.68%, 11.68%, 12.50%, and 9.97%, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 12.97%, 12.97%, 13.72%, and 11.45%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 13.07%, 13.07%, 13.89%, and 11.13%, respectively.\nSee Item 1, Business-How We are Regulated,\u201d and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on the Company's capital requirements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of noninterest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits, and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. Our management is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on the Company's capital requirements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding us as provided in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences, including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans, equipment finance leases, indirect automobile loans, and municipal leases. We also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, as well as, commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC.\nWe offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities.\nWe are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, as well as, government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles.\nOur primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, and gains and losses from sales of securities.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses which is required to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, expenses for occupancy, marketing and computer services, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our geographic footprint into seven additional markets through strategic acquisitions as well as three de novo commercial loan offices. Looking forward, we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nAt June 30, 2018, we had 43 locations in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro/\"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley).\nRecent Merger, Acquisition, and Consolidation Activity\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company opened a de novo branch office in Cary, North Carolina.\nOn August 1, 2017, the Company opened a commercial loan production office in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nOn January 1, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of TriSummit Bancorp, Inc. (\"TriSummit\") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 20, 2016, under which TriSummit merged with and into HomeTrust with HomeTrust as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, TriSummit's wholly owned subsidiary bank, TriSummit Bank, merged with and into the Bank. TriSummit had seven offices throughout the East Tennessee market. The acquisition added approximately $258.0 million in loans and $280.0 million in deposits.\nOn December 31, 2016, the Bank acquired United Financial of North Carolina, Inc. (\"United Financial\"), a municipal lease company headquartered in Fletcher, North Carolina that specializes in providing financing for fire departments and municipalities for the purchase of fire trucks and related equipment as well as the construction of fire stations and other municipal buildings across the Carolinas and other southeastern states. United Financial underwrites and originates these municipal leases and then sells them to HomeTrust and other financial institutions. Beginning January 1, 2017, United Financial has conducted business under the name United Financial, a division of HomeTrust Bank.\nOn October 30, 2015, the Bank consolidated six branch offices located in North Carolina and Tennessee. The closures were the result of a review of customer banking preferences and the current branch network. The Company had a nonrecurring impairment charge of $400,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 in relation to the consolidation of these offices.\nBusiness and Operating Strategy and Goals\nOur primary objective is to continue to operate and grow HomeTrust Bank as a well-capitalized, profitable, independent, community banking organization. Our mission is to create stockholder value by building relationships with our employees, customers, and communities in our primary markets in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, Greensboro / \"Piedmont\" region, Charlotte, and Raleigh/Cary), Upstate South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City/Bristol, Knoxville, and Morristown) and Southwest Virginia (including the Roanoke Valley) through exceptional service and helping our customers every day to be \"Ready For What's Next\" in their financial lives. We will also need to continue providing our employees with the tools necessary to effectively deliver our products and services to customers in order to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in our market areas and to fulfill our \"Commitment to the Customer Experience.\"\nContinuing to originate residential and commercial real estate loans and municipal leases. Our primary lending focus has been, and will continue to be, on operating as a residential and commercial mortgage lender. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate residential and commercial mortgage loans. Most of the long term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary market with servicing released, while most of the residential adjustable rate mortgages and fixed rate mortgages with terms to maturity of 15 years or less, all commercial real estate loans, and all municipal leases that we originate, are retained in our portfolio. We intend to continue to emphasize these lending activities particularly in the larger attractive markets we have added in the past several years.\nExpanding our lines of businesses. In our commitment to sound and profitable organic growth, we continuously focus on enhancing our lines of businesses. During fiscal year 2018, we added 13 additional commercial market presidents/relationship managers primarily throughout our seven metro markets to further expand our commercial and industrial lending, as well as our knowledge of the growing markets. During fiscal 2018, we implemented a new loan decision platform and overhauled our home equity lines of credit (\"HELOCs\") origination process resulting in 75% increase in branch originations and a 68% decrease in the amount of time to close the loan. Commercial loan originations for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016 were $590.5 million, $532.5 million, and $325.5 million, respectively. Fiscal year 2018 marked the fourth full year of our indirect auto finance line of business, which serves automobile dealerships, its owners, and consumers buying automobiles from these dealerships throughout western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Our focus on working with strong dealerships affords us the opportunity to expand into additional market areas and to actively deepen relationships through cross-selling opportunities, while building a strong reputation. Indirect auto loans grew to $173.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $140.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nBuilding on the momentum we have generated, we opened a de novo branch in Cary, North Carolina in March 2018 and a new Commercial LPO in Greensboro, North Carolina in August 2017. In addition, we began operations for our new SBA 7(a) loan program and equipment finance line of business. As we look forward, we will continue to focus on organic loan growth through both established and new lines of business as well as refocusing on business banking and consumer lending through branches.\nDisciplined franchise expansion. We believe opportunities currently exist within our new market areas to grow our franchise as illustrated by 84% of our commercial loan originations in fiscal year 2018 were originated by commercial relationship managers located in market areas we entered subsequent to 2012. We anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens, through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas. We may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches, loan purchases and, to a lesser degree, whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives. We will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas.\nMaintaining and improving asset quality. The Company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.43% and 0.58% for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets at June 30, 2018 was 0.44% compared to 0.62% at June 30, 2017. The Company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. In the past several years, the Company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans, including, among other things, an increased emphasis on a borrower's ongoing ability to repay a loan by requiring lower debt to income ratios, higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios than our previous lending policies had required. Although the Company intends to grow the commercial loan portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending, the Company intends to manage credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers in this area, internal concentration limits, and a conservative approach to lending.\nEmphasizing lower cost core deposits to manage the funding costs of our loan growth. We offer personal checking, savings and money-market accounts, which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate. To build our core deposit base, over the past several years, we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits. We have utilized additional product offerings, technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal. In addition, we intend to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through a recently expanded product line tailored to our target business customers' needs. We are also pursuing a number of strategies that include enhancing our online and mobile banking platform, including improvements to online account opening and sales promotions on money market and checking accounts to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits. As a result, core deposits (which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts) have increased 6% during fiscal 2018 and were 77% of total deposits at June 30, 2018.\nImproving profitability through customer growth and balance sheet management. We are continuing to focus significant efforts on creating brand awareness, offering competitive products and employing a strong and experienced workforce. In order to deepen the relationships with our customers and increase individual customer profitability, we have continued our cross-marketing program, which allows us to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers when a new account is opened. In addition, we have targeted our direct mail campaigns to take advantage of competitor mergers and/or branch closures to acquire new customer core deposits. We believe these initiatives have positioned us well to implement a strategy focused on improving revenue growth and noninterest income.\nHiring and retaining experienced employees with a customer service focus. We have been successful in attracting and retaining banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of our markets, through both individual hires and business combinations, which is central to our business strategy. Exceptional service, local involvement and timely decision-making are integral parts of our business strategy, and we continue to seek additional highly qualified and motivated individuals. We believe that by focusing on experienced bankers who are established in their communities, we enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities. Our compensation and incentive systems are aligned with our strategies to grow core deposits and our loan portfolio as the economy improves, while improving asset quality. We have a strong corporate culture based on personal accountability and high ethical standards with an emphasis on \"character\" and \"competence\" across all our business lines and locations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCertain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, bank regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings.\nBusiness Combinations and Acquired Loans. We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires us as acquirer to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as well as, recognize goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase, if appropriate. Any acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred.\nWe account for purchased performing loans acquired in business combinations using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans' contractual cash flows. We record purchased performing loans at fair value, including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. We do not establish any allowance for loan losses for purchased performing loans, however we will record a provision for loan losses for any further deterioration in these loans subsequent to the acquisition.\nWe consider loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected as purchased credit-impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include the internal loan risk grade, delinquent and nonaccrual status, recent credit scores, and recent loan-to-value percentages. We initially record PCI loans at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Thus, we do not establish any allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. We estimate the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date using specific credit reviews of certain loans and quantitative models incorporating credit risk, prepayment assumptions, and various other factors. These estimates require significant judgment given the impact of real estate prices, changing loss estimates, prepayment assumptions, and other relevant factors. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date, considering the impact of prepayments, is the nonaccretable difference and is available to absorb future loan chargeoffs.\nReal Estate Owned ( REO\u201d). REO represents real estate acquired as a result of customers' loan defaults. At the time of foreclosure, REO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell, which becomes the property's new basis. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent valuation adjustments to the carrying amount of the property are included in noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income. In some instances, we may make loans to facilitate the sales of REO. Management reviews all sales for which it is the lending institution for compliance with sales treatment under provisions established by Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 360, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.\u201d Any gains related to sales of REO may be deferred until the buyer has a sufficient initial and continuing investment in the property.\nGoodwill and Intangibles. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to assess either qualitative or quantitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference, but limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Other identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), this Form 10-K contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, which include: efficiency ratio; tangible book value per share; tangible equity to tangible assets ratio; net interest income and net interest margin as adjusted to exclude additional Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings and proceeds from such borrowings; net income, earnings per share (\"EPS\"), return on assets (\"ROA\"), and return on equity (\"ROE\") excluding merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, adjustments for the change in federal tax law, and gain from the sale of premises and equipment; and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans excluding acquired loans.\nManagement elected to utilize short-term FHLB borrowings beginning in November 2014 as part of a leverage strategy to increase net interest income. The Company believes that showing the effects of these borrowings on net interest income and net interest margin is useful to both management and investors as these measures are commonly used to measure financial institution's performance and against peers.\nThe Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital and earnings ability over time and in comparison to its competitors. These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total stockholders' equity or operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of our efficiency ratio:\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of tangible book value and tangible book value per share:\n\nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of tangible equity to tangible assets:\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n (1) Tangible book value is equal to total shareholders' equity less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of related deferred tax liabilities. \n (2) Total tangible assets is equal to total assets less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of related deferred tax liabilities. \nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP net interest income and net interest margin as adjusted to exclude additional FHLB borrowings and proceeds from such borrowings:\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Proceeds from the additional borrowings were invested in various interest-earning assets including: deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (\"FRB\"), FHLB stock, certificates of deposit in other banks, and commercial paper. \nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP net income, ROA, ROE, and EPS as adjusted to exclude merger-related expenses, certain state tax expense, adjustments for the change in federal tax law, gain on sale of premises and equipment, and impairment charges for branch consolidation:\n\n_______________________________________________________\n(1) State tax adjustment is a result of various revaluations of state deferred tax assets.\n(2) Revaluation of net deferred tax assets due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n(3) Tax amounts have been adjusted for certain nondeductible merger-related expenses.\n(4) Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Provision/(recovery) of loan losses was no longer included in this calculation.\n \nSet forth below is a reconciliation to GAAP of the allowance for loan losses to total loans and the allowance for loan losses as adjusted to exclude loans acquired through business combinations:\n\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017\nGeneral. Total assets increased $97.6 million, or 3.0% to $3.3 billion at June 30, 2018 from $3.2 billion at June 30, 2017. Total liabilities increased $86.0 million, or 3.1% to $2.9 billion at June 30, 2018 from $2.8 billion at June 30, 2017. Deposit growth of $147.8 million, or 7.2% and the cumulative decrease of $126.3 million, or 30.1% in cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit in other banks and investment securities during the year ended June 30, 2018 were used to partially fund the $174.4 million, or 7.4% increase in total loans receivable, the $79.2 million, or 52.9% increase in commercial paper, and reduce borrowings by $61.5 million, or 8.8%. We continue to utilize our leveraging strategy, where designated short-term FHLB borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income, as well as the required purchase of additional FHLB stock which generates increased dividend income; however, we have reduced the amount of assets purchased and liabilities assumed as part of the leveraging strategy during the past year and expect to continue reducing these amounts commensurate with anticipated organic loan growth.\nCash, cash equivalents, and commercial paper. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, to $70.7 million at June 30, 2018 from $87.0 million at June 30, 2017. In conjunction with our leveraging strategy, we purchase commercial paper to take advantage of higher returns with relatively low risk while remaining highly liquid. The commercial paper balance increased $79.2 million, or 52.9% to $229.1 million at June 30, 2018 from $149.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nInvestments. Securities available for sale decreased $44.7 million, to $155.0 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $199.7 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, certificates of deposit in other banks totaled $66.9 million compared to $132.3 million at June 30, 2017. All of the certificates of deposit in other banks are fully insured by the FDIC. The Company has reduced its liquidity position in order to fund recent loan growth. We evaluate individual investment securities quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in market value. We do not believe that there are any other-than-temporary impairments at June 30, 2018; therefore, no impairment losses have been recorded for fiscal 2018. Other investments include FHLB and FRB stock. FHLB stock decreased $2.2 million, to $29.9 million over the last fiscal year as a result of required redemptions of FHLB stock due to reduced FHLB borrowings. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is required to own FRB stock, which totaled $7.3 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, we held in other assets, $5.2 million of equity securities in small business investment companies.\nLoans. Net loans receivable increased $174.4 million, or 7.4%, to $2.5 billion at June 30, 2018 compared to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2017, primarily due to $170.5 million in net organic loan growth.\nFor fiscal year 2018, the retail loan segment portfolio originations increased to $323.6 million, or 5.9%, from $305.4 million the previous fiscal year. The commercial loan segment portfolio originations increased to $590.5 million, or 9.0%, from $541.5 million the previous fiscal year.\nRetail consumer and commercial loans consist of the following at the dates indicated: \nRecently, our expansion into larger metro markets as well as in-market acquisitions combined with improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory in certain markets have led to us significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market areas. We have hired experienced commercial real estate relationship managers, credit officers, and developed a construction risk management group to better manage construction risk, as part of our efforts to grow the construction portfolio. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction and land development lending by concentrating our efforts on smaller one-to-four residential loans to builders known to us and developers of commercial real estate and multifamily properties with proven success in this type of construction. At June 30, 2018, construction and land/lots totaled $65.6 million including $52.8 million of one-to-four family construction loans that will roll over to permanent loans upon completion of the construction period. Undisbursed construction and land/lots loan commitments at June 30, 2018 totaled $58.9 million. Total construction and development loans at June 30, 2018, were $192.1 million, excluding unfunded loan commitments of $209.7 million, of which $74.5 million was for non-residential commercial real estate construction, $64.5 million was for land development, $48.7 million was for speculative construction of single family properties, and $4.8 million was for multi-family construction. Undisbursed construction and development loan commitments at June 30, 2018 included $108.0 million of commercial real estate projects, multi-family residential projects of $12.4 million and $30.5 million for the speculative construction of one- to four-family residential properties.\nAsset Quality. Our overall asset quality metrics continue to demonstrate our commitment to growing and maintaining a loan portfolio with a moderate risk profile. Nonperforming assets decreased 27.0% to $14.6 million, or 0.44% of total assets, at June 30, 2018, compared to $20.0 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at June 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets included $10.9 million in nonaccruing loans and $3.7 million in REO at June 30, 2018, compared to $13.7 million and $6.3 million, in nonaccruing loans and REO, respectively, at June 30, 2017. Included in nonperforming loans are $4.2 million of loans restructured from their original terms of which $2.6 million were current with respect to their modified payment terms. The decrease in nonaccruing loans was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality throughout the loan portfolio and loans returning to performing status as payment history and the borrower's financial status improved. At June 30, 2018, $5.6 million, or 51.6%, of nonaccruing loans were current on their required loan payments. Purchased impaired loans aggregating $3.4 million acquired from prior acquisitions are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 0.43% at June 30, 2018 from 0.58% at June 30, 2017.\nThe ratio of classified assets to total assets decreased to 1.00% at June 30, 2018 from 1.57% at June 30, 2017. Classified assets decreased 34.2% to $33.1 million at June 30, 2018 compared to $50.2 million at June 30, 2017. Delinquent loans (loans delinquent 30 days or more) at June 30, 2018 were $9.8 million, or 0.4% of total loans compared to $15.2 million, or 0.6% of total loans at June 30, 2017.\nAs of June 30, 2018, impaired loans decreased to $31.4 million from $39.0 million at June 30, 2017. Our impaired loans are comprised of loans on non-accrual status and all TDRs, whether performing or on non-accrual status under their restructured terms. Impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or on a collective basis as part of homogeneous pools. For more information on these impaired loans, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAllowance for loan losses. We establish an allowance for loan losses by charging amounts to the loan provision at a level required to reflect estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loans losses, management considers, among other factors, historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers' ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and current risk factors specifically related to each loan\ntype. See \"Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\" for a description of the manner in which the provision for loan losses is established.\nOur allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2018 was $21.1 million, or 0.83% of total loans, compared to $21.2 million, or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 0.91% of gross loans at June 30, 2018, excluding acquired loans from the allowance for loan losses in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, as compared to 1.03% at June 30, 2017. The Company recorded these loans at fair value, which includes a credit discount, therefore, no allowance for loan losses is established for these loans at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent deterioration in credit quality will result in a provision for loan losses. The allowance for our acquired loans at June 30, 2018 was $483,000 compared to $727,000 at June 30, 2017. There was no provision for loan losses for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 as the allowance for loan losses required by our loan growth was offset by continued improvements in our asset quality. Net loan charge-offs decreased to $91,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $141,000 for fiscal 2017. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.00% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 0.01% for last fiscal year. The allowance as a percentage of nonaccruing loans increased to 192.96% at June 30, 2018, compared to 154.77% a year earlier.\nWe believe that the allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2018 was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nReal estate owned. REO decreased $2.6 million, to $3.7 million at June 30, 2018 primarily due to $3.9 million in sales of REO, which were partially offset by $1.3 million in transfers from foreclosed loans. The total balance of REO included $1.7 million in commercial real estate, $998,000 in single-family homes and $956,000 in land, construction and development projects (both residential and commercial) at June 30, 2018.\nDeferred income taxes. Deferred income taxes decreased $24.8 million, or 43.3%, to $32.6 million at June 30, 2018 from $57.4 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017, the realization of net operating losses through increases in taxable income, and to a lesser extent, the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets, as discussed below. For more information on the Tax Act's impact on the Company's deferred income taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased $147.8 million, or 7.2%, to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2018 from $2.0 billion at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $93.8 million increase in our core deposits, in particular a $108.1 million or 19.0% increase in money market accounts, from marketing initiatives and a $54.0 million increase in certificates of deposit, which related to additional brokered deposits. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $108.9 million and $16.8 million in brokered deposits, respectively.\nBorrowings. Borrowings, comprised of FHLB advances, decreased to $635.0 million at June 30, 2018 from $696.5 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018 there were $255.0 million in FHLB advances with maturities less than 90 days and $150.0 million in convertible FHLB advances with maturities greater than one year; together with a weighted average interest rate of 1.95%.\nEquity. Stockholders' equity at June 30, 2018 increased to $409.2 million from $397.6 million at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $8.2 million in net income, $3.0 million in stock-based compensation, and $680,000 in a cumulative adjustment for the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in other comprehensive income representing unrealized losses on investment securities, net of tax. Tangible book value per share increased $0.59, or 3.0% to $19.96 as of June 30, 2018 compared to $19.37 at June 30, 2017.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table sets forth the average balance sheets, interest income and expense, and average yields and costs. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.\n\n (1) The average loans receivable, net balances include loans held for sale and nonaccruing loans. \n (2) Interest income used in the average interest/earned and yield calculation includes the tax equivalent adjustment of $1.6 million, $2.4 million, and $2.5 million for fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, calculated based on a combined federal and state tax rate of 30%, 37%, and 37%, respectively. \n (3) The average other interest-earning assets consists of FRB stock, FHLB stock, and commercial paper. \n (4) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.\n\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017\nGeneral. During 2018, we had net income of $8.2 million, a $3.6 million or 30.5% decrease compared to net income of $11.8 million earned in 2017. The Company's diluted earnings per share was $0.44 for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to $0.65 for the year ended June 30, 2017. Earnings for the year ended June 30, 2018 included a $17.9 million write-down of deferred tax assets following a deferred tax revaluation resulting from enactment of the Tax Act with no comparable charge in fiscal year 2017, which was partially offset by the absence of merger-related expenses, which totaled $7.8 million in fiscal year 2017.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2018 and before the write-down of deferred tax assets from the change in the federal tax rate, merger-related expenses, certain state income tax expenses, and gains from the sale of premises and equipment (non-GAAP) net income was $25.9 million, or $1.38 in diluted earnings per share compared to $17.1 million, or $0.94 in diluted earnings per share for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2018 was $100.6 million, a $9.4 million, or 10.4% increase from $91.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2018 reflects a $17.3 million increase in interest and dividend income due primarily to an increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in interest expense.\nDuring 2018, average interest-earning assets increased $292.3 million, or 10.9% to $3.0 billion compared to $2.7 billion for 2017. The $338.5 million, or 16.3% increase in average balance of total loans receivable for the year ended June 30, 2018 was due to a full year's impact of the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth. This increase was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $46.2 million, or 7.6% in all other average interest-earning assets, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $152.2 million, or 9.2%, and an $80.4 million, or 13.9% increase in average borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for the year ended June 30, 2018 decreased six basis points to 3.43% from 3.49% for last year. For the year ended June 30, 2018, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $4.1 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.90%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 1.39%, resulting in approximately $1.1 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest and dividend income at an average yield of 1.14% during fiscal year 2017, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the tax equivalent net interest margin would be 3.66% and 3.88% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2018 was $116.7 million, compared to $99.4 million for 2017, an increase of $17.3 million, or 17.4%. The increase was primarily driven by a $15.0 million, or 16.7% increase in loan interest income, a $2.2 million, or 59.4% increase in certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing deposits, and a $354,000, or 21.3% increase in other investment income partially offset by a $315,000, or 7.9% decrease in interest income from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable, which was partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 from $6.1 million for fiscal year 2017, resulting from the full repayments of several loans with large discounts in the previous year. This decrease caused average loan yields to decrease three basis points to 4.41% for the year ended June 30, 2018 from 4.44% in fiscal 2017. The accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year. Excluding the effects of the accretion on purchase discounts on acquired loans, loan yields increased 13 basis points to 4.28% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 4.15% in fiscal 2017.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $16.1 million in 2018, a $7.8 million, or 94.9% increase from $8.2 million in 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increase in average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings coupled with the increased cost of nine and 78 basis points for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The overall cost of funds increased 28 basis points to 0.65% for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to 0.37% in the last fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the target federal funds rate on the cost of our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2018 and 2017, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nSee \"Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2018 and 2017 - Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses\" for additional details.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $19.7 million for 2018 compared to $16.1 million for 2017. The $3.6 million, or 22.1% increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million, or 14.2% increase in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the increase in deposit accounts and related fees; a $1.8 million, or 49.6% increase in loan income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans and various commercial loan-related fees driven by the commencing of originations and sales of the guaranteed portion of U.S Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) commercial loans; and an $879,000, or 38.9% increase in other noninterest income mainly from investments in small business investment companies. Partially offsetting these increases was a $221,000, or 57.4% decrease in gains from the sale of premises and equipment for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last fiscal year.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $85.3 million in 2018, a $4.9 million, or 5.5% decrease from $90.3 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the previously mentioned $7.8 million of merger-related expenses; a $192,000, or 11.5% decrease in marketing and advertising; a $210,000, or 3.2% decrease in computer services; and a $222,000, or 15.7% decrease in real estate owned (\"REO\") related expenses primarily as a result of fewer REO properties held. Partially offsetting these decreases were the additional expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition, a new commercial loan production office in Greensboro, NC, new SBA and equipment finance lines of business, and the opening of a de novo branch in Cary, NC as shown in the cumulative increase of $3.4 million, or 5.0% in salaries and employee benefits; net occupancy expense; telephone, postage, and supplies; and other expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to last year. Deposit insurance premiums increased $241,000, or 17.5% as the net asset base has increased.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $26.7 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.2 million in 2017. The increase was mainly driven by the Tax Act's reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, which required the Company to revalue net deferred tax assets and establish the tax valuation allowance on a portion of our alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credits in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidelines, resulting in a $17.9 million adjustment through income tax expense; and to a lesser extent higher pre-tax income. In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had a benefit of $142,000 as compared to a charge of $490,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017 related to the revaluation of various state deferred tax assets. In addition, our June 30 fiscal year end required the use of a blended federal income tax rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The blended federal income tax rate of 27.5% was retroactively effective July 1, 2017 and was used for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. For more information on income taxes and deferred taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nComparison of Results of Operation for the Year Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. During 2017, we had net income of $11.8 million, a $391,000 or 3.4% increase compared to net income of $11.5 million earned in 2016. The Company's diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for both years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The leading factors in the increase of net income for both periods ended June 30, 2017 were an increase in net interest income from organic loan growth and the acquisition of TriSummit, which outpaced all merger-related expenses. The Company's earnings per share were impacted by the issuance of 765,277 new common shares in conjunction with the TriSummit acquisition on January 1, 2017.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for 2017 was $91.2 million, a $9.5 million, or 11.6% increase from $81.7 million in 2016. During 2017, average interest-earning assets increased $187.5 million, or 7.5% to $2.7 billion compared to $2.5 billion for 2016. The $316.3 million, or 17.9% increase in average balance of loan receivables for 2017 was due to the TriSummit acquisition and increased organic loan growth, which was mainly funded by the cumulative decrease of $128.8 million, or 17.6% in average interest-earning deposits with banks, securities available for sale, and other interest-earning assets and an increase in average FHLB borrowings of $95.3 million, or 19.7%.\nNet interest margin (on a fully taxable-equivalent basis) for 2017 increased 12 basis points to 3.49% from 3.37% for last year. During 2017, our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.6 million in interest income at an average yield of 1.14%, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.58%, resulting in approximately $1.8 million in net interest income. Our leveraging strategy produced an additional $3.3 million in interest income at an average yield of 0.81% during 2016, while the average cost of the borrowings was 0.31%, resulting in approximately $2.0 million in net interest income. Excluding the effects of the leveraging strategy, the net interest margin would have decreased five basis points to 3.88% for 2017 compared to 3.93% for 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2017 was $99.4 million, compared to $87.7 million for 2016, an increase of $11.7 million, or 13.3%.The increase was primarily driven by an $11.6 million, or 14.8% increase in loan interest income and a $196,000, or 13.4% increase in other investment income, which were partially offset by a $178,000, or 4.3% decrease in interest from securities available for sale. The additional loan interest income was due to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and a $1.6 million increase in the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans to $6.1 million for 2017 from $4.5 million for 2016, as a result of early prepayments. Net interest margin is enhanced by the amortization of purchase accounting discounts on purchased loans and certificates of deposit received in recent acquisitions, which is accreted into net interest income. This additional income stems from the discount established at the time these loan portfolios were acquired and the related impact of prepayments on purchased loans. Each quarter, the Company analyzes the cash flow assumptions on loan pools purchased and, at least semi-annually, the Company updates loss estimates, prepayment speeds, and other variables when analyzing cash flows. In addition to this accretion income, which is recognized over the estimated life of the loans pools, if a loan is removed from a pool due to payoff or foreclosure, the unaccreted discount in excess of losses is recognized as an accretion gain in interest income. As a result, income from loan pools can be volatile from quarter to quarter as well as year over year.\nAverage loan yields decreased 15 basis points to 4.44% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.59% in fiscal 2016. For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the average loan yields included 29 and 26 basis points, respectively, from the accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans.\nDue to a significant number of adjustable-rate loans in the loan portfolio with interest rate floors below which the loans' contractual interest rate may not adjust, net interest income will be negatively impacted in a rising interest rate environment until such time as the current rate exceeds these interest rate floors. As of June 30, 2017, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $633.8 million or 27.0% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%; $192.6 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $148.0 million, or 76.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense was $8.2 million in 2017, a $2.2 million, or 36.5% increase from $6.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings increasing interest expense on borrowings by $2.1 million to $3.7 million for 2017 as compared to $1.5 million in 2016. In addition, average borrowings increased by $95.3 million to $577.8 million to partially fund the increase in total loans and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. The TriSummit acquisition was the leading factor for the $298.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. The overall average cost of funds increased eight basis points to 0.37% for 2017 compared to 0.29% for 2016 primarily due to the impact of the recent increases in the federal funds rate on our borrowings.\nProvision for Loan Losses. During 2017 and 2016, there was no provision for loan losses reflecting the decline in our required provision loan losses due to the continued improvements in our asset quality outpacing the additional provision otherwise required due to our loan growth. The provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriated level based upon management's evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves, trends in delinquencies and net charge-offs and current economic conditions.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income was $16.1 million for 2017 compared to $14.3 million for 2016. The $1.8 million, or 12.7% increase was primarily due to a $576,000, or 18.8% increase in loan income and fees from increases in originations of mortgage loans held for sale, a $445,000, or 27.1% increase in BOLI income, and a $385,000 gain on the sale of a previously closed branch office building. In addition, service charges on deposit accounts increased $362,000, or 5.4%, reflecting the increase in deposit accounts from the TriSummit acquisition.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was $90.3 million in 2017, a $10.6 million, or 13.3% increase from $79.6 million in 2016. The overall increase was primarily due to $7.8 million of merger-related expenses related to the TriSummit acquisition. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $3.9 million, or 9.3% as a result of the TriSummit acquisition and an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by the increase in the Company's stock price. As a result of management's continued commitment to reduce operating expenses and the\nconsolidation of six branches during the second quarter of 2016, there was a cumulative decrease of $773,000, or 5.4% in net occupancy expense; marketing and advertising; and telephone, postage, and supplies. This decrease was offset by an $837,000, or 14.4% increase in computer services as a result of the TriSummit acquisition. In addition, deposit insurance premiums decreased $607,000, or 30.6% due to a decline in the rates charged by the FDIC that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. REO-related expenses decreased $385,000 as a result of a $234,000 decrease in writedowns and net losses on the sale of REO properties and a $151,000 decrease in REO expenses.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes was $5.2 million for fiscal 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 30.5%, as compared to $4.9 million and an effective tax rate of 30.0% in 2016, as a result of higher income before taxes. During 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred a charge of $490,000 and $526,000, respectively, which related to the decrease in value of our deferred tax assets based on recent decreases in North Carolina's corporate tax rate. The rate was reduced to 4.0% in August 2015 and to 3.0% in August 2016 once certain state revenue triggers were achieved.\nAsset/Liability Management\nOur Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. If interest rates rise, our net interest income could be reduced because interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and borrowings, could increase more quickly than interest received on interest-earning assets, including loans and other investments. In addition, rising interest rates may hurt our income because they may reduce the demand for loans.\nHow We Measure Our Risk of Interest Rate Changes. As part of our process to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we monitor our interest rate risk. In monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on market conditions, their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities, their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates, and interest rate sensitivities of the Company's non-maturity deposits with respect to interest rates paid and the level of balances. The board of directors sets the asset and liability policy of HomeTrust Bank, which is implemented by management and an asset/liability committee whose members include certain members of senior management.\nThe purpose of this committee is to communicate, coordinate and control asset/liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies. The committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk, and profitability goals.\nThe committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital position, anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations. The committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly.\nAmong the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are: (i) increasing our portfolio of hybrid and adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential loans and commercial loans; (ii) maintaining a strong capital position, which provides for a favorable level of interest-earning assets relative to interest-bearing liabilities; and (iii) emphasizing less interest rate sensitive and lower-costing core deposits.\u201d We also maintain a portfolio of short-term or adjustable-rate assets and use fixed-rate FHLB advances and brokered deposits to extend the term to repricing of our liabilities.\nWe consider the relatively short duration of our deposits in our overall asset/liability management process. As short-term rates increase, we have assets and liabilities that increase with the market. This is reflected in the change in our present value equity ( PVE\u201d) when rates increase (see the table below). PVE is defined as the net present value of our existing assets and liabilities. In addition, we have historically demonstrated an ability to maintain retail deposits through various interest rate cycles. If local retail deposit rates increase dramatically, we also have access to wholesale funding through our lines of credit with the FHLB and FRB, as well as through the brokered deposit market to replace retail deposits, as needed.\nDepending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the committee may in the future determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin. In particular, we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our assets and liabilities portfolios can, during periods of stable or declining interest rates, provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates. As a result of this philosophy, our results of operations and the economic value of our equity will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to declines due to differences between long- and short-term interest rates.\nThe committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and our PVE. The committee also valuates these impacts against the potential changes in net interest income and market value of our portfolio equity that are monitored by the board of directors of HomeTrust Bank generally on a quarterly basis.\nOur asset/liability management strategy sets limits on the change in PVE given certain changes in interest rates. The table presented here, as of June 30, 2018, is forward-looking information about our sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The table incorporates data from an independent\nservice, as it relates to maturity repricing and repayment/withdrawal of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk is measured by changes in PVE for instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 400 basis points. Given the current targeted federal funds rate is 1.75% to 2.00% making an immediate change of -200 and -300 basis points improbable, a PVE calculation for a decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. An increase in rates would slightly increase our PVE because the repricing of nonmaturing deposits tend to lag behind the increase in market rates. This positive impact is partially offset by the negative effect from our loans with interest rate floors which will not adjust until such time as a loan's current interest rate adjusts to an increase in market rates which exceeds the interest rate floor. Conversely, in a falling interest rate environment these interest rate floors will assist in maintaining our net interest income. As of June 30, 2018, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $611.5 million or 16.1% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.00%, $71.3 million of these loans were at their floor rate, of which $57.0 million, or 79.9%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points.\n\nIn evaluating our exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all of these factors in monitoring our exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe board of directors and management of HomeTrust Bank believe that certain factors afford HomeTrust Bank the ability to operate successfully despite its exposure to interest rate risk. HomeTrust Bank may manage its interest rate risk by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in its portfolio, by borrowing from the FHLB to match the duration of our funding to the duration of originated fixed rate one-to-four family and commercial loans held in portfolio and by selling on an ongoing basis certain currently originated longer term fixed rate one-to-four family real estate loans.\nLiquidity\nManagement maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio.\nIn addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bank had an additional borrowing capacity of $79.3 million with the FHLB of Atlanta, a $132.3 million line of credit with the FRB, and three lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $60.0 million. At June 30, 2018, we had $635.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Additionally, the Company classifies its securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our security portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. In addition, we have historically sold fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At June 30, 2018, brokered deposits totaled $108.9 million or 4.96% of total deposits.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities. The Company on a stand-alone level is a separate legal entity from HomeTrust\nBank and must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses. The Company's primary source of funds consists of the net proceeds retained by the Company from the Conversion. We also have the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from HomeTrust Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of HomeTrust Bank to pay dividends. At June 30, 2018, the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $23.0 million.\nWe use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At June 30, 2018, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to $259.7 million and $491.6 million, respectively, as compared to $202.1 million and $414.4 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2017. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at June 30, 2018, totaled $385.7 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with us.\nDuring fiscal 2018, cash and cash equivalents decreased $16.2 million, or 18.7%, from $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 to $70.7 million as of June 30, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities of $31.3 million and financing activities of $86.4 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $134.0 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2018 included proceeds from maturities of investment securities of $20.7 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $65.3 million, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $20.5 million, and a $147.8 million increase in net deposits. Primary uses of cash during the period included an increase in portfolio loans of $168.6 million, a $3.5 million increase in fixed asset purchases, a decrease in borrowings of $61.5 million, and the purchase of commercial paper, net of maturities, of $75.2 million. All sources and uses of cash reflect our cash management strategy to increase our amount of higher yielding investments and loans, reducing our holdings in lower yielding investments and increasing our lower costing deposits.\nDuring fiscal 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased $34.4 million, or 65.4%, from $52.6 million as of June 30, 2016 to $87.0 million as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to the increase in borrowings to partially fund the increase in total loans, and to provide funds for the TriSummit acquisition and our leveraging strategy. Cash provided by operating activities of $15.1 million and financing activities of $126.0 million was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $106.8 million. Primary sources of cash for the year ended June 30, 2017 included proceeds from an increase in borrowings of $158.0 million, maturities and sales of investment securities of $46.4 million, maturities of commercial paper, net of purchases, of $81.0 million, maturities of certificates of deposit in other banks, net of purchases, of $29.5 million, and principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities of $23.9 million. Primary uses of cash during the period included, the purchase of securities available for sale of $15.1 million, a $34.5 million decrease in net deposits, an increase in portfolio loans of $255.9 million, a $2.8 million increase in fixed asset purchases, and $10.6 million for the TriSummit acquisition, net of cash received.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the Company's significant contractual obligations at June 30, 2018 (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Activities\nIn the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the year ended June 30, 2018, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA summary of our off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit at June 30, 2018, is as follows (in thousands):\n\nCapital Resources\nAt June 30, 2018, equity totaled $409.2 million. Management monitors the capital levels of the Company to provide for current and future business opportunities and to ensure HomeTrust Bank meets regulatory guidelines for well-capitalized\u201d institutions.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d). As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve\nunder the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in the same manner to those applicable to bank holding companies.\nHomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank are required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.'s and the Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. At June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.\nConsistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a well-capitalized\u201d status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. As of June 30, 2018, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 11.70%, 11.70%, 12.45%, and 10.33%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 11.68%, 11.68%, 12.50%, and 9.97%, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2018, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios of 12.97%, 12.97%, 13.72%, and 11.45%, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-Based, Total Risk-Based, and Tier 1 Leverage capital ratios were 13.07%, 13.07%, 13.89%, and 11.13%, respectively.\nSee Item 1, Business-How We are Regulated,\u201d and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details on the Company's capital requirements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of noninterest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits, and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. Our management is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of

in loans and commercial paper, funded by growth in deposits and a reduction in borrowings and other interest-earning assets. \n\n- Net loans increased 7.4% to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in commercial real estate and commercial & industrial loans. Asset quality improved with lower levels of nonperforming assets.\n\n- Net interest income increased 10.4% to $100.6 million due to growth in interest-earning assets. Net interest margin declined slightly to 3.43% due to the impact of interest rate floors on adjustable-rate loans. \n\n- Noninterest income increased 22.1% to $19.7 million primarily due to higher service charges on deposits and growth in mortgage and SBA lending income. \n\n- Noninterest expense decreased 5.5% to $85.3 million primarily due to the absence of merger expenses incurred in the prior year.\n\n- Net income declined 30.5% to $8.2 million, impacted by a $17.9 million write-down of deferred tax assets due to changes in tax laws. Excluding this and other adjustments, net income increased 51% year-over-year. \n\n- Capital levels remained strong with all regulatory capital ratios well above required minimums for the Bank and holding company. \n\n- The Company has adequate sources of liquidity including deposit growth, cash flows from the securities portfolio and loan repayments, and access to additional borrowings.\n\nIn summary, the Company demonstrated solid loan growth and improved profitability while maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions. The tax law change negatively impacted reported net income."}
