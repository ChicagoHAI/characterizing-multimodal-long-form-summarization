MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is management's analysis of our financial performance and of significant trends that may affect our future performance. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report on Form 10-K\"). Those statements in the MD&A that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.\nUnless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to \"Delek Logistics Partners, LP,\" the \"Partnership,\" we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d or like terms, may refer to Delek Logistics Partners, LP, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole. Unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to \"Delek Holdings\" refer collectively to Delek US Holdings, Inc. and any of its subsidiaries, other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries and its general partner.\nEffective August 13, 2020, the Partnership closed the transaction contemplated by a definitive exchange agreement with the general partner to eliminate all of the incentive distribution rights (\"IDRs\") held by the general partner and convert the 2.0% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for 14.0 million newly issued common limited partner units and $45.0 million in cash (\"IDR Restructuring Transaction\"). Contemporaneously, Delek Holdings purchased a 5.2% ownership interest in our general partner from certain affiliates, who were also members of our general partner's management and board of directors. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective May 1, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Transportation, LLC, acquired Delek Trucking, LLC consisting of certain leased and owned tractors and trailers and related assets (the \"Trucking Assets\") from Delek Holdings, such transaction the \"Trucking Assets Acquisition.\" See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Permian Gathering, LLC, acquired from Delek Holdings a crude oil gathering system located in Howard, Borden and Martin Counties, Texas (the \"Big Spring Gathering Assets\"), and certain related assets, such transaction the \"Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition.\" See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective March 1, 2018, the Partnership acquired from Delek Holdings certain logistics assets primarily located at or adjacent to Delek Holdings' Big Spring, Texas refinery (the \"Big Spring Refinery\"). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the acquisition.\nThe Partnership announces material information to the public about the Partnership, its products and services and other matters through a variety of means, including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, public conference calls, the Partnership's website (www.deleklogistics.com), the investor relations section of the website (ir.deleklogistics.com), the news section of its website (www.deleklogistics.com/news), and/or social media, including its Twitter account (@DelekLogistics). The Partnership encourages investors and others to review the information it makes public in these locations, as such information could be deemed to be material information. Please note that this list may be updated from time to time.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (including information incorporated by reference) contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

Important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022our substantial dependence on Delek Holdings or its assignees and their support of and respective ability to pay us under our commercial agreements;\n\u2022our future coverage, leverage, financial flexibility and growth, and our ability to improve performance and achieve distribution growth at any level or at all;\n\u2022Delek Holdings' future growth, financial performance, share repurchases, crude oil supply pricing and flexibility and product distribution;\n\u2022industry dynamics, including Permian Basin growth, ownership concentration, efficiencies and takeaway capacity;\n\u2022the age and condition of our assets and operating hazards and other risks incidental to transporting, storing and gathering crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including, but not limited to, costs, penalties, regulatory or legal actions and other effects related to spills, releases and tank failures;\n\u2022changes in insurance markets impacting costs and the level and types of coverage available;\n\u2022the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for refined products and the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on such demand;\n\u2022the wholesale marketing margins we are able to obtain and the number of barrels of product we are able to purchase and sell in our West Texas wholesale business;\n\u2022the suspension, reduction or termination of Delek Holdings' or its assignees' or third-party's obligations under our commercial agreements including the duration, fees or terms thereof;\n\u2022the results of our investments in joint ventures;\n\u2022the ability to secure commercial agreements with Delek Holdings or third parties upon expiration of existing agreements;\n\u2022the possibility of inefficiencies, curtailments, or shutdowns in refinery operations or pipelines, whether due to infection in the workforce or in response to reductions in demand as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure, or other events, including terrorism, sabotage or cyber attacks, at our facilities, Delek Holdings' facilities or third-party facilities on which our business is dependent;\n\u2022changes in the availability and cost of capital of debt and equity financing;\n\u2022our reliance on information technology systems in our day-to-day operations;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions, including uncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of economic recovery in the United States due to the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") and state commissions and those relating to environmental protection, pipeline integrity and safety as well as current and future restrictions on commercial and economic activities in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022competitive conditions in our industry;\n\u2022actions taken by our customers and competitors;\n\u2022the demand for crude oil, refined products and transportation and storage services;\n\u2022our ability to successfully implement our business plan;\n\u2022inability to complete growth projects on time and on budget;\n\u2022our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses;\n\u2022disruptions due to acts of God, including natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control;\n\u2022future decisions by OPEC+ regarding production and pricing and disputes between OPEC+ regarding such;\n\u2022changes or volatility in interest and inflation rates;\n\u2022labor relations;\n\u2022large customer defaults;\n\u2022changes in tax status and regulations;\n\u2022the effects of future litigation; and\n\u2022other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMany of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, our actual results of operations and execution of our business strategy could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance upon them. In addition, past financial and/or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance, and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends. We can give no assurances\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nthat any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Partnership primarily owns and operates crude oil, intermediate and refined products logistics and marketing assets. We gather, transport, offload and store crude oil and intermediate products and market, distribute, transport and store refined products primarily in select regions of the southeastern United States and Texas for Delek Holdings and third parties. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent upon the success of Delek Holdings' refining operations, as many of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek Holdings in support of its Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring refineries.\nThe Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview\" for further details.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 (the \"COVID-19 Pandemic\" or the \"Pandemic\") has resulted in significant economic disruption globally, including in the U.S. and specific geographic areas where we operate. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through both voluntary and mandated social distancing, curfews, shutdowns and expanded safety measures, have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use, leading to a substantial decrease in consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic which caused reduced consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons during the year ended December 31, 2020 in the United States and globally. Therefore, downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2020, governmental authorities in various states across the U.S., particularly those states in our Permian Basin and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, lifted many of the restrictions created by actions taken to slow down the spread of COVID-19. These actions resulted in an increase in the level of individual movement and travel and, in turn, an increase in the demand and market prices for some of our products relative to late March 2020. However, many of the states where such restrictions were lifted subsequently experienced a marked increase in the spread of COVID-19 and many governmental authorities in such areas responded by re-imposing certain restrictions they had previously lifted. In addition, certain countries globally recently re-imposed previously lifted restrictions due to worsening effects of the increased spread of COVID-19. This response, as well as the increased infection rates, impacts regions that we serve and could significantly impact demand in ways that we cannot predict. Additionally, increased infection rates could impact our logistics operations, particularly in high-infection states, if our employees are personally affected by the illness, both through direct infection and quarantine procedures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, both our West Texas wholesale marketing business and many of our pipeline and transportation customers have experienced the impact on demand and pricing of these unprecedented conditions. Our pipelines and transportation revenue streams were largely protected by minimum commitments under existing throughput contracts with customers during the current period, but continued pressure on our customers could present risks to our existing and new business opportunities as well as on collectability on our receivables. We continue to experience operational constraints as well, including COVID-19 infections at certain of our company locations that have resulted in re-imposed or expanded remote policies and quarantine protocols. We continue to be faced with risk from our suppliers and customers who are facing similar challenges.\nWe have identified the following uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, including the impact related to crude storage space shortages:\n\u2022Customers directly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events in terms of demand for refined product may reduce throughputs which could, likewise, impact the throughput demand for our pipelines, and may seek to renegotiate minimums under contractual force majeure provisions. Such reductions could have a significant impact on our revenues, cost of sales, operating income and liquidity, as well to the carrying value of long-lived or indefinite-lived assets;\n\u2022Customers may experience financial difficulties which could interrupt the volumes ordered by those customers and/or could impact the credit worthiness of such customers and the collectability of their outstanding receivables;\n\u2022Equity method investees may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and/or other events, which may increase the risk of impairment of those investments;\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022The decline in demand and pricing on our wholesale marketing segment and a decline in demand for pipelines and transportation impacting current results and/or forecasts could result in impairments in certain of our long-lived or indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, or have other financial statement impacts that cannot currently be anticipated;\n\u2022While our current liquidity needs are managed by existing credit facilities, sources of future liquidity needs may be impacted by the volatility in the debt market and the availability and pricing of such funds as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events; and\n\u2022The U.S. Federal Government has enacted certain stimulus and relief measures and is continuing to consider additional relief legislation. To the extent that the provisions do not directly impact the Partnership in the current period or are intended to stimulate or provide relief to the greater U.S. economy and/or consumer, the impact and success of such efforts remains unknown.\nOther uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events may exist that have not been identified or that are not specifically listed above, and could impact our future results of operations and financial position, the nature of which and the extent to which are currently unknown. Actions taken by OPEC+ in April and June 2020, including the agreement for management of crude oil supply in the hopes of contributing to market stabilization (the \"Oil Production Cuts\"), as well as the U.S. Federal Government's passage and/or enactment of additional stimulus and relief measures, may impact the extent to which the risk underlying these uncertainties are realized. To the extent these uncertainties have been identified and are believed to have an impact on our current period results of operations or financial position based on the requirements for assessing such financial statement impact under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we have considered them in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events on our business. Such efforts include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\u2022Reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021;\n\u2022Identifying alternative financing solutions to enhance our access to sources of liquidity;\n\u2022Enacting cost reduction measures across the organization, including reducing contract services, reducing overtime and reducing or eliminating non-critical travel which serves the dual purpose of also complying with recommendations made by the state and federal governments because of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022Implementing regular site cleaning and disinfecting procedures;\n\u2022Adopting remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, appropriate safety precautions taken; and\n\u2022Working with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure.\nThe extent to which our future results are affected by COVID-19 Pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the Pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. The COVID-19 Pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the Pandemic, could also exacerbate the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 Pandemic may also materially adversely affect our results in a manner that is either not currently known or that we do not currently consider to be a significant risk to our business.\nSee also 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nOur Reporting Segments and Assets\nOur business consists of two reportable segments:\n(i) Pipelines and Transportation\nThe assets and investments in our pipelines and transportation segment consist of pipelines, tanks, offloading facilities, trucks and ancillary assets, which provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services primarily in support of Delek Holdings' refining operations in Tyler, Texas, El Dorado, Arkansas and Big Spring, Texas. Additionally, the assets in this segment provide crude oil transportation services to certain third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store. Therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices with respect to this operating segment.\n(ii) Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling\nThe assets in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment consist of refined products terminals and pipelines in Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. We generate revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler and Big Spring refineries, engaging in wholesale activity at our terminals in West Texas and at\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nterminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and by providing terminalling services at our refined products terminals to independent third parties and Delek Holdings.\n2020 Developments\nRestructuring Transaction\nEffective August 13, 2020, the Partnership closed the transaction contemplated by a definitive exchange agreement with the general partner to eliminate all of the IDRs held by the general partner and convert the 2% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest, both in exchange for 14.0 million newly issued common limited partner units and $45.0 million in cash (the \"IDR Restructuring Transaction\"). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which subsequently became effective, for the proposed re-sale or other disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nRed River Expansion project\nIn August 2020, Red River, a joint venture equity method investment which owns a crude oil pipeline running from Cushing, Oklahoma to Longview, Texas, completed a planned expansion project to increase the pipeline capacity from 150,000 bpd to 235,000 bpd. The expansion project commenced operations on October 1, 2020.\nInflation Adjustments\nOn July 1, 2020, the tariffs on our FERC regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties that are subject to adjustment using the FERC indexing increased by approximately 2%, which was the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties, the fee adjusted based on the consumer price index increased 1.6% and the fees adjusted based on producer price index decreased approximately 1.2%. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview-2020 Developments\" for further details.\nTrucking Assets Acquisition\nEffective May 1, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Transportation, LLC, acquired Delek Trucking, LLC consisting of certain leased and owned tractors and trailers and related assets from Delek Holdings. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBig Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Permian Gathering, LLC, acquired the Big Spring Gathering Assets from Delek Holdings, located in Howard, Borden and Martin Counties, Texas. See Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIDR Waiver\nOn March 31, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights (\"IDRs\") associated with the 5.0 million newly issued common limited partner units (\"Additional Units\") for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBusiness Strategies\nOur objectives are to maintain stable cash flows and to grow the quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders over time. We are focused on growing our asset base within our geographic area through acquisitions, project development, joint ventures and enhancing our existing systems. While we will continue to evaluate ways to provide Delek Holdings with logistics services, our emphasis will be to increase the logistics services that we offer to third parties. We intend to achieve these objectives through the following business strategies:\n\u2022Generate Stable Cash Flow. We will continue to pursue opportunities to provide logistics, marketing and other services to Delek Holdings and third parties pursuant to long-term, fee-based contracts. In new service contracts, we will endeavor to include minimum volume throughput or other commitments, similar to those included in our current commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022Focus on Growing Our Business. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to grow our business through both strategic acquisitions and expansion and construction projects, both internally funded or in combination with potential external partners and through investments in joint ventures. Additionally, we believe that our strong relationship with Delek Holdings will enhance our opportunities to grow our business.\n\u25e6Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that both complement our existing assets and provide attractive returns for our unitholders. As we continue to grow through acquisitions, we believe we will be able to increase our third party business. In addition to those opportunities to acquire assets from Delek Holdings described below, we believe that our current asset base, and our knowledge of the regional markets in which we operate, will enable us to target and complete attractive third-party acquisitions.\n\u25e6Investments in Joint Ventures. We have grown our asset base to include investments in joint ventures, which have contributed to our initiative to grow our midstream business, while increasing our crude oil sourcing flexibility. We intend to continue evaluating growth opportunities through these investments.\n\u2022Engage in Mutually Beneficial Transactions with Delek Holdings. Delek Holdings has granted us a right of first offer on certain logistics assets. We intend to review our right to purchase any such assets as they are offered to us under the terms of the right of first offer, from time to time. Delek Holdings is also required, under certain circumstances, to offer us the opportunity to purchase additional logistics assets that Delek Holdings may acquire or construct in the future. Further, we anticipate additional growth opportunities through subsequent dropdowns of logistics assets acquired or developed by Delek Holdings. For example, Delek Holdings anticipates offering us certain gathering and logistics assets. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such transaction or whether or on what terms dropdowns will be offered to us by Delek Holdings. We continue to evaluate options with respect to dropdown transactions, which may include changes in capital structure.\n\u25e6Pursue Attractive Expansion and Construction Opportunities. We intend to pursue organic growth opportunities that complement our existing businesses or that provide attractive returns within or outside our current geographic footprint. We plan to evaluate potential opportunities to make capital investments that will be used to expand our existing asset base through the expansion and construction of new logistics assets to support growth of any of our customers', including Delek Holdings', businesses and from increased third-party activity. These construction projects may be developed either through joint venture relationships or by us acting independently, depending on size and scale.\n\u2022Optimize Our Existing Assets and Expand Our Customer Base. We seek to enhance the profitability of our existing assets by adding incremental throughput volumes, improving operating efficiencies and increasing system-wide utilization. We also expect to further diversify our customer base by increasing third-party throughput volumes running through certain of our existing systems and expanding our existing asset portfolio to service more third-party customers.\nCommercial Agreements with Delek Holdings\nThe Partnership has a number of long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Delek Holdings under which we provide various services, including crude oil gathering, crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services, and marketing, terminalling and offloading services to Delek Holdings, and Delek Holdings commits to provide us with minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil, intermediate and refined products. Generally, these agreements include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments and have tariffs or fees indexed to inflation-based indices, provided that the tariffs or fees will not be decreased below the initial amount. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\nOther Transactions\nStarting in 2018, the Partnership manages a long-term capital project on behalf of Delek Holdings pursuant to a construction management and operating agreement (the \"DPG Management Agreement\") for the construction of a 250-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin (the \"Delek Permian Gathering Project\"). As of December 31, 2020, approximately 178 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational, however, additional costs pertaining to a pipeline connection that was not contributed to the Partnership continue to be incurred and are still subject to the terms of the DPG Management Agreement. The Partnership is also considered the operator for the project and is responsible for the oversight of the project design, procurement and construction of project segments and for providing other related services. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the DPG Management Agreement.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our segment performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n(i)volumes (including pipeline throughput and terminal volumes);\n(ii)contribution margin per barrel;\n(iii)operating and maintenance expenses;\n(iv)cost of materials and other; and\n(v)EBITDA and distributable cash flow (as such terms are defined below).\nVolumes\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil and refined products that we handle in our pipeline, transportation, terminalling, storage and marketing operations. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, intermediate and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Although Delek Holdings has committed to minimum volumes under certain of the commercial agreements, as described above, our results of operations will be impacted by:\n\u2022Delek Holdings' utilization of our assets in excess of its minimum volume commitments;\n\u2022our ability to identify and execute acquisitions and organic expansion projects and capture incremental volume increases from Delek Holdings or third parties;\n\u2022our ability to increase throughput volumes at our refined products terminals and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals;\n\u2022our ability to identify and serve new customers in our marketing and trucking operations; and\n\u2022our ability to make connections to third-party facilities and pipelines.\nContribution Margin per Barrel\nBecause we do not allocate general and administrative expenses by segment, we measure the performance of our segments by the amount of contribution margin as generated in operations. Contribution margin is defined as net revenues less cost of materials and other and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization.\nFor our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, we also measure gross margin per barrel. Gross margin per barrel reflects the gross margin (net revenues less cost of materials and other) of the wholesale marketing operations divided by the number of barrels of refined products sold during the measurement period. Both contribution margin and gross margin per barrel can be affected by fluctuations in the prices and cost of gasoline, distillate fuel, ethanol and Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"). Historically, the profitability of our wholesale marketing operations has been affected by commodity price volatility, (specifically as it relates to changes in the price of refined products between the time we purchase such products from our suppliers and the time we sell the products to our wholesale customers), and the fluctuation in the value of RINs. Commodity price volatility may also impact our wholesale marketing operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price. Our wholesale marketing gross margin may also be impacted by the fixed price ethanol agreements we enter into to fix the price we pay for ethanol.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses include the costs associated with the operation of owned terminals and pipelines and terminalling expenses at third-party locations, excluding depreciation and amortization. These costs primarily include outside services, allocated employee costs, repairs and maintenance costs and energy and utility costs. Operating expenses related to the wholesale business are excluded from cost of sales because they primarily relate to costs associated with selling the products through our wholesale business. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of said expenses. Additionally, compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety may require us to incur additional expenditures. We will seek to manage our maintenance expenditures on our pipelines and terminals by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCost of Materials and Other\nThese costs include:\n(i)all costs of purchased refined products in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, as well as additives and related transportation of such products;\n(ii)costs associated with the operation of our trucking assets, which primarily include allocated employee costs and other costs related to fuel, truck leases and repairs and maintenance;\n(iii)the cost of pipeline capacity leased from any third parties; and\n(iv)gains and losses related to our commodity hedging activities.\nFinancing\nThe Partnership paid a cash distribution to its unitholders at a distribution rate of $0.910 per unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 ($3.64 per unit on an annualized basis). Our Partnership Agreement requires that the Partnership distribute all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) to its unitholders quarterly. As a result, the Partnership expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily from operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any potential future issuances of equity and debt securities. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of historic cash distributions.\nMarket Trends\nBusiness Environment\nFluctuations in crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products impact our operations and the operations of other master limited partnerships in the midstream energy sector. In particular, crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products have the ability to influence drilling activity in many basins and the amounts of capital spending that crude oil exploration and production companies incur to support future growth. Throughout the majority of 2018, the prices of crude oil and related refined products remained relatively consistent. Nevertheless, during the fourth quarter of 2018 the prices of crude oil and related refined products decreased significantly due to seasonal impacts. During the first half of 2019, the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased but fell slightly in the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, reduced demand for crude oil and refined products related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, combined with production increases from OPEC+, led to a significant reduction in crude oil prices. While OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut oil production, the uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic continues to slow down the recovery of demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, the downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future. Oil prices have been extremely volatile during the year ended December 31, 2020. The January 2020 high closing price of oil (WTI Cushing) was $63.27 per barrel, which declined to close at $20.48 per barrel on March 31, 2020, reached a second quarter 2020 low of $10.01 per barrel on April 21, 2020 and closed at $39.27 per barrel on June 30, 2020. The WTI Cushing oil price recovered slightly to close at $40.22 per barrel on September 30, 2020 and at $48.40 on December 31, 2020. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, some companies in the Permian Basin acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter and continued into the second and third quarter of 2020. The current market conditions have resulted in lower refinery utilization which in turn has impacted the throughput for our assets and operations. This has impacted our operations leading to a decrease in revenues albeit with at least an equivalent decrease in cost and expenses in some instances. Due to the stabilization in oil prices, albeit at lower prices, during the second half of the year, we experienced improved margins in the West Texas area, and better throughput for our assets with improved gross margins, when compared to the first half of 2020. We believe we are strategically positioned, in these tougher market conditions, to continue developing profitable growth projects that are needed to support future distribution growth in the midstream energy sector and for the Partnership.\nWest Texas Marketing Operations\nOverall demand for gathering and terminalling services in a particular area is generally driven by crude oil production in the area, which can be impacted by crude oil prices, refining economics and access to alternate delivery and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, volatility in crude oil, intermediate and refined products prices in the West Texas area and the value attributable to RINs can affect the results of our West Texas operations. For example, as discussed above, drilling activity and the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased in the first half of 2019 and in spite of a slight decrease in prices in the third quarter of 2019, demand for refined products from our West Texas operations to industries that support crude oil exploration and production began to rebound early in the first quarter of 2020. However due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic there was lower demand and sales of refined products during later part of the first quarter and remained down during the second quarter of 2020. However, during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020, demand and sales of the refined products began to rebound from the second quarter lows.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSee chart below for the high, low and average price per barrel of WTI crude oil for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlso, the volatility of refined products prices may impact our margin in the West Texas operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price.

These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n\u2022Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, including amortization of customer contract intangible assets, which is included as a component of net revenues in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n\u2022Distributable cash flow - calculated as net cash flow from\noperating activities plus or minus changes in assets and liabilities, less maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements and other adjustments not expected to settle in cash. Delek Logistics believes this is an appropriate reflection of a liquidity measure by which users of its financial statements can assess its ability to generate cash.\nEBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-U.S. GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other partnerships in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, please refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nResults of Operations\nA discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-lived Intangibles Impairment\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. An indicator exists when events or conditions indicate that it is more likely than not that the future cash flows associated with an asset group will be insufficient to recover the carrying value. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates, including salvage values (when applicable), from our historical experience and our internal business plans, which requires judgment. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the estimated recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset.\nIn late 2018, we began the process of decommissioning certain common carrier pipelines on the El Dorado Gathering System. The decommissioning entailed taking certain pipelines out of service in an effort to improve the safety and integrity of the El Dorado Gathering System. The project was completed in August 2019. The pipelines that were decommissioned remained physically in place, and the decommissioning did not have a material effect on our financial results. We performed an impairment analysis of our rights-of-ways (\"ROWs\") associated with the decommissioning project. As a result of the analysis, we determined that certain of the ROWs were impaired. This impairment, however, did not have a material effect on our 2019 financial results.\nWe have identified the COVID-19 Pandemic as a significant event during the year ended December 31, 2020 that adversely affected the global economy and the oil and gas industry. The COVID-19 Pandemic has resulted in government-imposed temporary business closures and shelter-at-home directives. This has had the secondary effect of impacting prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services. Additionally, the Pandemic has given rise to other identified uncertainties, as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. For these reasons, we have considered the uncertainties and the related risks in our consideration of the recoverability of Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original amortized book value instead of their higher fair value on acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum volume commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek Holdings, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on these factors and our judgments about their impact, we concluded that we did not have an indicator of impairment with respect to our property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. In response to the identified significant event relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we assessed whether the carrying amount of our Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles were recoverable by comparing the expected future cash flows to our carrying amount. Based on our analyses, we determined that the Property, plant and equipment of $464.8 million and definite-lived intangibles of $123.8 million were not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Potential Impairment\nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, provides that companies may first apply an optional qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is required to perform the quantitative impairment test. Alternatively, if a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it has completed its goodwill impairment test and does not need to perform the quantitative impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter.\nWhen applying the quantitative approach to assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"), estimated growth rates for revenue, barrels per day sold/throughput, rates including FERC regulated rates, contribution margin, capital expenditures, and long-term growth rate based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also corroborate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, sustained decrease in rates, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. The most significant risks to our valuation and the potential future impairment of goodwill are the WACC and the throughput and rates, which are mostly driven by the minimum throughput on our commercial agreements with Delek.\nBecause of the significant historical cushion by which the fair value of our reporting units exceeded our carrying value and the relative insignificance of our total goodwill balance ($12.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019) to our balance sheet as a whole, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our assessment was performed based on the events that had occurred through our annual assessment date, and included certain analyses on the most significant inputs in our most recent valuation model to evaluate the impact of these events on the fair value of our reporting units. This included sensitivity analysis and stress testing on certain of our inputs, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the barrel per day (\"BPD\") sold/throughput, which is driven by demand for crude oil and refined products. Except for West Texas, our throughput volume is primarily driven by the minimum throughput in our commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. Additionally, our 2020 assessment included consideration of the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, including its effect on the prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services (see further discussion of the Pandemic and related uncertainties as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis). Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original carrying amount instead of a higher fair value at acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum value commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on our annual assessment which involved these qualitative analyses, we determined that there was no indicator that fair value was more likely than not to have declined below carrying value of our reporting units as of our annual assessment dates during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Therefore, the quantitative approach was not required. Accordingly, our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, because conditions and events are rapidly changing, we continue to monitor developments with these events and their impact on our valuation. However, there is uncertainty in and around the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events that have not yet occurred or for existing conditions and events that may have future ramifications that cannot yet be anticipated. Continued or sustained adverse change to these factors may result in potential future impairment of some or all of our goodwill balance.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated results of operations and our segment operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands).

We have the ability to increase the DKL Credit Facility to $1.0 billion subject to receiving increased or new commitments from lenders and meeting certain requirements under the credit facility. Historically, we have generated adequate cash from operations to fund ongoing working capital requirements, pay quarterly cash distributions and operational capital expenditures, and we expect the same to continue in the foreseeable future. Other funding sources, including the issuance of additional debt securities, have been utilized to fund growth capital projects such as dropdowns. In addition, we have historically been able to source funding at rates that reflect market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings. We continue to monitor market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings and expect future funding sources to be at rates that are sustainable and profitable for the Partnership. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe believe we have sufficient financial resources from the above sources to meet our funding requirements in the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, quarterly cash distributions and capital expenditures. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy working capital requirements, to service our debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures, or to pay distributions will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the oil industry and other financial and business factors, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic and crude oil prices, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur largest customer is Delek Holdings, a related party, with whom we have various commercial agreements. Delek Holdings has initiated several steps as part of a strategic plan to navigate the current volatile markets and preserve or enhance its liquidity, including re-negotiating and extending financing arrangements, temporary suspension of growth and non-essential projects, reductions in capital and operating expenditures, divesting of non-strategic and underperfoming assets, suspension of its stock repurchases and dividends, and exploring other potential financing opportunities. We believe such actions will allow Delek Holdings to continue to honor its commercial agreements with us. In addition, we eliminated the IDRs which helped lower our cost of capital and preserve our liquidity.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to a significant decline in crude oil prices or uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our debt agreements. Management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic to enhance our liquidity position. Such actions include reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021, seeking alternative financing solutions and enacting cost reduction measures. Refer to the Business Overview section of this MD&A for a complete discussion of the uncertainties identified by management and the actions taken to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all our debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. After considering the current and potential effect of a significant decline in oil prices and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, we currently expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nCash Distributions\nOn January 22, 2021, we announced that the board of directors had declared a distribution of $0.910 per common unit (the \"Distribution\"), which equates to approximately $40 million per quarter, or $158.1 million per year, based on the number of common units outstanding as of February 2, 2021. The Distribution was paid on February 9, 2021 to common unitholders of record on February 2, 2021 and represents a 2.8% increase over the fourth quarter 2019 distribution. We have set a range for distribution growth guidance of $0.005 - $0.015 per unit each quarter for 2021. This increase in the distribution is consistent with our intent to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Although our Partnership Agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per common unit.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below summarizes the quarterly distributions related to our 2020 quarterly financial results:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended </td> <td>Total Quarterly Distribution Per Limited Partner Unit </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Quarterly Distribution Per Limited Partner Unit, Annualized </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Cash Distribution, including general partner interest and IDRs (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td>Unitholders Record Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td>$0.890 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.56 </td> <td> </td> <td>$30,878 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 5, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td>$0.900 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.60 </td> <td> </td> <td>$35,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 7, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td>$0.905 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.62 </td> <td> </td> <td>$39,308 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$0.910 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.64 </td> <td> </td> <td>$39,533 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 9, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2021 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>193,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(123,138) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(147,416) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(71,180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,302) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower cash paid out to suppliers for inventory (as opposed to cash received from customers) during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a decrease in volumes sold for the marketing operations. In addition there were decreases in operational expense payments and increase in cash dividends from the Equity Method Investments. These cash flow increases were offset by the decrease in net cash receipts from customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $24.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower contributions to equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the acquisition of the Big Spring Gathering Assets and Trucking Assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We disbursed $12.2 million in additional contributions to our equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $139.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was partially financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $100.0 million and the Trucking Assets Acquisition was financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $48.0 million of which $0.5 million was recorded as investing activity with $47.6 million recorded in financing activities as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance. Transaction costs paid amounting to $1.0 million were capitalized for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition. There was no asset acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition there were additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $13.3 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $9.1 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the $47.6 million excess of purchase consideration over the carrying amount of the assets acquired in the Trucking Assets Acquisition treated as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance and $45.0 million paid to the general partner in the IDR Restructuring Transaction to eliminate the general partners' IDRs, convert the general partners economic interest to non-economic interest and issue 14.0 million common limited units. This was partially offset by the increase in net proceeds under the revolving credit facility (defined below). We received net proceeds of $158.2 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net proceeds of $131.7 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\npaid quarterly cash distributions totaling $136.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to quarterly cash distributions totaling $113.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe sources of cash to finance the asset acquisitions from Delek Holdings during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of the $100.0 million drawdown under the DKL Credit Facility to part-finance the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and $48.0 million drawdown to finance the Trucking Asset Acquisition. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was also financed by the issuance of 5.0 million units to Delek US Energy, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Delek US Holdings, Inc.).\nDebt Overview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $992.3 million comprised of $746.6 million under the amended and restated senior secured revolving agreement (the \"DKL Credit Facility\") and $245.7 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), the latter net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. Deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the 2025 Notes amounted to $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase of $159.2 million in our long-term debt balance compared to the balance at December 31, 2019 resulted from the borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility in 2020, primarily driven by the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Trucking Assets Acquisition, the IDR restructuring and amortization of the deferred financing costs and original issuance discount under our 2025 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness consisted of:\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $746.6 million under the Delek Logistics Credit Facility (\"revolving credit facility\"), due on September 28, 2023, with average borrowing rate of 2.44%.\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $245.7 million, under the Delek Logistics Notes (6.75% senior notes), due in 2025, with an effective interest rate of 7.45%.\nIn September 2018 the DKL Credit Facility was amended to, among other changes, increase the lender commitments from $700 million to $850 million. The obligations under the DKL Credit Facility remain secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Partnership's and its subsidiaries' tangible and intangible assets. Additionally, Delek Marketing, a subsidiary of Delek Holdings, had provided a limited guaranty of the Partnership's obligations under the DKL Credit Facility. Delek Marketing's guaranty was (i) limited to an amount equal to the principal amount, plus unpaid and accrued interest, of a promissory note made by Delek Holdings in favor of Delek Marketing (the \"Holdings Note\") and (ii) secured by Delek Marketing's pledge of the Holdings Note to the lenders under the DKL Credit Facility. Effective March 30, 2020, Delek Marketing's limited guaranty and pledge of the Holdings Note was terminated pursuant to a guaranty and pledge release approved by the required lenders under the DKL Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the IDR Restructuring Transaction, the Partnership entered into a First Amendment to the DKL Credit Facility (the \"First Amendment\") which, among other things, permitted the exchange of the IDRs and the general partner interest in the Partnership for the noneconomic general partner interest, the newly issued limited partner interests in the Partnership, plus $45.0 million in cash. The First Amendment also modified the total leverage and senior leverage ratios (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) calculations to reduce the total funded debt (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) component thereof by the total amount of unrestricted consolidated cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of the Partnership and its subsidiaries up to $20.0 million.\nThe DKL Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 28, 2023. Borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at either a U.S. dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. Borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars bear interest at either a Canadian dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the facility was approximately 2.44%. Additionally, the DKL Credit Facility requires us to pay a leverage ratio dependent quarterly fee on the average unused revolving commitment. As of December 31, 2020, this fee was 0.35% per year.\nOn May 23, 2017, the Partnership and Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership ( Finance Corp.\u201d and together with the Partnership, the Issuers\u201d), issued the 2025 Notes at a discount. The 2025 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, commencing November 15, 2017.\nBeginning on May 15, 2020, the Issuers may, subject to certain conditions and limitations, redeem all or part of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price of 105.063% of the redeemed principal for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2020, 103.375% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2021, 101.688% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2022 and 100.00% beginning on May 15, 2023 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In the event of a change of control, accompanied or followed by a ratings downgrade within a certain period of time, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the Issuers will be obligated to make an offer for the purchase of the 2025 Notes from holders at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn April 25, 2018, we made an offer to exchange the 2025 Notes and the related guarantees that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for an equal principal amount of exchange notes that are freely tradeable, as required under the terms of the original indenture.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe terms of the exchange notes that were issued in May 2018 as a result of the exchange (also referred to as the \"2025 Notes\") are substantially identical to the terms of the original 2025 Notes.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nAgreements Governing Certain Indebtedness of Delek Holdings\nAlthough we are not contractually bound by and are not liable for Delek Holdings' debt under its credit arrangements, we are indirectly affected by certain prohibitions and limitations contained therein. Specifically, certain of Delek Holdings' credit arrangements require that Delek Holdings meet certain minimum covenant levels for (i) consolidated shareholders' equity and (ii) a ratio of consolidated shareholders' equity to adjusted total assets. Delek Holdings, due to its majority ownership and control of our general partner, has the ability to prevent us from taking actions that would cause Delek Holdings to violate these and any other covenants in its credit arrangements or otherwise be in default under any of its credit arrangements. As a result we cannot assure you that such covenants will not impact our ability to use the full capacity under our revolving credit facility in the future. Please read Item 1A. \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness, the terms of its borrowings and any future credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business, our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our credit profile. Our current and future credit ratings may also be affected by Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness and financial performance and credit ratings.\u201d\nEquity Units Overview\nOn August 13, 2020, we closed the IDR Restructuring Transaction. To effect this transaction, our Partnership Agreement was amended and updated. See Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement, which subsequently became effective, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed re-sale or disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nOn March 31, 2020, we issued 5.0 million common limited partner units to Delek Holdings as part of the consideration for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition. In connection with the issuance of these units and in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, we issued additional general partner units in an amount necessary to maintain the 2% general partner interest as defined in the Partnership Agreement.\nContemporaneous with the above issuance, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the IDRs associated with the 5.0 million Additional Units for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The IDR Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Spending\nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program.

Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures for the repair, refurbishment and replacement of pipelines and terminals, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Delek Holdings has agreed to reimburse us with respect to certain assets it has transferred to us pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n(2) The $5.4 million budgeted for regulatory projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on certain of our pipelines to maintain their operational integrity. The majority of the $6.9 million for discretionary projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on scheduled maintenance and improvements to certain of our tanks and development of our DPG assets. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(3) The majority of the $3.6 million and $2.2 million budgeted for regulatory and maintenance projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment relates to scheduled maintenance and improvements on our terminalling tanks and racks at certain of our terminals. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(4) There is no spending budgeted for discretionary projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment due to the fact that the budget is focused on pursuing projects that are higher priority in the regulatory and maintenance category.\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects. For example, we may experience increases in the cost of and/or timing to obtain necessary equipment required for our continued compliance with government regulations or to complete improvement projects. Additionally, the scope and cost of employee or contractor labor expense related to installation of that equipment could increase from our projections.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nInformation regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below, as of December 31, 2020, is set forth in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td><1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>>5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt and notes payable\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>746,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>996,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>35,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,620 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Lease Obligation </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments (2)\n</td> <td>7,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>832,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,164,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes expected interest payments on debt balances outstanding under the DKL Credit Facility and the 2025 Notes at December 31, 2020.

With the exception of amounts classified as current, there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities in Notes 2 and 17, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is management's analysis of our financial performance and of significant trends that may affect our future performance.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Partnership primarily owns and operates crude oil, intermediate and refined products logistics and marketing assets. We gather, transport, offload and store crude oil and intermediate products and market, distribute, transport and store refined products primarily in select regions of the southeastern United States and Texas for Delek Holdings and third parties. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent upon the success of Delek Holdings' refining operations, as many of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek Holdings in support of its Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring refineries.\nThe Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview\" for further details.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 (the \"COVID-19 Pandemic\" or the \"Pandemic\") has resulted in significant economic disruption globally, including in the U.S. and specific geographic areas where we operate. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through both voluntary and mandated social distancing, curfews, shutdowns and expanded safety measures, have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use, leading to a substantial decrease in consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic which caused reduced consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons during the year ended December 31, 2020 in the United States and globally. Therefore, downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2020, governmental authorities in various states across the U.S., particularly those states in our Permian Basin and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, lifted many of the restrictions created by actions taken to slow down the spread of COVID-19. These actions resulted in an increase in the level of individual movement and travel and, in turn, an increase in the demand and market prices for some of our products relative to late March 2020. However, many of the states where such restrictions were lifted subsequently experienced a marked increase in the spread of COVID-19 and many governmental authorities in such areas responded by re-imposing certain restrictions they had previously lifted. In addition, certain countries globally recently re-imposed previously lifted restrictions due to worsening effects of the increased spread of COVID-19. This response, as well as the increased infection rates, impacts regions that we serve and could significantly impact demand in ways that we cannot predict. Additionally, increased infection rates could impact our logistics operations, particularly in high-infection states, if our employees are personally affected by the illness, both through direct infection and quarantine procedures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, both our West Texas wholesale marketing business and many of our pipeline and transportation customers have experienced the impact on demand and pricing of these unprecedented conditions. Our pipelines and transportation revenue streams were largely protected by minimum commitments under existing throughput contracts with customers during the current period, but continued pressure on our customers could present risks to our existing and new business opportunities as well as on collectability on our receivables. We continue to experience operational constraints as well, including COVID-19 infections at certain of our company locations that have resulted in re-imposed or expanded remote policies and quarantine protocols. We continue to be faced with risk from our suppliers and customers who are facing similar challenges.\nWe have identified the following uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, including the impact related to crude storage space shortages:\n\u2022Customers directly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events in terms of demand for refined product may reduce throughputs which could, likewise, impact the throughput demand for our pipelines, and may seek to renegotiate minimums under contractual force majeure provisions. Such reductions could have a significant impact on our revenues, cost of sales, operating income and liquidity, as well to the carrying value of long-lived or indefinite-lived assets;\n\u2022Customers may experience financial difficulties which could interrupt the volumes ordered by those customers and/or could impact the credit worthiness of such customers and the collectability of their outstanding receivables;\n\u2022Equity method investees may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and/or other events, which may increase the risk of impairment of those investments;\n 53 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022The decline in demand and pricing on our wholesale marketing segment and a decline in demand for pipelines and transportation impacting current results and/or forecasts could result in impairments in certain of our long-lived or indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, or have other financial statement impacts that cannot currently be anticipated;\n\u2022While our current liquidity needs are managed by existing credit facilities, sources of future liquidity needs may be impacted by the volatility in the debt market and the availability and pricing of such funds as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events; and\n\u2022The U.S. Federal Government has enacted certain stimulus and relief measures and is continuing to consider additional relief legislation. To the extent that the provisions do not directly impact the Partnership in the current period or are intended to stimulate or provide relief to the greater U.S. economy and/or consumer, the impact and success of such efforts remains unknown.\nOther uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events may exist that have not been identified or that are not specifically listed above, and could impact our future results of operations and financial position, the nature of which and the extent to which are currently unknown. Actions taken by OPEC+ in April and June 2020, including the agreement for management of crude oil supply in the hopes of contributing to market stabilization (the \"Oil Production Cuts\"), as well as the U.S. Federal Government's passage and/or enactment of additional stimulus and relief measures, may impact the extent to which the risk underlying these uncertainties are realized. To the extent these uncertainties have been identified and are believed to have an impact on our current period results of operations or financial position based on the requirements for assessing such financial statement impact under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we have considered them in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events on our business. Such efforts include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\u2022Reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021;\n\u2022Identifying alternative financing solutions to enhance our access to sources of liquidity;\n\u2022Enacting cost reduction measures across the organization, including reducing contract services, reducing overtime and reducing or eliminating non-critical travel which serves the dual purpose of also complying with recommendations made by the state and federal governments because of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022Implementing regular site cleaning and disinfecting procedures;\n\u2022Adopting remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, appropriate safety precautions taken; and\n\u2022Working with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure.\nThe extent to which our future results are affected by COVID-19 Pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the Pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. The COVID-19 Pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the Pandemic, could also exacerbate the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 Pandemic may also materially adversely affect our results in a manner that is either not currently known or that we do not currently consider to be a significant risk to our business.\nSee also 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nOur Reporting Segments and Assets\nOur business consists of two reportable segments:\n(i) Pipelines and Transportation\nThe assets and investments in our pipelines and transportation segment consist of pipelines, tanks, offloading facilities, trucks and ancillary assets, which provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services primarily in support of Delek Holdings' refining operations in Tyler, Texas, El Dorado, Arkansas and Big Spring, Texas. Additionally, the assets in this segment provide crude oil transportation services to certain third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store. Therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices with respect to this operating segment.\n(ii) Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling\nThe assets in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment consist of refined products terminals and pipelines in Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. We generate revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler and Big Spring refineries, engaging in wholesale activity at our terminals in West Texas and at\n 54 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nterminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and by providing terminalling services at our refined products terminals to independent third parties and Delek Holdings.\n2020 Developments\nRestructuring Transaction\nEffective August 13, 2020, the Partnership closed the transaction contemplated by a definitive exchange agreement with the general partner to eliminate all of the IDRs held by the general partner and convert the 2% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest, both in exchange for 14.0 million newly issued common limited partner units and $45.0 million in cash (the \"IDR Restructuring Transaction\"). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which subsequently became effective, for the proposed re-sale or other disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nRed River Expansion project\nIn August 2020, Red River, a joint venture equity method investment which owns a crude oil pipeline running from Cushing, Oklahoma to Longview, Texas, completed a planned expansion project to increase the pipeline capacity from 150,000 bpd to 235,000 bpd. The expansion project commenced operations on October 1, 2020.\nInflation Adjustments\nOn July 1, 2020, the tariffs on our FERC regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties that are subject to adjustment using the FERC indexing increased by approximately 2%, which was the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties, the fee adjusted based on the consumer price index increased 1.6% and the fees adjusted based on producer price index decreased approximately 1.2%. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview-2020 Developments\" for further details.\nTrucking Assets Acquisition\nEffective May 1, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Transportation, LLC, acquired Delek Trucking, LLC consisting of certain leased and owned tractors and trailers and related assets from Delek Holdings. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBig Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Permian Gathering, LLC, acquired the Big Spring Gathering Assets from Delek Holdings, located in Howard, Borden and Martin Counties, Texas. See Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIDR Waiver\nOn March 31, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights (\"IDRs\") associated with the 5.0 million newly issued common limited partner units (\"Additional Units\") for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBusiness Strategies\nOur objectives are to maintain stable cash flows and to grow the quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders over time. We are focused on growing our asset base within our geographic area through acquisitions, project development, joint ventures and enhancing our existing systems. While we will continue to evaluate ways to provide Delek Holdings with logistics services, our emphasis will be to increase the logistics services that we offer to third parties. We intend to achieve these objectives through the following business strategies:\n\u2022Generate Stable Cash Flow. We will continue to pursue opportunities to provide logistics, marketing and other services to Delek Holdings and third parties pursuant to long-term, fee-based contracts. In new service contracts, we will endeavor to include minimum volume throughput or other commitments, similar to those included in our current commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\n 55 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022Focus on Growing Our Business. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to grow our business through both strategic acquisitions and expansion and construction projects, both internally funded or in combination with potential external partners and through investments in joint ventures. Additionally, we believe that our strong relationship with Delek Holdings will enhance our opportunities to grow our business.\n\u25e6Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that both complement our existing assets and provide attractive returns for our unitholders. As we continue to grow through acquisitions, we believe we will be able to increase our third party business. In addition to those opportunities to acquire assets from Delek Holdings described below, we believe that our current asset base, and our knowledge of the regional markets in which we operate, will enable us to target and complete attractive third-party acquisitions.\n\u25e6Investments in Joint Ventures. We have grown our asset base to include investments in joint ventures, which have contributed to our initiative to grow our midstream business, while increasing our crude oil sourcing flexibility. We intend to continue evaluating growth opportunities through these investments.\n\u2022Engage in Mutually Beneficial Transactions with Delek Holdings. Delek Holdings has granted us a right of first offer on certain logistics assets. We intend to review our right to purchase any such assets as they are offered to us under the terms of the right of first offer, from time to time. Delek Holdings is also required, under certain circumstances, to offer us the opportunity to purchase additional logistics assets that Delek Holdings may acquire or construct in the future. Further, we anticipate additional growth opportunities through subsequent dropdowns of logistics assets acquired or developed by Delek Holdings. For example, Delek Holdings anticipates offering us certain gathering and logistics assets. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such transaction or whether or on what terms dropdowns will be offered to us by Delek Holdings. We continue to evaluate options with respect to dropdown transactions, which may include changes in capital structure.\n\u25e6Pursue Attractive Expansion and Construction Opportunities. We intend to pursue organic growth opportunities that complement our existing businesses or that provide attractive returns within or outside our current geographic footprint. We plan to evaluate potential opportunities to make capital investments that will be used to expand our existing asset base through the expansion and construction of new logistics assets to support growth of any of our customers', including Delek Holdings', businesses and from increased third-party activity. These construction projects may be developed either through joint venture relationships or by us acting independently, depending on size and scale.\n\u2022Optimize Our Existing Assets and Expand Our Customer Base. We seek to enhance the profitability of our existing assets by adding incremental throughput volumes, improving operating efficiencies and increasing system-wide utilization. We also expect to further diversify our customer base by increasing third-party throughput volumes running through certain of our existing systems and expanding our existing asset portfolio to service more third-party customers.\nCommercial Agreements with Delek Holdings\nThe Partnership has a number of long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Delek Holdings under which we provide various services, including crude oil gathering, crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services, and marketing, terminalling and offloading services to Delek Holdings, and Delek Holdings commits to provide us with minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil, intermediate and refined products. Generally, these agreements include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments and have tariffs or fees indexed to inflation-based indices, provided that the tariffs or fees will not be decreased below the initial amount. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\nOther Transactions\nStarting in 2018, the Partnership manages a long-term capital project on behalf of Delek Holdings pursuant to a construction management and operating agreement (the \"DPG Management Agreement\") for the construction of a 250-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin (the \"Delek Permian Gathering Project\"). As of December 31, 2020, approximately 178 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational, however, additional costs pertaining to a pipeline connection that was not contributed to the Partnership continue to be incurred and are still subject to the terms of the DPG Management Agreement. The Partnership is also considered the operator for the project and is responsible for the oversight of the project design, procurement and construction of project segments and for providing other related services. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the DPG Management Agreement.\n 56 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our segment performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n(i)volumes (including pipeline throughput and terminal volumes);\n(ii)contribution margin per barrel;\n(iii)operating and maintenance expenses;\n(iv)cost of materials and other; and\n(v)EBITDA and distributable cash flow (as such terms are defined below).\nVolumes\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil and refined products that we handle in our pipeline, transportation, terminalling, storage and marketing operations. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, intermediate and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Although Delek Holdings has committed to minimum volumes under certain of the commercial agreements, as described above, our results of operations will be impacted by:\n\u2022Delek Holdings' utilization of our assets in excess of its minimum volume commitments;\n\u2022our ability to identify and execute acquisitions and organic expansion projects and capture incremental volume increases from Delek Holdings or third parties;\n\u2022our ability to increase throughput volumes at our refined products terminals and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals;\n\u2022our ability to identify and serve new customers in our marketing and trucking operations; and\n\u2022our ability to make connections to third-party facilities and pipelines.\nContribution Margin per Barrel\nBecause we do not allocate general and administrative expenses by segment, we measure the performance of our segments by the amount of contribution margin as generated in operations. Contribution margin is defined as net revenues less cost of materials and other and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization.\nFor our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, we also measure gross margin per barrel. Gross margin per barrel reflects the gross margin (net revenues less cost of materials and other) of the wholesale marketing operations divided by the number of barrels of refined products sold during the measurement period. Both contribution margin and gross margin per barrel can be affected by fluctuations in the prices and cost of gasoline, distillate fuel, ethanol and Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"). Historically, the profitability of our wholesale marketing operations has been affected by commodity price volatility, (specifically as it relates to changes in the price of refined products between the time we purchase such products from our suppliers and the time we sell the products to our wholesale customers), and the fluctuation in the value of RINs. Commodity price volatility may also impact our wholesale marketing operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price. Our wholesale marketing gross margin may also be impacted by the fixed price ethanol agreements we enter into to fix the price we pay for ethanol.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses include the costs associated with the operation of owned terminals and pipelines and terminalling expenses at third-party locations, excluding depreciation and amortization. These costs primarily include outside services, allocated employee costs, repairs and maintenance costs and energy and utility costs. Operating expenses related to the wholesale business are excluded from cost of sales because they primarily relate to costs associated with selling the products through our wholesale business. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of said expenses. Additionally, compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety may require us to incur additional expenditures. We will seek to manage our maintenance expenditures on our pipelines and terminals by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\n 57 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCost of Materials and Other\nThese costs include:\n(i)all costs of purchased refined products in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, as well as additives and related transportation of such products;\n(ii)costs associated with the operation of our trucking assets, which primarily include allocated employee costs and other costs related to fuel, truck leases and repairs and maintenance;\n(iii)the cost of pipeline capacity leased from any third parties; and\n(iv)gains and losses related to our commodity hedging activities.\nFinancing\nThe Partnership paid a cash distribution to its unitholders at a distribution rate of $0.910 per unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 ($3.64 per unit on an annualized basis). Our Partnership Agreement requires that the Partnership distribute all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) to its unitholders quarterly. As a result, the Partnership expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily from operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any potential future issuances of equity and debt securities. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of historic cash distributions.\nMarket Trends\nBusiness Environment\nFluctuations in crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products impact our operations and the operations of other master limited partnerships in the midstream energy sector. In particular, crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products have the ability to influence drilling activity in many basins and the amounts of capital spending that crude oil exploration and production companies incur to support future growth. Throughout the majority of 2018, the prices of crude oil and related refined products remained relatively consistent. Nevertheless, during the fourth quarter of 2018 the prices of crude oil and related refined products decreased significantly due to seasonal impacts. During the first half of 2019, the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased but fell slightly in the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, reduced demand for crude oil and refined products related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, combined with production increases from OPEC+, led to a significant reduction in crude oil prices. While OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut oil production, the uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic continues to slow down the recovery of demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, the downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future. Oil prices have been extremely volatile during the year ended December 31, 2020. The January 2020 high closing price of oil (WTI Cushing) was $63.27 per barrel, which declined to close at $20.48 per barrel on March 31, 2020, reached a second quarter 2020 low of $10.01 per barrel on April 21, 2020 and closed at $39.27 per barrel on June 30, 2020. The WTI Cushing oil price recovered slightly to close at $40.22 per barrel on September 30, 2020 and at $48.40 on December 31, 2020. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, some companies in the Permian Basin acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter and continued into the second and third quarter of 2020. The current market conditions have resulted in lower refinery utilization which in turn has impacted the throughput for our assets and operations. This has impacted our operations leading to a decrease in revenues albeit with at least an equivalent decrease in cost and expenses in some instances. Due to the stabilization in oil prices, albeit at lower prices, during the second half of the year, we experienced improved margins in the West Texas area, and better throughput for our assets with improved gross margins, when compared to the first half of 2020. We believe we are strategically positioned, in these tougher market conditions, to continue developing profitable growth projects that are needed to support future distribution growth in the midstream energy sector and for the Partnership.\nWest Texas Marketing Operations\nOverall demand for gathering and terminalling services in a particular area is generally driven by crude oil production in the area, which can be impacted by crude oil prices, refining economics and access to alternate delivery and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, volatility in crude oil, intermediate and refined products prices in the West Texas area and the value attributable to RINs can affect the results of our West Texas operations. For example, as discussed above, drilling activity and the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased in the first half of 2019 and in spite of a slight decrease in prices in the third quarter of 2019, demand for refined products from our West Texas operations to industries that support crude oil exploration and production began to rebound early in the first quarter of 2020. However due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic there was lower demand and sales of refined products during later part of the first quarter and remained down during the second quarter of 2020. However, during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020, demand and sales of the refined products began to rebound from the second quarter lows.\n 58 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSee chart below for the high, low and average price per barrel of WTI crude oil for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \nAlso, the volatility of refined products prices may impact our margin in the West Texas operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price. See below for the range of prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n 59 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \nOur West Texas operations can benefit from RINs that are generated by ethanol blending activities. As a result, changes in the price of RINs can affect our results of operations. The RINs we generate are sold primarily to Delek Holdings at market prices. We sold approximately $3.4 million and $1.2 million of RINs to Delek Holdings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See below for the high, low and average prices of RINs for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \nAll of these factors are subject to change over time. As part of our overall business strategy, management considers aspects such as location, acquisition and expansion opportunities and factors impacting the utilization of the refineries (and therefore throughput volumes), which may impact our performance in the market.\n 60 \nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain \"non-GAAP\" operational measures to evaluate our operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n\u2022Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, including amortization of customer contract intangible assets, which is included as a component of net revenues in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n\u2022Distributable cash flow - calculated as net cash flow from\noperating activities plus or minus changes in assets and liabilities, less maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements and other adjustments not expected to settle in cash. Delek Logistics believes this is an appropriate reflection of a liquidity measure by which users of its financial statements can assess its ability to generate cash.\nEBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-U.S. GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other partnerships in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, please refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n 61 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nResults of Operations\nA discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The financial statements, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, or net income and net cash from operating activities, respectively.\nReconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in thousands)\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,749 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>35,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,701 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of customer contract intangible assets </td> <td>7,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>42,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,328 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>245,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,956 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nReconciliation of net cash from operating activities to distributable cash flow (in thousands)\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in assets and liabilities </td> <td>19,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(571) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions from equity method investments in investing activities </td> <td>2,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash lease expense </td> <td>(6,075) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(193) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures (2)\n</td> <td>(1,296) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,569) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reimbursement from Delek Holdings for capital expenditures (3)\n</td> <td>263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of asset retirement obligations </td> <td>(427) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(397) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred income taxes </td> <td>(401) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(496) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating income, net </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributable cash flow (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,002 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For a definition of EBITDA and distributable cash flow, please see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" above. (2) Maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures represent cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets, and for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures are expenditures for the repair, refurbishment and replacement of pipelines and terminals, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. (3) For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Delek Holdings reimbursed us for certain capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements). \n \n 62 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-lived Intangibles Impairment\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. An indicator exists when events or conditions indicate that it is more likely than not that the future cash flows associated with an asset group will be insufficient to recover the carrying value. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates, including salvage values (when applicable), from our historical experience and our internal business plans, which requires judgment. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the estimated recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset.\nIn late 2018, we began the process of decommissioning certain common carrier pipelines on the El Dorado Gathering System. The decommissioning entailed taking certain pipelines out of service in an effort to improve the safety and integrity of the El Dorado Gathering System. The project was completed in August 2019. The pipelines that were decommissioned remained physically in place, and the decommissioning did not have a material effect on our financial results. We performed an impairment analysis of our rights-of-ways (\"ROWs\") associated with the decommissioning project. As a result of the analysis, we determined that certain of the ROWs were impaired. This impairment, however, did not have a material effect on our 2019 financial results.\nWe have identified the COVID-19 Pandemic as a significant event during the year ended December 31, 2020 that adversely affected the global economy and the oil and gas industry. The COVID-19 Pandemic has resulted in government-imposed temporary business closures and shelter-at-home directives. This has had the secondary effect of impacting prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services. Additionally, the Pandemic has given rise to other identified uncertainties, as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. For these reasons, we have considered the uncertainties and the related risks in our consideration of the recoverability of Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original amortized book value instead of their higher fair value on acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum volume commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek Holdings, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on these factors and our judgments about their impact, we concluded that we did not have an indicator of impairment with respect to our property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. In response to the identified significant event relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we assessed whether the carrying amount of our Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles were recoverable by comparing the expected future cash flows to our carrying amount. Based on our analyses, we determined that the Property, plant and equipment of $464.8 million and definite-lived intangibles of $123.8 million were not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Potential Impairment\nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, provides that companies may first apply an optional qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is required to perform the quantitative impairment test. Alternatively, if a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more\n 63 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it has completed its goodwill impairment test and does not need to perform the quantitative impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter.\nWhen applying the quantitative approach to assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"), estimated growth rates for revenue, barrels per day sold/throughput, rates including FERC regulated rates, contribution margin, capital expenditures, and long-term growth rate based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also corroborate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, sustained decrease in rates, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. The most significant risks to our valuation and the potential future impairment of goodwill are the WACC and the throughput and rates, which are mostly driven by the minimum throughput on our commercial agreements with Delek.\nBecause of the significant historical cushion by which the fair value of our reporting units exceeded our carrying value and the relative insignificance of our total goodwill balance ($12.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019) to our balance sheet as a whole, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our assessment was performed based on the events that had occurred through our annual assessment date, and included certain analyses on the most significant inputs in our most recent valuation model to evaluate the impact of these events on the fair value of our reporting units. This included sensitivity analysis and stress testing on certain of our inputs, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the barrel per day (\"BPD\") sold/throughput, which is driven by demand for crude oil and refined products. Except for West Texas, our throughput volume is primarily driven by the minimum throughput in our commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. Additionally, our 2020 assessment included consideration of the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, including its effect on the prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services (see further discussion of the Pandemic and related uncertainties as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis). Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original carrying amount instead of a higher fair value at acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum value commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on our annual assessment which involved these qualitative analyses, we determined that there was no indicator that fair value was more likely than not to have declined below carrying value of our reporting units as of our annual assessment dates during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Therefore, the quantitative approach was not required. Accordingly, our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, because conditions and events are rapidly changing, we continue to monitor developments with these events and their impact on our valuation. However, there is uncertainty in and around the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events that have not yet occurred or for existing conditions and events that may have future ramifications that cannot yet be anticipated. Continued or sustained adverse change to these factors may result in potential future impairment of some or all of our goodwill balance.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\n 64 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated results of operations and our segment operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands).

and\n\u2022increased revenues at our El Dorado Assets and Magnolia Pipeline as result of increased throughput during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \nCost of Materials and Other\nCost of materials and other for the pipelines and transportation segment increased by $23.1 million, or 101.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022increases in transportation costs related to our trucking assets, including driver wages and benefits and fuel expense proportionate to increase in fees, insurance, supplies and maintenance expenses.\n \nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the pipelines and transportation segment decreased by $12.6 million, or 22.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decrease in employee and outside services costs due to measures implemented to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic including delaying non-essential projects.\n \nContribution Margin\nContribution margin for the pipelines and transportation segment increased by $62.6 million, or 62.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022increases in revenues associated with agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition, Magnolia Pipeline, and El Dorado Assets; and\n\u2022decreases in operating expenses.\n 68 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment\nWe use our wholesale marketing and terminalling assets to generate revenue by providing wholesale marketing and terminalling services to Delek Holdings' refining operations and to independent third parties.\nThe table and discussion below present the results of operations and certain operating statistics of the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Refer to the Refined Products Volume - Gallons chart above for a summary of volumes impacting our West Texas operations.\n 70 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased by $5.3 million, or 27.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022lower operating costs associated with allocated contract services pertaining to certain of our assets; and\n\u2022decreases in variable expenses such as utilities, maintenance and materials costs.\n \nContribution Margin\nContribution margin for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment increased by $2.1 million, or 2.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in cost of materials and other due to decreases in average cost per gallon of diesel and gasoline sold as described above.\nSuch decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022decreases in revenue due to decreases in average price per gallon of diesel and gasoline as described above.\n 71 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i) cash generated from operations;\n</td> <td>(iii) potential issuance of additional equity; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii) borrowings under our revolving credit facility;\n</td> <td>(iv) potential issuance of additional debt securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020 our total liquidity amounted to $107.6 million comprised of $103.4 million in unused credit commitments under the DKL Credit Facility and $4.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have the ability to increase the DKL Credit Facility to $1.0 billion subject to receiving increased or new commitments from lenders and meeting certain requirements under the credit facility. Historically, we have generated adequate cash from operations to fund ongoing working capital requirements, pay quarterly cash distributions and operational capital expenditures, and we expect the same to continue in the foreseeable future. Other funding sources, including the issuance of additional debt securities, have been utilized to fund growth capital projects such as dropdowns. In addition, we have historically been able to source funding at rates that reflect market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings. We continue to monitor market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings and expect future funding sources to be at rates that are sustainable and profitable for the Partnership. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe believe we have sufficient financial resources from the above sources to meet our funding requirements in the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, quarterly cash distributions and capital expenditures. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy working capital requirements, to service our debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures, or to pay distributions will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the oil industry and other financial and business factors, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic and crude oil prices, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur largest customer is Delek Holdings, a related party, with whom we have various commercial agreements. Delek Holdings has initiated several steps as part of a strategic plan to navigate the current volatile markets and preserve or enhance its liquidity, including re-negotiating and extending financing arrangements, temporary suspension of growth and non-essential projects, reductions in capital and operating expenditures, divesting of non-strategic and underperfoming assets, suspension of its stock repurchases and dividends, and exploring other potential financing opportunities. We believe such actions will allow Delek Holdings to continue to honor its commercial agreements with us. In addition, we eliminated the IDRs which helped lower our cost of capital and preserve our liquidity.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to a significant decline in crude oil prices or uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our debt agreements. Management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic to enhance our liquidity position. Such actions include reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021, seeking alternative financing solutions and enacting cost reduction measures. Refer to the Business Overview section of this MD&A for a complete discussion of the uncertainties identified by management and the actions taken to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all our debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. After considering the current and potential effect of a significant decline in oil prices and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, we currently expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nCash Distributions\nOn January 22, 2021, we announced that the board of directors had declared a distribution of $0.910 per common unit (the \"Distribution\"), which equates to approximately $40 million per quarter, or $158.1 million per year, based on the number of common units outstanding as of February 2, 2021. The Distribution was paid on February 9, 2021 to common unitholders of record on February 2, 2021 and represents a 2.8% increase over the fourth quarter 2019 distribution. We have set a range for distribution growth guidance of $0.005 - $0.015 per unit each quarter for 2021. This increase in the distribution is consistent with our intent to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Although our Partnership Agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per common unit.\n 72 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below summarizes the quarterly distributions related to our 2020 quarterly financial results:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended </td> <td>Total Quarterly Distribution Per Limited Partner Unit </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Quarterly Distribution Per Limited Partner Unit, Annualized </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Cash Distribution, including general partner interest and IDRs (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td>Unitholders Record Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td>$0.890 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.56 </td> <td> </td> <td>$30,878 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 5, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td>$0.900 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.60 </td> <td> </td> <td>$35,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 7, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td>$0.905 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.62 </td> <td> </td> <td>$39,308 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 6, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$0.910 </td> <td> </td> <td>$3.64 </td> <td> </td> <td>$39,533 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 9, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 2, 2021 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>193,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(123,138) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(147,416) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(71,180) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,302) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower cash paid out to suppliers for inventory (as opposed to cash received from customers) during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a decrease in volumes sold for the marketing operations. In addition there were decreases in operational expense payments and increase in cash dividends from the Equity Method Investments. These cash flow increases were offset by the decrease in net cash receipts from customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $24.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower contributions to equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the acquisition of the Big Spring Gathering Assets and Trucking Assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We disbursed $12.2 million in additional contributions to our equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $139.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was partially financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $100.0 million and the Trucking Assets Acquisition was financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $48.0 million of which $0.5 million was recorded as investing activity with $47.6 million recorded in financing activities as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance. Transaction costs paid amounting to $1.0 million were capitalized for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition. There was no asset acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition there were additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $13.3 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $9.1 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the $47.6 million excess of purchase consideration over the carrying amount of the assets acquired in the Trucking Assets Acquisition treated as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance and $45.0 million paid to the general partner in the IDR Restructuring Transaction to eliminate the general partners' IDRs, convert the general partners economic interest to non-economic interest and issue 14.0 million common limited units. This was partially offset by the increase in net proceeds under the revolving credit facility (defined below). We received net proceeds of $158.2 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net proceeds of $131.7 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we\n 73 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\npaid quarterly cash distributions totaling $136.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to quarterly cash distributions totaling $113.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe sources of cash to finance the asset acquisitions from Delek Holdings during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of the $100.0 million drawdown under the DKL Credit Facility to part-finance the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and $48.0 million drawdown to finance the Trucking Asset Acquisition. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was also financed by the issuance of 5.0 million units to Delek US Energy, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Delek US Holdings, Inc.).\nDebt Overview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $992.3 million comprised of $746.6 million under the amended and restated senior secured revolving agreement (the \"DKL Credit Facility\") and $245.7 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), the latter net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. Deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the 2025 Notes amounted to $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase of $159.2 million in our long-term debt balance compared to the balance at December 31, 2019 resulted from the borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility in 2020, primarily driven by the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Trucking Assets Acquisition, the IDR restructuring and amortization of the deferred financing costs and original issuance discount under our 2025 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness consisted of:\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $746.6 million under the Delek Logistics Credit Facility (\"revolving credit facility\"), due on September 28, 2023, with average borrowing rate of 2.44%.\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $245.7 million, under the Delek Logistics Notes (6.75% senior notes), due in 2025, with an effective interest rate of 7.45%.\nIn September 2018 the DKL Credit Facility was amended to, among other changes, increase the lender commitments from $700 million to $850 million. The obligations under the DKL Credit Facility remain secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Partnership's and its subsidiaries' tangible and intangible assets. Additionally, Delek Marketing, a subsidiary of Delek Holdings, had provided a limited guaranty of the Partnership's obligations under the DKL Credit Facility. Delek Marketing's guaranty was (i) limited to an amount equal to the principal amount, plus unpaid and accrued interest, of a promissory note made by Delek Holdings in favor of Delek Marketing (the \"Holdings Note\") and (ii) secured by Delek Marketing's pledge of the Holdings Note to the lenders under the DKL Credit Facility. Effective March 30, 2020, Delek Marketing's limited guaranty and pledge of the Holdings Note was terminated pursuant to a guaranty and pledge release approved by the required lenders under the DKL Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the IDR Restructuring Transaction, the Partnership entered into a First Amendment to the DKL Credit Facility (the \"First Amendment\") which, among other things, permitted the exchange of the IDRs and the general partner interest in the Partnership for the noneconomic general partner interest, the newly issued limited partner interests in the Partnership, plus $45.0 million in cash. The First Amendment also modified the total leverage and senior leverage ratios (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) calculations to reduce the total funded debt (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) component thereof by the total amount of unrestricted consolidated cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of the Partnership and its subsidiaries up to $20.0 million.\nThe DKL Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 28, 2023. Borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at either a U.S. dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. Borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars bear interest at either a Canadian dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the facility was approximately 2.44%. Additionally, the DKL Credit Facility requires us to pay a leverage ratio dependent quarterly fee on the average unused revolving commitment. As of December 31, 2020, this fee was 0.35% per year.\nOn May 23, 2017, the Partnership and Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership ( Finance Corp.\u201d and together with the Partnership, the Issuers\u201d), issued the 2025 Notes at a discount. The 2025 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, commencing November 15, 2017.\nBeginning on May 15, 2020, the Issuers may, subject to certain conditions and limitations, redeem all or part of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price of 105.063% of the redeemed principal for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2020, 103.375% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2021, 101.688% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2022 and 100.00% beginning on May 15, 2023 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In the event of a change of control, accompanied or followed by a ratings downgrade within a certain period of time, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the Issuers will be obligated to make an offer for the purchase of the 2025 Notes from holders at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn April 25, 2018, we made an offer to exchange the 2025 Notes and the related guarantees that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for an equal principal amount of exchange notes that are freely tradeable, as required under the terms of the original indenture.\n 74 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe terms of the exchange notes that were issued in May 2018 as a result of the exchange (also referred to as the \"2025 Notes\") are substantially identical to the terms of the original 2025 Notes.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nAgreements Governing Certain Indebtedness of Delek Holdings\nAlthough we are not contractually bound by and are not liable for Delek Holdings' debt under its credit arrangements, we are indirectly affected by certain prohibitions and limitations contained therein. Specifically, certain of Delek Holdings' credit arrangements require that Delek Holdings meet certain minimum covenant levels for (i) consolidated shareholders' equity and (ii) a ratio of consolidated shareholders' equity to adjusted total assets. Delek Holdings, due to its majority ownership and control of our general partner, has the ability to prevent us from taking actions that would cause Delek Holdings to violate these and any other covenants in its credit arrangements or otherwise be in default under any of its credit arrangements. As a result we cannot assure you that such covenants will not impact our ability to use the full capacity under our revolving credit facility in the future. Please read Item 1A. \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness, the terms of its borrowings and any future credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business, our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our credit profile. Our current and future credit ratings may also be affected by Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness and financial performance and credit ratings.\u201d\nEquity Units Overview\nOn August 13, 2020, we closed the IDR Restructuring Transaction. To effect this transaction, our Partnership Agreement was amended and updated. See Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement, which subsequently became effective, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed re-sale or disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nOn March 31, 2020, we issued 5.0 million common limited partner units to Delek Holdings as part of the consideration for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition. In connection with the issuance of these units and in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, we issued additional general partner units in an amount necessary to maintain the 2% general partner interest as defined in the Partnership Agreement.\nContemporaneous with the above issuance, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the IDRs associated with the 5.0 million Additional Units for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The IDR Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details.\n 75 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Spending\nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 and planned capital expenditures for the full year 2021 by segment and by major category (in thousands):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Full Year 2021 Forecast </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipelines and Transportation </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance (1)\n</td> <td>2,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discretionary (2)\n</td> <td>6,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipelines and Transportation Segment Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,631 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance (1) (3)\n</td> <td>2,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discretionary (4)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,818 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Spending </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Maintenance capital expenditures represent cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets, and for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures for the repair, refurbishment and replacement of pipelines and terminals, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Delek Holdings has agreed to reimburse us with respect to certain assets it has transferred to us pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n(2) The $5.4 million budgeted for regulatory projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on certain of our pipelines to maintain their operational integrity. The majority of the $6.9 million for discretionary projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on scheduled maintenance and improvements to certain of our tanks and development of our DPG assets. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(3) The majority of the $3.6 million and $2.2 million budgeted for regulatory and maintenance projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment relates to scheduled maintenance and improvements on our terminalling tanks and racks at certain of our terminals. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(4) There is no spending budgeted for discretionary projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment due to the fact that the budget is focused on pursuing projects that are higher priority in the regulatory and maintenance category.\n \nThe amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects. For example, we may experience increases in the cost of and/or timing to obtain necessary equipment required for our continued compliance with government regulations or to complete improvement projects. Additionally, the scope and cost of employee or contractor labor expense related to installation of that equipment could increase from our projections.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nInformation regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below, as of December 31, 2020, is set forth in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td><1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>>5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt and notes payable\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>746,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>996,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest (1)\n</td> <td>35,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,620 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Lease Obligation </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments (2)\n</td> <td>7,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>832,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,164,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes expected interest payments on debt balances outstanding under the DKL Credit Facility and the 2025 Notes at December 31, 2020. Floating interest rate debt is calculated using rates in effect on December 31, 2020.\n(2) Amounts reflect future estimated lease payments under operating leases having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2020.\n \n 76 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWe also have other non-current liabilities pertaining to environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current, there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities in Notes 2 and 17, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is management's analysis of our financial performance and of significant trends that may affect our future performance. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report on Form 10-K\"). Those statements in the MD&A that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.\nUnless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to \"Delek Logistics Partners, LP,\" the \"Partnership,\" we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d or like terms, may refer to Delek Logistics Partners, LP, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole. Unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to \"Delek Holdings\" refer collectively to Delek US Holdings, Inc. and any of its subsidiaries, other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries and its general partner.\nEffective August 13, 2020, the Partnership closed the transaction contemplated by a definitive exchange agreement with the general partner to eliminate all of the incentive distribution rights (\"IDRs\") held by the general partner and convert the 2.0% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for 14.0 million newly issued common limited partner units and $45.0 million in cash (\"IDR Restructuring Transaction\"). Contemporaneously, Delek Holdings purchased a 5.2% ownership interest in our general partner from certain affiliates, who were also members of our general partner's management and board of directors. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective May 1, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Transportation, LLC, acquired Delek Trucking, LLC consisting of certain leased and owned tractors and trailers and related assets (the \"Trucking Assets\") from Delek Holdings, such transaction the \"Trucking Assets Acquisition.\" See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Permian Gathering, LLC, acquired from Delek Holdings a crude oil gathering system located in Howard, Borden and Martin Counties, Texas (the \"Big Spring Gathering Assets\"), and certain related assets, such transaction the \"Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition.\" See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nEffective March 1, 2018, the Partnership acquired from Delek Holdings certain logistics assets primarily located at or adjacent to Delek Holdings' Big Spring, Texas refinery (the \"Big Spring Refinery\"). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the acquisition.\nThe Partnership announces material information to the public about the Partnership, its products and services and other matters through a variety of means, including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, public conference calls, the Partnership's website (www.deleklogistics.com), the investor relations section of the website (ir.deleklogistics.com), the news section of its website (www.deleklogistics.com/news), and/or social media, including its Twitter account (@DelekLogistics). The Partnership encourages investors and others to review the information it makes public in these locations, as such information could be deemed to be material information. Please note that this list may be updated from time to time.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (including information incorporated by reference) contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

Forward-looking information is based on information\n 51 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\navailable at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022our substantial dependence on Delek Holdings or its assignees and their support of and respective ability to pay us under our commercial agreements;\n\u2022our future coverage, leverage, financial flexibility and growth, and our ability to improve performance and achieve distribution growth at any level or at all;\n\u2022Delek Holdings' future growth, financial performance, share repurchases, crude oil supply pricing and flexibility and product distribution;\n\u2022industry dynamics, including Permian Basin growth, ownership concentration, efficiencies and takeaway capacity;\n\u2022the age and condition of our assets and operating hazards and other risks incidental to transporting, storing and gathering crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including, but not limited to, costs, penalties, regulatory or legal actions and other effects related to spills, releases and tank failures;\n\u2022changes in insurance markets impacting costs and the level and types of coverage available;\n\u2022the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for refined products and the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on such demand;\n\u2022the wholesale marketing margins we are able to obtain and the number of barrels of product we are able to purchase and sell in our West Texas wholesale business;\n\u2022the suspension, reduction or termination of Delek Holdings' or its assignees' or third-party's obligations under our commercial agreements including the duration, fees or terms thereof;\n\u2022the results of our investments in joint ventures;\n\u2022the ability to secure commercial agreements with Delek Holdings or third parties upon expiration of existing agreements;\n\u2022the possibility of inefficiencies, curtailments, or shutdowns in refinery operations or pipelines, whether due to infection in the workforce or in response to reductions in demand as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure, or other events, including terrorism, sabotage or cyber attacks, at our facilities, Delek Holdings' facilities or third-party facilities on which our business is dependent;\n\u2022changes in the availability and cost of capital of debt and equity financing;\n\u2022our reliance on information technology systems in our day-to-day operations;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions, including uncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of economic recovery in the United States due to the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") and state commissions and those relating to environmental protection, pipeline integrity and safety as well as current and future restrictions on commercial and economic activities in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022competitive conditions in our industry;\n\u2022actions taken by our customers and competitors;\n\u2022the demand for crude oil, refined products and transportation and storage services;\n\u2022our ability to successfully implement our business plan;\n\u2022inability to complete growth projects on time and on budget;\n\u2022our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses;\n\u2022disruptions due to acts of God, including natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control;\n\u2022future decisions by OPEC+ regarding production and pricing and disputes between OPEC+ regarding such;\n\u2022changes or volatility in interest and inflation rates;\n\u2022labor relations;\n\u2022large customer defaults;\n\u2022changes in tax status and regulations;\n\u2022the effects of future litigation; and\n\u2022other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMany of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 Pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, our actual results of operations and execution of our business strategy could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance upon them. In addition, past financial and/or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance, and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends. We can give no assurances\n 52 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nthat any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Partnership primarily owns and operates crude oil, intermediate and refined products logistics and marketing assets. We gather, transport, offload and store crude oil and intermediate products and market, distribute, transport and store refined products primarily in select regions of the southeastern United States and Texas for Delek Holdings and third parties. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent upon the success of Delek Holdings' refining operations, as many of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek Holdings in support of its Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring refineries.\nThe Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview\" for further details.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 (the \"COVID-19 Pandemic\" or the \"Pandemic\") has resulted in significant economic disruption globally, including in the U.S. and specific geographic areas where we operate. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through both voluntary and mandated social distancing, curfews, shutdowns and expanded safety measures, have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. This has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use, leading to a substantial decrease in consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. As a result, there has also been a decline in the demand for refined petroleum products and most notably gasoline and jet fuel. There is continued uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic which caused reduced consumer demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons during the year ended December 31, 2020 in the United States and globally. Therefore, downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn October 2020, governmental authorities in various states across the U.S., particularly those states in our Permian Basin and U.S. Gulf Coast regions, lifted many of the restrictions created by actions taken to slow down the spread of COVID-19. These actions resulted in an increase in the level of individual movement and travel and, in turn, an increase in the demand and market prices for some of our products relative to late March 2020. However, many of the states where such restrictions were lifted subsequently experienced a marked increase in the spread of COVID-19 and many governmental authorities in such areas responded by re-imposing certain restrictions they had previously lifted. In addition, certain countries globally recently re-imposed previously lifted restrictions due to worsening effects of the increased spread of COVID-19. This response, as well as the increased infection rates, impacts regions that we serve and could significantly impact demand in ways that we cannot predict. Additionally, increased infection rates could impact our logistics operations, particularly in high-infection states, if our employees are personally affected by the illness, both through direct infection and quarantine procedures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, both our West Texas wholesale marketing business and many of our pipeline and transportation customers have experienced the impact on demand and pricing of these unprecedented conditions. Our pipelines and transportation revenue streams were largely protected by minimum commitments under existing throughput contracts with customers during the current period, but continued pressure on our customers could present risks to our existing and new business opportunities as well as on collectability on our receivables. We continue to experience operational constraints as well, including COVID-19 infections at certain of our company locations that have resulted in re-imposed or expanded remote policies and quarantine protocols. We continue to be faced with risk from our suppliers and customers who are facing similar challenges.\nWe have identified the following uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, including the impact related to crude storage space shortages:\n\u2022Customers directly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events in terms of demand for refined product may reduce throughputs which could, likewise, impact the throughput demand for our pipelines, and may seek to renegotiate minimums under contractual force majeure provisions. Such reductions could have a significant impact on our revenues, cost of sales, operating income and liquidity, as well to the carrying value of long-lived or indefinite-lived assets;\n\u2022Customers may experience financial difficulties which could interrupt the volumes ordered by those customers and/or could impact the credit worthiness of such customers and the collectability of their outstanding receivables;\n\u2022Equity method investees may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and/or other events, which may increase the risk of impairment of those investments;\n 53 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022The decline in demand and pricing on our wholesale marketing segment and a decline in demand for pipelines and transportation impacting current results and/or forecasts could result in impairments in certain of our long-lived or indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, or have other financial statement impacts that cannot currently be anticipated;\n\u2022While our current liquidity needs are managed by existing credit facilities, sources of future liquidity needs may be impacted by the volatility in the debt market and the availability and pricing of such funds as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events; and\n\u2022The U.S. Federal Government has enacted certain stimulus and relief measures and is continuing to consider additional relief legislation. To the extent that the provisions do not directly impact the Partnership in the current period or are intended to stimulate or provide relief to the greater U.S. economy and/or consumer, the impact and success of such efforts remains unknown.\nOther uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events may exist that have not been identified or that are not specifically listed above, and could impact our future results of operations and financial position, the nature of which and the extent to which are currently unknown. Actions taken by OPEC+ in April and June 2020, including the agreement for management of crude oil supply in the hopes of contributing to market stabilization (the \"Oil Production Cuts\"), as well as the U.S. Federal Government's passage and/or enactment of additional stimulus and relief measures, may impact the extent to which the risk underlying these uncertainties are realized. To the extent these uncertainties have been identified and are believed to have an impact on our current period results of operations or financial position based on the requirements for assessing such financial statement impact under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we have considered them in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events on our business. Such efforts include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\u2022Reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021;\n\u2022Identifying alternative financing solutions to enhance our access to sources of liquidity;\n\u2022Enacting cost reduction measures across the organization, including reducing contract services, reducing overtime and reducing or eliminating non-critical travel which serves the dual purpose of also complying with recommendations made by the state and federal governments because of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022Implementing regular site cleaning and disinfecting procedures;\n\u2022Adopting remote working where possible. Where on-site operations are required, appropriate safety precautions taken; and\n\u2022Working with our employees to implement other site-specific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure.\nThe extent to which our future results are affected by COVID-19 Pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the Pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. The COVID-19 Pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the Pandemic, could also exacerbate the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 Pandemic may also materially adversely affect our results in a manner that is either not currently known or that we do not currently consider to be a significant risk to our business.\nSee also 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of risks associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nOur Reporting Segments and Assets\nOur business consists of two reportable segments:\n(i) Pipelines and Transportation\nThe assets and investments in our pipelines and transportation segment consist of pipelines, tanks, offloading facilities, trucks and ancillary assets, which provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services primarily in support of Delek Holdings' refining operations in Tyler, Texas, El Dorado, Arkansas and Big Spring, Texas. Additionally, the assets in this segment provide crude oil transportation services to certain third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store. Therefore, we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices with respect to this operating segment.\n(ii) Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling\nThe assets in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment consist of refined products terminals and pipelines in Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. We generate revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler and Big Spring refineries, engaging in wholesale activity at our terminals in West Texas and at\n 54 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nterminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and by providing terminalling services at our refined products terminals to independent third parties and Delek Holdings.\n2020 Developments\nRestructuring Transaction\nEffective August 13, 2020, the Partnership closed the transaction contemplated by a definitive exchange agreement with the general partner to eliminate all of the IDRs held by the general partner and convert the 2% economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest, both in exchange for 14.0 million newly issued common limited partner units and $45.0 million in cash (the \"IDR Restructuring Transaction\"). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which subsequently became effective, for the proposed re-sale or other disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nRed River Expansion project\nIn August 2020, Red River, a joint venture equity method investment which owns a crude oil pipeline running from Cushing, Oklahoma to Longview, Texas, completed a planned expansion project to increase the pipeline capacity from 150,000 bpd to 235,000 bpd. The expansion project commenced operations on October 1, 2020.\nInflation Adjustments\nOn July 1, 2020, the tariffs on our FERC regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties that are subject to adjustment using the FERC indexing increased by approximately 2%, which was the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties, the fee adjusted based on the consumer price index increased 1.6% and the fees adjusted based on producer price index decreased approximately 1.2%. See \"Part 1 - Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Company Overview-2020 Developments\" for further details.\nTrucking Assets Acquisition\nEffective May 1, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Transportation, LLC, acquired Delek Trucking, LLC consisting of certain leased and owned tractors and trailers and related assets from Delek Holdings. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBig Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Permian Gathering, LLC, acquired the Big Spring Gathering Assets from Delek Holdings, located in Howard, Borden and Martin Counties, Texas. See Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIDR Waiver\nOn March 31, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights (\"IDRs\") associated with the 5.0 million newly issued common limited partner units (\"Additional Units\") for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nBusiness Strategies\nOur objectives are to maintain stable cash flows and to grow the quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders over time. We are focused on growing our asset base within our geographic area through acquisitions, project development, joint ventures and enhancing our existing systems. While we will continue to evaluate ways to provide Delek Holdings with logistics services, our emphasis will be to increase the logistics services that we offer to third parties. We intend to achieve these objectives through the following business strategies:\n\u2022Generate Stable Cash Flow. We will continue to pursue opportunities to provide logistics, marketing and other services to Delek Holdings and third parties pursuant to long-term, fee-based contracts. In new service contracts, we will endeavor to include minimum volume throughput or other commitments, similar to those included in our current commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\n 55 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\u2022Focus on Growing Our Business. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to grow our business through both strategic acquisitions and expansion and construction projects, both internally funded or in combination with potential external partners and through investments in joint ventures. Additionally, we believe that our strong relationship with Delek Holdings will enhance our opportunities to grow our business.\n\u25e6Pursue Acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that both complement our existing assets and provide attractive returns for our unitholders. As we continue to grow through acquisitions, we believe we will be able to increase our third party business. In addition to those opportunities to acquire assets from Delek Holdings described below, we believe that our current asset base, and our knowledge of the regional markets in which we operate, will enable us to target and complete attractive third-party acquisitions.\n\u25e6Investments in Joint Ventures. We have grown our asset base to include investments in joint ventures, which have contributed to our initiative to grow our midstream business, while increasing our crude oil sourcing flexibility. We intend to continue evaluating growth opportunities through these investments.\n\u2022Engage in Mutually Beneficial Transactions with Delek Holdings. Delek Holdings has granted us a right of first offer on certain logistics assets. We intend to review our right to purchase any such assets as they are offered to us under the terms of the right of first offer, from time to time. Delek Holdings is also required, under certain circumstances, to offer us the opportunity to purchase additional logistics assets that Delek Holdings may acquire or construct in the future. Further, we anticipate additional growth opportunities through subsequent dropdowns of logistics assets acquired or developed by Delek Holdings. For example, Delek Holdings anticipates offering us certain gathering and logistics assets. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such transaction or whether or on what terms dropdowns will be offered to us by Delek Holdings. We continue to evaluate options with respect to dropdown transactions, which may include changes in capital structure.\n\u25e6Pursue Attractive Expansion and Construction Opportunities. We intend to pursue organic growth opportunities that complement our existing businesses or that provide attractive returns within or outside our current geographic footprint. We plan to evaluate potential opportunities to make capital investments that will be used to expand our existing asset base through the expansion and construction of new logistics assets to support growth of any of our customers', including Delek Holdings', businesses and from increased third-party activity. These construction projects may be developed either through joint venture relationships or by us acting independently, depending on size and scale.\n\u2022Optimize Our Existing Assets and Expand Our Customer Base. We seek to enhance the profitability of our existing assets by adding incremental throughput volumes, improving operating efficiencies and increasing system-wide utilization. We also expect to further diversify our customer base by increasing third-party throughput volumes running through certain of our existing systems and expanding our existing asset portfolio to service more third-party customers.\nCommercial Agreements with Delek Holdings\nThe Partnership has a number of long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Delek Holdings under which we provide various services, including crude oil gathering, crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services, and marketing, terminalling and offloading services to Delek Holdings, and Delek Holdings commits to provide us with minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil, intermediate and refined products. Generally, these agreements include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments and have tariffs or fees indexed to inflation-based indices, provided that the tariffs or fees will not be decreased below the initial amount. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.\nOther Transactions\nStarting in 2018, the Partnership manages a long-term capital project on behalf of Delek Holdings pursuant to a construction management and operating agreement (the \"DPG Management Agreement\") for the construction of a 250-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin (the \"Delek Permian Gathering Project\"). As of December 31, 2020, approximately 178 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational, however, additional costs pertaining to a pipeline connection that was not contributed to the Partnership continue to be incurred and are still subject to the terms of the DPG Management Agreement. The Partnership is also considered the operator for the project and is responsible for the oversight of the project design, procurement and construction of project segments and for providing other related services. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the DPG Management Agreement.\n 56 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our segment performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n(i)volumes (including pipeline throughput and terminal volumes);\n(ii)contribution margin per barrel;\n(iii)operating and maintenance expenses;\n(iv)cost of materials and other; and\n(v)EBITDA and distributable cash flow (as such terms are defined below).\nVolumes\nThe amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil and refined products that we handle in our pipeline, transportation, terminalling, storage and marketing operations. These volumes are primarily affected by the supply of and demand for crude oil, intermediate and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Although Delek Holdings has committed to minimum volumes under certain of the commercial agreements, as described above, our results of operations will be impacted by:\n\u2022Delek Holdings' utilization of our assets in excess of its minimum volume commitments;\n\u2022our ability to identify and execute acquisitions and organic expansion projects and capture incremental volume increases from Delek Holdings or third parties;\n\u2022our ability to increase throughput volumes at our refined products terminals and provide additional ancillary services at those terminals;\n\u2022our ability to identify and serve new customers in our marketing and trucking operations; and\n\u2022our ability to make connections to third-party facilities and pipelines.\nContribution Margin per Barrel\nBecause we do not allocate general and administrative expenses by segment, we measure the performance of our segments by the amount of contribution margin as generated in operations. Contribution margin is defined as net revenues less cost of materials and other and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization.\nFor our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, we also measure gross margin per barrel. Gross margin per barrel reflects the gross margin (net revenues less cost of materials and other) of the wholesale marketing operations divided by the number of barrels of refined products sold during the measurement period. Both contribution margin and gross margin per barrel can be affected by fluctuations in the prices and cost of gasoline, distillate fuel, ethanol and Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"). Historically, the profitability of our wholesale marketing operations has been affected by commodity price volatility, (specifically as it relates to changes in the price of refined products between the time we purchase such products from our suppliers and the time we sell the products to our wholesale customers), and the fluctuation in the value of RINs. Commodity price volatility may also impact our wholesale marketing operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price. Our wholesale marketing gross margin may also be impacted by the fixed price ethanol agreements we enter into to fix the price we pay for ethanol.\nOperating and Maintenance Expenses\nWe seek to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses include the costs associated with the operation of owned terminals and pipelines and terminalling expenses at third-party locations, excluding depreciation and amortization. These costs primarily include outside services, allocated employee costs, repairs and maintenance costs and energy and utility costs. Operating expenses related to the wholesale business are excluded from cost of sales because they primarily relate to costs associated with selling the products through our wholesale business. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of said expenses. Additionally, compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety may require us to incur additional expenditures. We will seek to manage our maintenance expenditures on our pipelines and terminals by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenditures and minimize their impact on our cash flow.\n 57 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCost of Materials and Other\nThese costs include:\n(i)all costs of purchased refined products in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment, as well as additives and related transportation of such products;\n(ii)costs associated with the operation of our trucking assets, which primarily include allocated employee costs and other costs related to fuel, truck leases and repairs and maintenance;\n(iii)the cost of pipeline capacity leased from any third parties; and\n(iv)gains and losses related to our commodity hedging activities.\nFinancing\nThe Partnership paid a cash distribution to its unitholders at a distribution rate of $0.910 per unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 ($3.64 per unit on an annualized basis). Our Partnership Agreement requires that the Partnership distribute all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) to its unitholders quarterly. As a result, the Partnership expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily from operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any potential future issuances of equity and debt securities. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of historic cash distributions.\nMarket Trends\nBusiness Environment\nFluctuations in crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products impact our operations and the operations of other master limited partnerships in the midstream energy sector. In particular, crude oil prices and the prices of related refined products have the ability to influence drilling activity in many basins and the amounts of capital spending that crude oil exploration and production companies incur to support future growth. Throughout the majority of 2018, the prices of crude oil and related refined products remained relatively consistent. Nevertheless, during the fourth quarter of 2018 the prices of crude oil and related refined products decreased significantly due to seasonal impacts. During the first half of 2019, the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased but fell slightly in the third quarter of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, reduced demand for crude oil and refined products related to the COVID-19 Pandemic, combined with production increases from OPEC+, led to a significant reduction in crude oil prices. While OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut oil production, the uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic continues to slow down the recovery of demand for gasoline and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, the downward pressure on commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future. Oil prices have been extremely volatile during the year ended December 31, 2020. The January 2020 high closing price of oil (WTI Cushing) was $63.27 per barrel, which declined to close at $20.48 per barrel on March 31, 2020, reached a second quarter 2020 low of $10.01 per barrel on April 21, 2020 and closed at $39.27 per barrel on June 30, 2020. The WTI Cushing oil price recovered slightly to close at $40.22 per barrel on September 30, 2020 and at $48.40 on December 31, 2020. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, some companies in the Permian Basin acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter and continued into the second and third quarter of 2020. The current market conditions have resulted in lower refinery utilization which in turn has impacted the throughput for our assets and operations. This has impacted our operations leading to a decrease in revenues albeit with at least an equivalent decrease in cost and expenses in some instances. Due to the stabilization in oil prices, albeit at lower prices, during the second half of the year, we experienced improved margins in the West Texas area, and better throughput for our assets with improved gross margins, when compared to the first half of 2020. We believe we are strategically positioned, in these tougher market conditions, to continue developing profitable growth projects that are needed to support future distribution growth in the midstream energy sector and for the Partnership.\nWest Texas Marketing Operations\nOverall demand for gathering and terminalling services in a particular area is generally driven by crude oil production in the area, which can be impacted by crude oil prices, refining economics and access to alternate delivery and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, volatility in crude oil, intermediate and refined products prices in the West Texas area and the value attributable to RINs can affect the results of our West Texas operations. For example, as discussed above, drilling activity and the prices of crude oil and related refined products increased in the first half of 2019 and in spite of a slight decrease in prices in the third quarter of 2019, demand for refined products from our West Texas operations to industries that support crude oil exploration and production began to rebound early in the first quarter of 2020. However due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic there was lower demand and sales of refined products during later part of the first quarter and remained down during the second quarter of 2020. However, during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020, demand and sales of the refined products began to rebound from the second quarter lows.\n 58 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSee chart below for the high, low and average price per barrel of WTI crude oil for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \nAlso, the volatility of refined products prices may impact our margin in the West Texas operations when the selling price of refined products does not adjust as quickly as the purchase price. See below for the range of prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n 59 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \nOur West Texas operations can benefit from RINs that are generated by ethanol blending activities. As a result, changes in the price of RINs can affect our results of operations. The RINs we generate are sold primarily to Delek Holdings at market prices. We sold approximately $3.4 million and $1.2 million of RINs to Delek Holdings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See below for the high, low and average prices of RINs for each of the quarterly periods during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n \nAll of these factors are subject to change over time. As part of our overall business strategy, management considers aspects such as location, acquisition and expansion opportunities and factors impacting the utilization of the refineries (and therefore throughput volumes), which may impact our performance in the market.\n 60 \nNon-GAAP Measures\nOur management uses certain \"non-GAAP\" operational measures to evaluate our operating segment performance and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:\n\u2022Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") - calculated as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, including amortization of customer contract intangible assets, which is included as a component of net revenues in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n\u2022Distributable cash flow - calculated as net cash flow from\noperating activities plus or minus changes in assets and liabilities, less maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursements and other adjustments not expected to settle in cash. Delek Logistics believes this is an appropriate reflection of a liquidity measure by which users of its financial statements can assess its ability to generate cash.\nEBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-U.S. GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other partnerships in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, please refer to \"Results of Operations\" below.\n 61 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nResults of Operations\nA discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The financial statements, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, or net income and net cash from operating activities, respectively.\nReconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in thousands)\n\nReconciliation of net cash from operating activities to distributable cash flow (in thousands)\n\n (1) For a definition of EBITDA and distributable cash flow, please see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" above. (2) Maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures represent cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets, and for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures are expenditures for the repair, refurbishment and replacement of pipelines and terminals, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. (3) For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Delek Holdings reimbursed us for certain capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements). \n \n 62 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-lived Intangibles Impairment\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. An indicator exists when events or conditions indicate that it is more likely than not that the future cash flows associated with an asset group will be insufficient to recover the carrying value. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates, including salvage values (when applicable), from our historical experience and our internal business plans, which requires judgment. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the estimated recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset.\nIn late 2018, we began the process of decommissioning certain common carrier pipelines on the El Dorado Gathering System. The decommissioning entailed taking certain pipelines out of service in an effort to improve the safety and integrity of the El Dorado Gathering System. The project was completed in August 2019. The pipelines that were decommissioned remained physically in place, and the decommissioning did not have a material effect on our financial results. We performed an impairment analysis of our rights-of-ways (\"ROWs\") associated with the decommissioning project. As a result of the analysis, we determined that certain of the ROWs were impaired. This impairment, however, did not have a material effect on our 2019 financial results.\nWe have identified the COVID-19 Pandemic as a significant event during the year ended December 31, 2020 that adversely affected the global economy and the oil and gas industry. The COVID-19 Pandemic has resulted in government-imposed temporary business closures and shelter-at-home directives. This has had the secondary effect of impacting prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services. Additionally, the Pandemic has given rise to other identified uncertainties, as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. For these reasons, we have considered the uncertainties and the related risks in our consideration of the recoverability of Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original amortized book value instead of their higher fair value on acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum volume commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek Holdings, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on these factors and our judgments about their impact, we concluded that we did not have an indicator of impairment with respect to our property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles. In response to the identified significant event relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we assessed whether the carrying amount of our Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles were recoverable by comparing the expected future cash flows to our carrying amount. Based on our analyses, we determined that the Property, plant and equipment of $464.8 million and definite-lived intangibles of $123.8 million were not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Potential Impairment\nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, provides that companies may first apply an optional qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a company concludes that, based on the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company is required to perform the quantitative impairment test. Alternatively, if a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more\n 63 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it has completed its goodwill impairment test and does not need to perform the quantitative impairment test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter.\nWhen applying the quantitative approach to assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"), estimated growth rates for revenue, barrels per day sold/throughput, rates including FERC regulated rates, contribution margin, capital expenditures, and long-term growth rate based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also corroborate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, sustained decrease in rates, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. The most significant risks to our valuation and the potential future impairment of goodwill are the WACC and the throughput and rates, which are mostly driven by the minimum throughput on our commercial agreements with Delek.\nBecause of the significant historical cushion by which the fair value of our reporting units exceeded our carrying value and the relative insignificance of our total goodwill balance ($12.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019) to our balance sheet as a whole, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our assessment was performed based on the events that had occurred through our annual assessment date, and included certain analyses on the most significant inputs in our most recent valuation model to evaluate the impact of these events on the fair value of our reporting units. This included sensitivity analysis and stress testing on certain of our inputs, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the barrel per day (\"BPD\") sold/throughput, which is driven by demand for crude oil and refined products. Except for West Texas, our throughput volume is primarily driven by the minimum throughput in our commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. Additionally, our 2020 assessment included consideration of the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, including its effect on the prices of crude oil and refined products as well as supply and demand for crude oil and refined products, where such conditions may impact our cash flows either directly through our West Texas wholesale operations or indirectly because those prices and supply/demand may impact our customers' needs for our logistics assets/services (see further discussion of the Pandemic and related uncertainties as discussed in the 'Business Overview' section of Management's Discussion and Analysis). Factors impacting our evaluation include the favorable factor that many of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were acquired from entities under common control, and therefore were recorded at their original carrying amount instead of a higher fair value at acquisition, as well as the presence of minimum value commitments in our Commercial Agreements with customers. Judgment is required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers as well as contractual risk which may not always be visible (depending on the customer). Because approximately 90% of our throughput Commercial Agreements are with Delek, a related party, we believe we had adequate information to reasonably assess these risks.\nBased on our annual assessment which involved these qualitative analyses, we determined that there was no indicator that fair value was more likely than not to have declined below carrying value of our reporting units as of our annual assessment dates during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Therefore, the quantitative approach was not required. Accordingly, our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, because conditions and events are rapidly changing, we continue to monitor developments with these events and their impact on our valuation. However, there is uncertainty in and around the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events that have not yet occurred or for existing conditions and events that may have future ramifications that cannot yet be anticipated. Continued or sustained adverse change to these factors may result in potential future impairment of some or all of our goodwill balance.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\n 64 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated results of operations and our segment operating performance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands). The discussion of the year-over-year changes immediately following presents the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020.\n\n \nNet Revenues\nNet revenues decreased by $20.6 million, or 3.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in the average sales prices per gallon and volume of diesel gallons sold, partially offset by increases in the sales volume of gasoline in our West Texas marketing operations:\n\u25e6the volume of gasoline sold increased 12.6 million gallons, partially offset by a 8.1 million decrease of diesel gallons sold.\n\u25e6the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold decreased $0.49 per gallon and $0.71 per gallon, respectively.\nSuch decreases were partially offset by the following:\n\u2022increased revenues associated with agreements executed in connection with Big Spring Gathering System and Delek Trucking acquisitions, which were effective March 31, 2020 and May 1, 2020, respectively; and\n\u2022increased revenues at our El Dorado Gathering System and Magnolia Pipeline as result of increased throughput during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \n 65 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCost of Materials and Other\nCost of materials and other decreased by $67.4 million, or 20.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in the average volumes of diesel sold and average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, partially offset by increases in the average volumes of gasoline sold in our West Texas marketing operations:\n\u25e6the average volumes of gasoline sold increased 12.6 million gallons, partially offset by a 8.1 million decrease of diesel gallons sold.\n\u25e6the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold decreased $0.43 per gallon and $0.66 per gallon, respectively.\n \nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased by $17.9 million, or 24.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decrease in employee and outside services costs due to measures implemented to respond to COVID-19 including delaying non-essential projects; and\n\u2022lower operating costs associated with allocated contract services pertaining to certain of our assets.\n \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 8.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022increases in allocated employee headcount in various operational groups as the Partnership continues to experience growth due to the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition; and\n\u2022increases in legal and professional consulting fees due to various transactions undertaken by the Partnership.\n \nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $9.0 million, or 33.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022addition of assets to our asset base as a result of the Trucking Assets Acquisition and the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition.\n \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $4.5 million, or 9.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022lower floating interest rates applicable to the DKL Credit Facility; and\n\u2022partially offset by increased borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility as a result of our Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Trucking Assets Acquisition and the IDR Restructuring Transaction.\n \nResults from Equity Method Investments\nIncome from equity method investments increased by $2.9 million, or 14.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022an increase in income from our investments in Andeavor Logistics, Red River and CP LLC (as defined in Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), which operate the RIO Pipeline, Red River Pipeline and the Caddo Pipeline System, respectively, as a result of increased revenues for both pipeline systems.\n 66 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Segments\nWe review operating results in two reportable segments: (i) pipelines and transportation and (ii) wholesale marketing and terminalling. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of operating performance are made based on this segmentation. Management measures the operating performance of each reportable segment based on the segment contribution margin. Segment reporting is discussed in more detail in Note 15 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Segment contribution margin is defined as follows:\n\nPipelines and Transportation Segment\nOur pipelines and transportation segment assets provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services to Delek Holdings and third parties. These assets include:\n\u2022the pipeline assets used to support Delek Holdings' El Dorado refinery (the \"El Dorado Assets\")\n\u2022the gathering system that supports transportation of crude oil to the El Dorado Refinery (the \"El Dorado Gathering System\")\n\u2022the Paline Pipeline System\n\u2022the East Texas Crude Logistics System\n\u2022the Tyler-Big Sandy Pipeline\n\u2022the El Dorado Tank Assets and El Dorado Rail Offloading Racks\n\u2022the Tyler Tank Assets and Tyler Crude Tank\n\u2022the Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline and Greenville Storage Facility\n\u2022refined product pipeline capacity leased from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company (\"Enterprise\") that runs from El Dorado, Arkansas to our Memphis terminal and the Big Spring Pipeline\n\u2022pipelines and storage assets acquired in the Big Spring Logistics Assets Acquisition\n\u2022assets acquired in the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition\n\u2022assets acquired in the Trucking Assets Acquisition\nIn addition to these operating systems, we own or lease 264 tractors and 353 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for related and third parties.\nThe following table and discussion present the results of operations and certain operating statistics of the pipelines and transportation segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7, Managements' Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020.\n\n 67 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(1) Throughputs for the Big Spring Gathering System and the Plains Connection System are for approximately 275 days we owned the assets following the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition effective March 31, 2020.\n \nOperational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the pipelines and transportation segment increased by $73.2 million, or 41.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022increased revenues associated with agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition, which were effective March 31, 2020 and May 1, 2020, respectively; and\n\u2022increased revenues at our El Dorado Assets and Magnolia Pipeline as result of increased throughput during the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \nCost of Materials and Other\nCost of materials and other for the pipelines and transportation segment increased by $23.1 million, or 101.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the following:\n\u2022increases in transportation costs related to our trucking assets, including driver wages and benefits and fuel expense proportionate to increase in fees, insurance, supplies and maintenance expenses.\n \nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the pipelines and transportation segment decreased by $12.6 million, or 22.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decrease in employee and outside services costs due to measures implemented to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic including delaying non-essential projects.\n \nContribution Margin\nContribution margin for the pipelines and transportation segment increased by $62.6 million, or 62.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022increases in revenues associated with agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition, Magnolia Pipeline, and El Dorado Assets; and\n\u2022decreases in operating expenses.\n 68 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment\nWe use our wholesale marketing and terminalling assets to generate revenue by providing wholesale marketing and terminalling services to Delek Holdings' refining operations and to independent third parties.\nThe table and discussion below present the results of operations and certain operating statistics of the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7, Managements' Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020.\n\n\n (1) Excludes jet fuel and petroleum coke. (2) Consists of terminalling throughputs at our Tyler, Big Spring, Big Sandy and Mount Pleasant, Texas terminals, our El Dorado and North Little Rock, Arkansas terminals and our Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee terminals. \n \nOperational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment decreased by $93.7 million, or 23.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in the volume of diesel sold and in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel, partially offset by increase in the volume of gasoline sold in our West Texas marketing operations.\n\u25e6the volume of gasoline sold increased 12.6 million gallons partially offset by a decrease of 8.1 million gallons in diesel sold; and\n\u25e6the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold decreased by $0.49 per gallon and $0.71 per gallon, respectively.\nThe following charts show summaries of the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel and refined products volume impacting our West Texas operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n 69 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \nCost of Materials and Other\nCost of materials and other for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment decreased by $90.5 million, or 28.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in the volume of diesel sold and in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, partially offset by increase in the volume of gasoline sold in our West Texas marketing operations.\n\u25e6the volume of gasoline sold increased 12.6 million gallons partially offset by a decrease of 8.1 million gallons in diesel sold; and\n\u25e6the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold decreased by $0.43 per gallon and $0.66 per gallon, respectively.\nThe following chart shows a summary of the average prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased in our West Texas operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to the Refined Products Volume - Gallons chart above for a summary of volumes impacting our West Texas operations.\n 70 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses decreased by $5.3 million, or 27.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022lower operating costs associated with allocated contract services pertaining to certain of our assets; and\n\u2022decreases in variable expenses such as utilities, maintenance and materials costs.\n \nContribution Margin\nContribution margin for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment increased by $2.1 million, or 2.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the following:\n\u2022decreases in cost of materials and other due to decreases in average cost per gallon of diesel and gasoline sold as described above.\nSuch decreases were partially offset by:\n\u2022decreases in revenue due to decreases in average price per gallon of diesel and gasoline as described above.\n 71 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:\n\nAt December 31, 2020 our total liquidity amounted to $107.6 million comprised of $103.4 million in unused credit commitments under the DKL Credit Facility and $4.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have the ability to increase the DKL Credit Facility to $1.0 billion subject to receiving increased or new commitments from lenders and meeting certain requirements under the credit facility. Historically, we have generated adequate cash from operations to fund ongoing working capital requirements, pay quarterly cash distributions and operational capital expenditures, and we expect the same to continue in the foreseeable future. Other funding sources, including the issuance of additional debt securities, have been utilized to fund growth capital projects such as dropdowns. In addition, we have historically been able to source funding at rates that reflect market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings. We continue to monitor market conditions, our financial position and our credit ratings and expect future funding sources to be at rates that are sustainable and profitable for the Partnership. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe believe we have sufficient financial resources from the above sources to meet our funding requirements in the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, quarterly cash distributions and capital expenditures. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy working capital requirements, to service our debt obligations, to fund planned capital expenditures, or to pay distributions will depend upon future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the oil industry and other financial and business factors, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic and crude oil prices, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur largest customer is Delek Holdings, a related party, with whom we have various commercial agreements. Delek Holdings has initiated several steps as part of a strategic plan to navigate the current volatile markets and preserve or enhance its liquidity, including re-negotiating and extending financing arrangements, temporary suspension of growth and non-essential projects, reductions in capital and operating expenditures, divesting of non-strategic and underperfoming assets, suspension of its stock repurchases and dividends, and exploring other potential financing opportunities. We believe such actions will allow Delek Holdings to continue to honor its commercial agreements with us. In addition, we eliminated the IDRs which helped lower our cost of capital and preserve our liquidity.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to a significant decline in crude oil prices or uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our debt agreements. Management continues to actively respond to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic to enhance our liquidity position. Such actions include reducing planned capital expenditures for 2021, seeking alternative financing solutions and enacting cost reduction measures. Refer to the Business Overview section of this MD&A for a complete discussion of the uncertainties identified by management and the actions taken to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all our debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. After considering the current and potential effect of a significant decline in oil prices and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, we currently expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nCash Distributions\nOn January 22, 2021, we announced that the board of directors had declared a distribution of $0.910 per common unit (the \"Distribution\"), which equates to approximately $40 million per quarter, or $158.1 million per year, based on the number of common units outstanding as of February 2, 2021. The Distribution was paid on February 9, 2021 to common unitholders of record on February 2, 2021 and represents a 2.8% increase over the fourth quarter 2019 distribution. We have set a range for distribution growth guidance of $0.005 - $0.015 per unit each quarter for 2021. This increase in the distribution is consistent with our intent to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Although our Partnership Agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per common unit.\n 72 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below summarizes the quarterly distributions related to our 2020 quarterly financial results:\n\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\n \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to lower cash paid out to suppliers for inventory (as opposed to cash received from customers) during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of a decrease in volumes sold for the marketing operations. In addition there were decreases in operational expense payments and increase in cash dividends from the Equity Method Investments. These cash flow increases were offset by the decrease in net cash receipts from customers.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $24.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower contributions to equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the acquisition of the Big Spring Gathering Assets and Trucking Assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We disbursed $12.2 million in additional contributions to our equity method investments during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $139.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was partially financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $100.0 million and the Trucking Assets Acquisition was financed with cash from drawdown of the DKL Credit Facility amounting to $48.0 million of which $0.5 million was recorded as investing activity with $47.6 million recorded in financing activities as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance. Transaction costs paid amounting to $1.0 million were capitalized for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and the Trucking Assets Acquisition. There was no asset acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition there were additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $13.3 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to additions to property, plant and equipment amounting to $9.1 million and distributions from equity method investments amounting to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the $47.6 million excess of purchase consideration over the carrying amount of the assets acquired in the Trucking Assets Acquisition treated as a distribution to Delek Holdings and general partner unitholders pursuant to the asset acquisitions under common control guidance and $45.0 million paid to the general partner in the IDR Restructuring Transaction to eliminate the general partners' IDRs, convert the general partners economic interest to non-economic interest and issue 14.0 million common limited units. This was partially offset by the increase in net proceeds under the revolving credit facility (defined below). We received net proceeds of $158.2 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net proceeds of $131.7 million under the revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we\n 73 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\npaid quarterly cash distributions totaling $136.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to quarterly cash distributions totaling $113.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe sources of cash to finance the asset acquisitions from Delek Holdings during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of the $100.0 million drawdown under the DKL Credit Facility to part-finance the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition and $48.0 million drawdown to finance the Trucking Asset Acquisition. The Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition was also financed by the issuance of 5.0 million units to Delek US Energy, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Delek US Holdings, Inc.).\nDebt Overview\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $992.3 million comprised of $746.6 million under the amended and restated senior secured revolving agreement (the \"DKL Credit Facility\") and $245.7 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d), the latter net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. Deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the 2025 Notes amounted to $3.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase of $159.2 million in our long-term debt balance compared to the balance at December 31, 2019 resulted from the borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility in 2020, primarily driven by the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition, the Trucking Assets Acquisition, the IDR restructuring and amortization of the deferred financing costs and original issuance discount under our 2025 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness consisted of:\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $746.6 million under the Delek Logistics Credit Facility (\"revolving credit facility\"), due on September 28, 2023, with average borrowing rate of 2.44%.\n\u2022An aggregate principal amount of $245.7 million, under the Delek Logistics Notes (6.75% senior notes), due in 2025, with an effective interest rate of 7.45%.\nIn September 2018 the DKL Credit Facility was amended to, among other changes, increase the lender commitments from $700 million to $850 million. The obligations under the DKL Credit Facility remain secured by first priority liens on substantially all of the Partnership's and its subsidiaries' tangible and intangible assets. Additionally, Delek Marketing, a subsidiary of Delek Holdings, had provided a limited guaranty of the Partnership's obligations under the DKL Credit Facility. Delek Marketing's guaranty was (i) limited to an amount equal to the principal amount, plus unpaid and accrued interest, of a promissory note made by Delek Holdings in favor of Delek Marketing (the \"Holdings Note\") and (ii) secured by Delek Marketing's pledge of the Holdings Note to the lenders under the DKL Credit Facility. Effective March 30, 2020, Delek Marketing's limited guaranty and pledge of the Holdings Note was terminated pursuant to a guaranty and pledge release approved by the required lenders under the DKL Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the IDR Restructuring Transaction, the Partnership entered into a First Amendment to the DKL Credit Facility (the \"First Amendment\") which, among other things, permitted the exchange of the IDRs and the general partner interest in the Partnership for the noneconomic general partner interest, the newly issued limited partner interests in the Partnership, plus $45.0 million in cash. The First Amendment also modified the total leverage and senior leverage ratios (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) calculations to reduce the total funded debt (as defined in the DKL Credit Facility) component thereof by the total amount of unrestricted consolidated cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of the Partnership and its subsidiaries up to $20.0 million.\nThe DKL Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 28, 2023. Borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at either a U.S. dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. Borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars bear interest at either a Canadian dollar prime rate, plus an applicable margin, or the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate, plus an applicable margin, at the election of the borrowers. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the facility was approximately 2.44%. Additionally, the DKL Credit Facility requires us to pay a leverage ratio dependent quarterly fee on the average unused revolving commitment. As of December 31, 2020, this fee was 0.35% per year.\nOn May 23, 2017, the Partnership and Delek Logistics Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership ( Finance Corp.\u201d and together with the Partnership, the Issuers\u201d), issued the 2025 Notes at a discount. The 2025 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers, and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15, commencing November 15, 2017.\nBeginning on May 15, 2020, the Issuers may, subject to certain conditions and limitations, redeem all or part of the 2025 Notes at a redemption price of 105.063% of the redeemed principal for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2020, 103.375% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2021, 101.688% for the twelve-month period beginning on May 15, 2022 and 100.00% beginning on May 15, 2023 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In the event of a change of control, accompanied or followed by a ratings downgrade within a certain period of time, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the Issuers will be obligated to make an offer for the purchase of the 2025 Notes from holders at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn April 25, 2018, we made an offer to exchange the 2025 Notes and the related guarantees that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for an equal principal amount of exchange notes that are freely tradeable, as required under the terms of the original indenture.\n 74 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe terms of the exchange notes that were issued in May 2018 as a result of the exchange (also referred to as the \"2025 Notes\") are substantially identical to the terms of the original 2025 Notes.\nWe believe we were in compliance with the covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our third-party indebtedness.\nAgreements Governing Certain Indebtedness of Delek Holdings\nAlthough we are not contractually bound by and are not liable for Delek Holdings' debt under its credit arrangements, we are indirectly affected by certain prohibitions and limitations contained therein. Specifically, certain of Delek Holdings' credit arrangements require that Delek Holdings meet certain minimum covenant levels for (i) consolidated shareholders' equity and (ii) a ratio of consolidated shareholders' equity to adjusted total assets. Delek Holdings, due to its majority ownership and control of our general partner, has the ability to prevent us from taking actions that would cause Delek Holdings to violate these and any other covenants in its credit arrangements or otherwise be in default under any of its credit arrangements. As a result we cannot assure you that such covenants will not impact our ability to use the full capacity under our revolving credit facility in the future. Please read Item 1A. \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness, the terms of its borrowings and any future credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business, our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our credit profile. Our current and future credit ratings may also be affected by Delek Holdings' level of indebtedness and financial performance and credit ratings.\u201d\nEquity Units Overview\nOn August 13, 2020, we closed the IDR Restructuring Transaction. To effect this transaction, our Partnership Agreement was amended and updated. See Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement, which subsequently became effective, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed re-sale or disposition from time to time by Delek Holdings of up to 14.0 million common limited partner units. We will not sell any securities under this shelf registration statement and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities by Delek Holdings.\nOn March 31, 2020, we issued 5.0 million common limited partner units to Delek Holdings as part of the consideration for the Big Spring Gathering Assets Acquisition. In connection with the issuance of these units and in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, we issued additional general partner units in an amount necessary to maintain the 2% general partner interest as defined in the Partnership Agreement.\nContemporaneous with the above issuance, the Board of the general partner waived distributions in respect of the IDRs associated with the 5.0 million Additional Units for at least two years, through at least the distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (\"IDR Waiver\"). The IDR Waiver essentially reduced the distribution made to the holders of the IDRs during this period, as the holders would not receive a share of the distribution made on the Additional Units. An additional waiver letter was signed that waived all of the distributions for the first quarter of 2020 on the Additional Units with respect to base distributions and the IDRs. The IDR Restructuring Transaction on August 13, 2020, permanently eliminated all of the IDRs. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details.\n 75 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Spending\nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 and planned capital expenditures for the full year 2021 by segment and by major category (in thousands):\n\n(1) Maintenance capital expenditures represent cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets, and for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures for the repair, refurbishment and replacement of pipelines and terminals, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations. Delek Holdings has agreed to reimburse us with respect to certain assets it has transferred to us pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements).\n(2) The $5.4 million budgeted for regulatory projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on certain of our pipelines to maintain their operational integrity. The majority of the $6.9 million for discretionary projects in the pipelines and transportation segment is expected to be spent on scheduled maintenance and improvements to certain of our tanks and development of our DPG assets. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(3) The majority of the $3.6 million and $2.2 million budgeted for regulatory and maintenance projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment relates to scheduled maintenance and improvements on our terminalling tanks and racks at certain of our terminals. These expenditures have historically been and will continue to be financed through cash generated from operations.\n(4) There is no spending budgeted for discretionary projects in the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment due to the fact that the budget is focused on pursuing projects that are higher priority in the regulatory and maintenance category.\n \nThe amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects. For example, we may experience increases in the cost of and/or timing to obtain necessary equipment required for our continued compliance with government regulations or to complete improvement projects. Additionally, the scope and cost of employee or contractor labor expense related to installation of that equipment could increase from our projections.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nInformation regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below, as of December 31, 2020, is set forth in the following table (in thousands):\n\n(1) Includes expected interest payments on debt balances outstanding under the DKL Credit Facility and the 2025 Notes at December 31, 2020. Floating interest rate debt is calculated using rates in effect on December 31, 2020.\n(2) Amounts reflect future estimated lease payments under operating leases having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2020.\n \n 76 \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWe also have other non-current liabilities pertaining to environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current, there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities in Notes 2 and 17, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOff-Balance Sheet

COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand and pricing for crude oil and refined products in 2020. This affected the Partnership's operations, especially its West Texas marketing business. \n\n- In 2020, the Partnership completed several acquisitions including the Big Spring Gathering Assets and Trucking Assets from Delek Holdings. These expanded its logistics capabilities.\n\n- For full year 2020 vs 2019:\n\n- Total revenues decreased 3.5% due to lower diesel demand and pricing in West Texas marketing operations, partially offset by contributions from acquisitions. \n\n- Net income increased 64.5% mainly due to lower cost of materials and operating expenses.\n\n- Cash from operations increased due to lower inventory purchases and higher equity investment dividends. \n\n- The Partnership expects to fund operations and distributions through operating cash flow, borrowings, equity/debt issuances. It has adequate liquidity currently.\n\n- Capital spending for full year 2021 is budgeted at $20.8 million, focused on maintenance and regulatory projects. This is lower than 2020 spending.\n\n- Long-term debt increased in 2020 due to borrowings to fund acquisitions. The Partnership was in compliance with debt covenants at year end.\n\nIn summary, the Partnership's results were impacted by lower demand and pricing but acquisitions and cost controls helped offset this. Its financial position appears adequate to fund near-term operations and distributions."}
