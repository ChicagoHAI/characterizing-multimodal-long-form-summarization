Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited financial statements and the notes thereto of CAC, Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC (all as defined below), and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 of this Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation and Discussion\nCaesars Acquisition Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 25, 2013 and was formed to own 100% of the voting membership units in CGP LLC, a joint venture between CAC and subsidiaries of CEC. On October 21, 2013, the joint venture was formed through the execution of the series of Transactions described in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the CAC financial statements. Following consummation of the Transactions, CAC serves as CGP LLC's managing member and sole holder of all of its outstanding voting units, and subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment hold all of CGP LLC's outstanding non-voting units. However, based upon the structure of CGP LLC and the related economics, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity of which Caesars Entertainment is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, CAC does not consolidate CGP LLC into its financial statements. Instead, CAC accounts for its investment in CGP LLC using a balance sheet approach to the equity method of accounting, referred to as hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") accounting.\nCAC's primary asset is its membership interest in CGP LLC. The assets and entities that were acquired by or contributed to CGP LLC in connection with the Transactions (referred to in the aggregate as Predecessor Growth Partners) are considered to be the predecessor to CAC. The combined historical financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and, as the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction are considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control, have been derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment. The combined historical financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses and assets contributed to or acquired by CGP LLC in the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction described previously as if those businesses were combined into a single reporting entity for all periods presented.\nIn addition to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners, we have also presented financial statements of CGP LLC for the period subsequent to the Transactions pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, as CGP LLC represents a significant equity method investment of CAC. As the basis of presentation for all items other than income taxes, non-controlling interests and senior notes returned to Caesars Entertainment related to the subscription right restoration is the same between Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC, and because we believe that the full year 2015 and 2014 information compared with the full year 2013 information for CAC's investment in CGP LLC is material to investors in CAC, we have presented information for both CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\nProposed Merger of CAC with CEC\nOn December 21, 2014, the Company and CEC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, and subject to the overall restructuring of CEOC, regulatory approval and other closing conditions, upon consummation of the Proposed Merger, each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of CAC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Proposed Merger will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, that number of shares of CEC common stock, par value $0.01 per share, equal to 0.664, provided that during the Adjustment Period (as described below), the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee, each composed solely of independent directors, will determine if there should be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio and the amount of any such adjustment, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances affecting the intrinsic value of CAC and CEC. The Adjustment Period is the 14 day period beginning on the later of (i) the date that the CEOC restructuring plan is confirmed and (ii) the date that both CAC and CEC confirm that their respective independent financial advisors have received all information as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in order to render a fairness opinion concerning the Exchange Ratio. If at the end of the Adjustment Period, the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee have not agreed to an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, there will not be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio. Within five business days following the end of the Adjustment Period, either CAC or CEC may terminate the Merger Agreement if (a) the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee cannot agree on an Exchange Ratio adjustment and a failure to terminate the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with their respective directors' fiduciary duties or (b) the CAC Special Committee or the CEC Special Committee, as applicable, has not received an opinion of its respective financial advisor that the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted, if applicable) is fair, from a financial point of view to CAC and its public stockholders or CEC, as\napplicable. Under the Merger Agreement, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger has not been completed by the close of business on August 6, 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, CEC has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the implementation of the restructuring of certain of CEC's subsidiaries as contemplated by that certain Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2014, among CEOC, CEC, LeverageSource III (H Holdings), L.P., LeverageSource V, L.P. and each of the holders of first lien bond claims party thereto and (ii) consult with CAC regarding certain additional actions in connection with the bankruptcy filing contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement if CEC determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such additional actions could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to CAC.\nCAESARS ACQUISITION COMPANY\nOperating Results\nIncome from Equity Method Investment\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, CAC recognized $97.4 million, $79.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of income before tax from its equity method investment in CGP LLC, which equals the amount of income that CAC was entitled to under its minimum guaranteed return. The minimum guaranteed return subsequent to May 2014 includes return earned on capital deployed in connection with the May 2014 acquisitions of JCC Holding Company II, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"Harrah's New Orleans\"), 3535 LV Corporation, (\"The LINQ Hotel & Casino\"), indirect subsidiaries of Parball Corporation (collectively known as \"Bally's Las Vegas\"), and Corner Investment Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"The Cromwell\") by indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC. The minimum guaranteed return also reflects a reduction in the amount of deployed capital upon which such return is earned, equal to the fair value of senior notes distributed from CGP LLC to CAC on August 6, 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nIn addition to its income from equity method investment, CAC incurred direct expenses of $31.2 million, $25.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, respectively, primarily related to professional services fees, as well as general liability insurance, licenses and fees. Operating expenses for 2015 increased by $5.8 million, or 22.8%, when compared with 2014 primarily due to professional services fees mainly driven by an increase in legal and advisory fees. Other expenses for 2014 increased by $25.0 million when compared with 2013 primarily due to professional services fees mainly for the preparation for the Acquired Properties Transaction and Harrah's Transaction. CAC receives distributions from CGP LLC in accordance with the CGP Operating Agreement for reimbursement of its expenses incurred.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013 was $34.2 million, $39.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The effective tax rates for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are 51.7%, 72.9% and 34.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to a lesser change in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCAC's primary source of funds is distributions from CGP LLC. To the extent that CAC requires additional funds, CAC may borrow funds or issue additional equity. However, as CAC does not have operations of its own, it is expected that CAC will not have a significant need for additional liquidity.\nCAC's expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including income tax obligations, are paid by CGP LLC on behalf of CAC pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CGP LLC. These transactions are accounted for as distributions from CGP LLC to CAC.\nCAC has not incurred, nor is it expected to incur, material capital expenditures in the normal course of business or to pursue acquisition opportunities other than through CGP LLC. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nPursuant to the certificate of incorporation of CAC and the CGP Operating Agreement, after October 21, 2016, Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to any transferee of all non-voting units of CGP LLC held by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, to acquire all or a portion of the voting units of\nCGP LLC (or, at the election of CAC, shares of CAC's Class A common stock) not otherwise owned by Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries at such time.\nFollowing October 21, 2018 and until April 21, 2022, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will have the right to cause a liquidation of CGP LLC, including the sale or winding up of CGP LLC, or other monetization of all of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds remaining after satisfaction of all liabilities of CGP LLC to the holders of CGP LLC's units according to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement. On April 21, 2022 (unless otherwise agreed by Caesars Entertainment and CAC), if our Board has not previously exercised its liquidation right, the CGP Operating Agreement provides that CGP LLC shall, and our Board shall cause CGP LLC to effect a liquidation. The conditions upon which the call right may be exercised, the distribution waterfall for net cash and other assets upon a liquidation, and other information related to the potential liquidation are further discussed in Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share to the CAC financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCAC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\nCertain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments will be subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based upon the historical experience of both Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from our estimates.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards such that an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We analyze our variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability, and financial agreements.\nBecause the equity holders in CGP LLC receive returns disproportionate to their voting interests and substantially all the activities of CGP LLC are related to Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity. Additionally, while CAC is the sole voting member of CGP LLC, CAC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of CGP LLC, and therefore we do not consolidate CGP LLC into our financial statements.\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which we have the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no consolidated subsidiaries.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nCAC's primary asset is its investment in CGP LLC. We review this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of our investment exceeds its estimated fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than our carrying value, and our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, CGP LLC, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience and the experience of Caesars Entertainment with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nStock-based Compensation\nCAC may grant stock-based compensation awards in CAC Class A common stock to certain officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Caesars Acquisition Company 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (\"the PIP Plan\"). The PIP Plan provides for the plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Caesars Acquisition Company (the \"Committee\"). CAC has granted restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and stock options to directors, certain of its officers and employees of CGP LLC subsidiaries. RSUs and stock options granted to directors and employees are equity-classified awards and are measured at their grant date fair value for accounting purposes. RSUs and stock options granted to individual consultants and advisors are measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CAC Financial Statements.\nCAESARS GROWTH PARTNERS, LLC AND PREDECESSOR GROWTH PARTNERS\nOverview\nCGP LLC used a portion of the cash proceeds from its October 21, 2013 sale of voting units to CAC to purchase from Caesars Entertainment (i) the equity interests of PHWLV, which holds the Planet Hollywood; (ii) its equity interest in Maryland Joint Venture, which is the entity that indirectly holds interests in Horseshoe Baltimore in Maryland, and (iii) a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager, which manages Planet Hollywood, and Caesars Baltimore Management Company LLC, which manages Horseshoe Baltimore. We refer to these transactions as the \"Purchase Transaction\" and the acquired net assets as the \"Purchased Assets.\" The Purchase Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Purchase Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Purchased Assets.\nAlso on October 21, 2013, Caesars Entertainment contributed to CGP LLC, in exchange for non-voting units, (i) Caesars Entertainment's equity interests in CIE, representing approximately 90.2% of the total issued and outstanding shares of CIE prior to giving effect to any options or warrants that were exercisable at that time and (ii) approximately $1.1 billion face value of aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by CEOC. CGP LLC refers to these transactions as the \"Contribution\nTransaction\" and these assets as the \"Contributed Assets.\" The Contribution Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Contribution Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Contributed Assets. CGP LLC's equity interests in CIE of 90.2% was reduced in November 2014 to 83.3% due to the conversion of the $47.7 million convertible promissory note issued by CIE to Rock Gaming LLC (\"Rock\"), in each case not giving effect to any options, warrants, restricted stock units and restricted stock.\nIn connection with the Purchase Transaction and the Contribution Transaction, CGP LLC entered into agreements with Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries to provide certain corporate shared services and back-office support and business advisory services to CAC and CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. We refer to the Purchase Transaction, Contribution Transaction and the entering into such agreements collectively as the \"Transactions.\" In addition, CGP LLC reimbursed Caesars Entertainment and CAC for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, and will use the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of voting units to CAC for general corporate purposes, including making strategic investments.\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a pre-determined threshold amount in 2015. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the aggregate fair market value of the subscription rights issued by Caesars Entertainment in the amount of approximately $21.1 million was restored to Caesars Entertainment through a return of all 10.75% paid-in kind senior notes and certain 5.75% senior notes previously issued by CEOC from CGP LLC to CEC.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC contributed the equity interests of PHWLV and a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager to CGPH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CGP LLC. Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc., which is a majority-owned subsidiary of CEC. On May 5, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Bally's Las Vegas, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under property management agreements entered into between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the CGPH subsidiary which owns each of these respective properties, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties.\nOn May 20, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) Harrah's New Orleans, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the Louisiana property management agreement entered between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the owners of Harrah's New Orleans and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to Harrah's New Orleans.\nCGPH paid $2.0 billion, less outstanding debt assumed, for the May 2014 transactions above.\nThe acquisitions of Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell and the contribution of Planet Hollywood to CGPH are herein referred to as the \"Acquired Properties.\"\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nIn May 2013, CIE acquired the World Series of Poker social and mobile game assets and intellectual property from Electronic Arts, Inc. In August 2013, CIE acquired an online game development business based in the Ukraine and in October 2013, CIE acquired the workforce, assets and intellectual property of an online gaming development group. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these transactions were not material to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners or CGP LLC.\nIn February 2014, CIE acquired substantially all of the assets of Pacific Interactive, creator and owner of the application House of Fun Slots. CIE recorded $30.5 million in contingent consideration as part of the purchase price allocation related to this acquisition. In March 2015, CIE paid $62.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nPresentation\nThe financial information for the periods presented reflect the financial statements of CGP LLC on a combined and consolidated basis, giving regard to all impacts of the October 21, 2013 and May 2014 transactions. The financial information up through October 21, 2013 does not reflect the impacts of those transactions, including the recording of non-controlling interest or the determination of taxes in accordance with the LLC structure of CGP LLC. Instead, this financial information, referred to herein as Predecessor Growth Partners, presents the combination of those assets and entities that were purchased by or\ncontributed to CGP LLC as derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment.\nAs a result of the May 2014 transactions described above, one or more indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC acquired Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Harrah's New Orleans from CEOC. Because these acquisitions were accounted for as transactions among entities under common control, the financial information herein has been recast to include the financial results for these properties as if those businesses were combined into the CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners reporting entities for all periods presented. Therefore, the financial information contained herein provides comparable operating results for all periods presented.\nFor financial reporting purposes, CGP LLC has two operating units: (1) Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. and (2) Casino Properties and Developments. CGP LLC's Interactive Entertainment operating unit consists of CIE, which is comprised of three distinct but complementary businesses: social and mobile games, World Series of Poker and regulated online real money gaming. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments operating unit consists of Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell and CGP LLC's interest in the Maryland Joint Venture.\nPerformance Metrics - Social and Mobile Games\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013, the CIE business generated 94.6%, 93.6% and 95.6%, respectively, of its revenues from its social and mobile games business. CIE measures the performance of its social and mobile games business by using key financial metrics including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and key operating metrics including Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users, Monthly Unique Users, Average Revenue per User, and Monthly Unique Payers. The following operating metrics help CIE to understand and measure the engagement levels of its players, the size of its audience and its reach.\nDaily Active Users. CIE defines Daily Active Users (\"DAU\") as the number of individuals who played one of its games during a particular day on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games on the same day is counted as two DAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks on the same day would be counted as two DAU. Average DAU for a particular period is the average of the DAU for each day during that period. CIE uses DAU as a measure of audience engagement.\nMonthly Active Users. CIE defines Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\") as the number of individuals who played a particular game in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games in the same 30-day period is counted as two MAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks in a 30-day period would be counted as two MAU. Average MAU for a particular period is the average of the MAU at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MAU as a measure of total game audience size.\nMonthly Unique Users. CIE defines Monthly Unique Users (\"MUU\") as the number of unique individuals who played any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who plays more than one of CIE's games in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUU. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing across multiple platforms, an individual who plays any of its games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUU in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the player. Because many of CIE's players play more than one game in a given 30-day period, MUU are always lower than MAU in any given time period. Average MUU for a particular period is the average of the MUU at each month-end during that period. CIE tracks MUU as a measure of total audience reach across its network of games.\nMonthly Unique Payers. CIE defines Monthly Unique Payers (\"MUP\") as the number of unique individuals who purchased virtual currency in any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who makes multiple purchases of virtual currency on more than one of CIE's games on a particular platform in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUP. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals purchasing virtual currency across multiple platforms, an individual who makes a purchase of virtual currency on any of CIE's games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUP in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the paying user. Average MUP for a particular period is the average of the MUP at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MUP as a measure of monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nAverage Revenue per User. CIE defines Average Revenue per User (\"ARPU\") as (i) the total revenue in a given period, (ii) divided by the number of days in that period, (iii) divided by the average DAU during the period. CIE believes that ARPU provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its results in the same manner as the Company's management and Board of Directors. CIE uses ARPU as a measure of overall monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nThe table below shows the results of CIE's social and mobile games business, using the operating metrics described above, for the periods indicated. User statistics are presented in thousands of users and ARPU is presented in dollars.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Daily Active Users (2)\n</td> <td>6,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Active Users (2)\n</td> <td>19,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Users (2)\n</td> <td>18,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Payers (2)\n</td> <td>819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Revenue Per User\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Metrics for 2013 present the aggregate of Predecessor Growth Partners for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, and for CGP LLC for the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 in order for the 2013 metrics to be comparable to 2015 and 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>CIE systems cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing games in multiple sessions in the same day or in a 30-day period ending with the measurement date, playing the same game across multiple platforms, or playing different titles offered by CIE. Thus, users who play multiple titles on multiple platforms may be counted as more than one user within the respective operating metrics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Consistent with the social and mobile games business model, only a small portion of CIE's social and mobile games players pay for virtual goods. During 2015, CIE had approximately 819 thousand average MUP, or 4.5% of the total number of average MUU on the social and mobile platforms during this period, who purchased virtual goods. The opportunity for social interactions and player generated promotion increases as the overall number of players increase. As such, CIE believes that maintaining and growing its total number of players, irrespective of whether they purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of its business. The sale of virtual goods, however, constitutes the primary source of revenue for CIE's social and mobile games business. The degree to which game players choose to pay for virtual goods in the games is driven by CIE's ability to create content that enhances the game-play experience. CIE's revenue and overall financial performance are affected by the number of players and the effectiveness of its monetization of players through the sale of virtual goods.\nCIE's user metrics are impacted by several factors that cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Growth in the performance metrics is largely attributable to strong organic growth from CIE's games on both mobile and social platforms. Future growth in audience and engagement will depend on CIE's ability to retain current players, attract new players and expand into new markets and distribution platforms.\nThe tables below show the results of CIE's business based upon the financial metrics for the periods presented.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CGP LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor Growth Partners\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 22 Through\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1 Through\nOctober 21, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Social and mobile games\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WSOP and online real money gaming\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows the revenue generated from CIE's social and mobile games business by geographic region for the periods listed and assumes that deferred revenues are spread proportionately across all geographies.

The increase in revenues for CIE was primarily driven by strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games, as well as the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive. The increase in revenues for Casino Properties and Developments was primarily a result of the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino which was substantially completed and available to guests in early May 2015, and was partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans as a result of the April 2015 smoking ban.\nIncome from operations for 2015 was $483.0 million as compared to a loss of $108.0 million in 2014, which was an improvement of $591.0 million. The improvement in income from operations was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units in 2015, the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of the Horseshoe Baltimore. Excluding the impact of the change in fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units and the change in fair value of contingent consideration from both periods as well as the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas, income from operations for 2015 improved by $254.9 million primarily due to the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million for 2014, related to one of CIE's development studios in Minsk, Belarus which was disposed of in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2015 and 2014 was $632.3 million and $416.2 million, respectively. The increase of $216.1 million, or 51.9%, from prior year was driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet revenues for 2014 increased by $512.2 million, or 37.8%, compared with 2013, driven by strong performance in both operating units, including CIE's February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive and the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014.\nLoss from operations for 2014 was $108.0 million as compared with $23.3 million for 2013. The increase in loss from operations was primarily attributable to an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units to be issued to Caesars Entertainment pursuant to the terms of the Transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $77.1 million, or 22.7%, in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues.\nOperating Results\nInteractive Entertainment\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CGP LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor Growth Partners\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 22 Through\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1 Through\nOctober 21, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income/(loss) from operations\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income/(loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>282.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>See Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Interactive Entertainment net revenues increased by $179.7 million, or 30.6%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting primarily from strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games, as well as the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive. Income from operations increased by $168.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues, expense related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration recognized in the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by increased advertising expenses. Net loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million in 2014 due to CIE's suspension of operations of the Minsk development studio.

Lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program who stay at our property and non-lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program not staying at the property. Customer spend means the cumulative rated theoretical spend (which is the amount of money expected to be retained by the casino based upon the mathematics underlying the particular game as a fraction of the amount of money wagered by the customer) across all game types for a specific customer. The average combined gross hold is the percentage of the amount wagered across all game types (including table games and slot machines) that the casino retained.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2015 increased by $298.2 million, or 23.3%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, and by increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans due to the April 2015 smoking ban. Total trips increased approximately 25.8% in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily driven by the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nCasino revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $1,009.6 million and $799.9 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore and completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Gross casino hold also saw a positive variance, increasing from 11.2% in 2014 to 11.9% in 2015.\nRoom revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $323.2 million and $258.4 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenues was primarily due to the availability of rooms and increased rates as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, higher demand in the Las Vegas market and the increase in resort fees in late 2014. Cash average daily room rates for 2015 increased to approximately $123, or 13.9%, when compared to approximately $108 for the same period in 2014. Average daily occupancy was 92.4% and 89.7% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue per available room (\"RevPar\") for 2015 and 2014 was $112 and $98, respectively, or an increase of 14.3%.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $275.0 million and $245.5 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino in 2015 and new offerings that opened in 2014 across the portfolio including various new venues at The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nOther revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $162.9 million and $156.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore as well as increases in entertainment and retail revenue at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nIncome from operations was $193.2 million for 2015 as compared to loss from operations of $74.5 million in 2014. The improvement was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the income impact of increased revenues, offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 increased by $112.1 million, or 44.1%, when compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by increased revenues, partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by favorable casino hold of $12.6 million year over year.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2014 increased by $242.0 million, or 23.3%, when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the opening of The Cromwell in May 2014 and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014. For 2014, total rated trips increased by approximately 31.8% from 2013, driven by a 37.8% increase for non-lodgers, partially offset by a 4.7% decrease for lodgers. While spend per trip for lodgers and non-lodgers increased respectively, the shift to non-lodgers who typically spend less caused combined spend per trip to decline approximately 4.9%.\nCasino revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $799.9 million and $663.5 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell in 2014. Gross casino hold decreased from 11.5% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014.\nRoom revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $258.4 million and $241.0 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenue was primarily due to the introduction of resort fees and renovated rooms at Bally's Las Vegas and The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Cash average daily room rates for 2014 increased to $108, or approximately 25.6%, when compared to approximately $86 in 2013. Average daily occupancy was 89.7% in 2014 and 89.5% in 2013. RevPar for 2014 and 2013 was $98 and $82, respectively, or an increase of 19.5%. The revenue impact of favorable trends in room metrics was mostly offset by a lower number of rooms available due to room renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $245.5 million and $200.6 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by new offerings that opened in 2014 such as various new venues at Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nOther revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $156.6 million and $94.0 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the opening of Drai's at The Cromwell and enhanced entertainment options at the new Axis Theater at Planet Hollywood.\nLoss from operations was $74.5 million for 2014 as compared to income from operations of $139.1 million in 2013. Income impact of increased revenues was more than offset by the combination of an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, increased expenses at The LINQ Hotel & Casino primarily due to its strip-front lease, and increased pre-opening expenses associated with Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $10.7 million, or 4.4%, for 2014 when compared with 2013 primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues.\nIncentives are often provided for customers to stay and play at our properties.

The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. During the third quarter of 2014, CGP LLC sold a portion of the notes to CEOC and distributed the remaining notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC.\nImpairment of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to release losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nGain on Sale of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the Note Purchase Agreement and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Planet Hollywood secured loan contained excess cash flow provisions which required mandatory prepayments when certain conditions were met. Prepayments in excess of the recorded book value of principal owed were recorded in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations of CGP LLC and Combined Statements of Operations for Predecessor Growth Partners. Inclusive of the impact of the loan payoff in conjunction with the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement as defined in Intercreditor Agreement and Collateral Agreements section of Note 7- Debt to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $23.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. There was no Loss on extinguishment of debt recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Other income, net was $3.9 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in Other income, net for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to CIE's gain recognized on a contract termination.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCGP LLC\nThe provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its subsidiary, CIE, which is taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes. CGP LLC's provision for income taxes also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. The provision for income taxes for CGP LLC differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level.\nThe effective tax rates for December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 21.3% and (32.9)%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level in 2015 versus CGP LLC losses not tax benefitted at the CGP LLC entity level in 2014.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nThe provision for income taxes represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. The provision for income taxes for the periods presented differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations partially offset by nondeductible stock-based compensation and nondeductible expenses, including lobbying expenditures and professional fees. The effective tax rate for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013 was 35.8%.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax\nIn June 2014, CIE concluded that, effective August 2014, it would suspend operations of its Minsk development studio. As a result, CIE recorded an impairment of $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2014, CIE settled its accrued contingent consideration liability for $4.5 million and recognized a gain of $1.4 million on the final disposition of the entity. CGP LLC has presented the operations of the Minsk development studio as discontinued operations in CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Loss/(Income) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nCGP LLC\nCGP LLC's non- controlling interest reflects the non-controlling interest associated with consolidating CIE and the Maryland Joint Venture into CGP LLC. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Caesars Interactive for 2015 was $20.2 million. For 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, net loss of $4.5 million and $0.9 million\nwas attributable to non-controlling interests in CIE for the respective period. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the Maryland Joint Venture was $13.1 million, $28.5 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, respectively.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nAs the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners were prepared on a combined basis rather than a consolidated basis, the non-controlling interest associated with CIE is not included within the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners. For the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, net loss attributed to non-controlling interests related to losses in the Maryland Joint Venture and CIE was $5.1 million and zero, respectively.\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its financial performance. EBITDA is comprised of net income before (i) interest expense, net of capitalized interest, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, further adjusted for certain items that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners do not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance.\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure below. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information that allows for an understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of capital investment decisions made for the long-term benefit of CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td>

Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available from cash flows generated by operating activities while cash used for development projects is typically funded from specific project financing and additional debt offerings. CGP LLC may also pursue acquisition opportunities for additional businesses or social or mobile games that meet its strategic and return on investment criteria.\nCGP LLC's capital spending and maintenance, if they go forward, could require significant capital commitments and, if completed, may result in significant additional revenues. The commitment of capital, the timing of completion, and the commencement of operations of development projects are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of requisite approvals from the applicable political and regulatory bodies. Excluding amounts spent for the purchases of businesses, CGP LLC's cash used for capital spending for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 was $174.5 million, $568.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively. Predecessor Growth Partners' cash used for capital spending for the period from January 1, 2013 through October 21, 2013 totaled $156.6 million.\nThe majority of the 2015 capital spending related to the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. The LINQ Hotel & Casino began opening a portion of the Phase II renovations in March 2015 and it was substantially completed in early May 2015. The majority of the 2014 and 2013 capital spending related to The Cromwell which was completed and reopened in the second quarter of 2014, Horseshoe Baltimore which opened in August 2014, and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The LINQ Hotel & Casino were $112.0 million, $111.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The Cromwell were $139.0 million and $58.6 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, capital expenditures net of related payables for Horseshoe Baltimore was $258.6 million.\nLiquidity\nCGP LLC and its subsidiaries' primary sources of liquidity include currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from its operations and borrowings under the $150.0 million CGPH revolving credit agreement (\"CGPH Revolving Credit Facility\") which is intended to satisfy CGPH's short-term liquidity needs. CGP LLC's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $901.7 million and $944.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of total cash and cash equivalents, Caesars Interactive had $99.1 million and $92.1 million in foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Caesars Interactive may use the cash in its subsidiaries outside the U.S. to repay debt payable to related parties, fund operations at these subsidiaries, pursue international acquisitions, or repatriate the cash to the United States.\nPayments of short-term debt obligations and other commitments are expected to be made from operating cash flows. Long-term obligations are expected to be paid through operating cash flows, refinancing of existing debt or the issuance of new debt, or, if necessary, additional investments from its equity holders. CGP LLC's operating cash inflows are used for operating expenses, debt service costs, repurchase of equity from CIE's management shareholders, working capital needs and capital expenditures in the normal course of business. CGP LLC's ability to refinance debt will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, CGP LLC's financial performance, and the limitations applicable to such transactions under CGP LLC's and its subsidiaries' financing documents. Additionally, CGP LLC's ability to fund operations, pay debt obligations, and fund planned capital expenditures depends, in part, upon economic and other factors that are beyond CGP LLC's control, and disruptions in capital markets and restrictive covenants related to CGP LLC's existing debt could impact CGP LLC's ability to fund liquidity needs, pay indebtedness and secure additional funds through financing activities.\nCGP LLC's restricted cash totaled $12.5 million and $40.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include amounts restricted under the terms of the Baltimore Credit Facility and the Cromwell Credit Facility, as defined below. The classification of restricted cash between current and long-term is dependent upon the intended use of each particular reserve.\nIssuers issued $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 9.375% second-priority senior secured notes due 2022 pursuant to an indenture dated as of April 17, 2014, among the Issuers and US Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Indenture\"). On May 8, 2014, CGPH closed on $1.175 billion of term loans pursuant to a credit agreement. CGPH filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (the \"Registration Statement\") on March 30, 2015 and amendments to such Registration Statement on May 18, 2015 and May 29, 2015 to initiate an offer to exchange the 2022 Notes and certain related guarantees in a private offering for a like aggregate amount of CGPH's registered 9.375% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and certain related guarantees (collectively refer to as the \"Exchange Notes\"). The Registration Statement was declared effective on June 26, 2015 (the \"Effective Date\"). The exchange offer was consummated on July 28, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, CGPH had $1,125.7 million, $660.3 million and $45.0 million in book value of indebtedness outstanding for the CGPH Term Loan, 2022 Notes and Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the book value of indebtedness outstanding for the CGPH Term Loan and 2022 Notes was $1,132.5 million and $658.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the assets of Harrah's New Orleans, Bally's Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood and The LINQ Hotel & Casino were pledged as collateral for certain of CGPH's outstanding debt securities.\nIn November 2012, Corner Investment Propco, LLC (\"PropCo\") entered into a $185.0 million, seven-year senior secured credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus 9.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.25% (the \"Cromwell Credit Facility\") to fund the renovation of The Cromwell into a boutique lifestyle hotel. As of December 31, 2015, the assets of The Cromwell were pledged as collateral for the Cromwell Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, CIE had $39.8 million of book value of indebtedness outstanding and payable to Caesars Entertainment which was repaid in its entirety during the year ended December 31, 2015. Horseshoe Baltimore had $318.8 million and $319.2 million for the respective periods, and The Cromwell had $169.2 million and $178.0 million, respectively, of book value of indebtedness outstanding and payable to third-party lenders for the same periods.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CGP LLC had $2,402.3 million and $2,386.2 million, respectively, face value of indebtedness outstanding, including capital lease indebtedness. Cash paid for interest for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $190.9 million, $117.4 million, and $45.3 million, respectively.\nCGP LLC believes that its cash and cash equivalents balance and its cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal operating and debt service requirements during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and to fund capital expenditures expected to be incurred in the normal course of business.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table presents CGP LLC's outstanding third-party debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Final\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rates at\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Face Value at\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Value at December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Growth Properties Holdings Revolving Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>variable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Growth Properties Holdings Term Loan\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,157.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,125.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,132.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Caesars Growth Properties Holdings Notes\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.375%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>675.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Horseshoe Baltimore Credit and FF&E Facilities\n</td> <td>2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.25% - 8.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>327.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cromwell Credit Facility\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>2016 - 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing obligations\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special Improvement District Bonds\n</td> <td>2037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other financing obligations\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,402.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,337.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,311.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current portion of total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,332.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,267.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,291.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________\n(1) Variable interest rate calculated as LIBOR plus 5.25%\nCGP LLC has early adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and reclassified $14.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs from Deferred charges and other assets to a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability in Long-term debt in CGP LLC's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014. See Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants related to debt instruments.\nDuring the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, Propco failed to meet the covenant of achieving consolidated EBITDA of at least $7.5 million. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows CGP LLC to cure this covenant by making a cash cure payment. Such payments were made on March 31, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and on May 22, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows this right to cure provided that (i) in each eight-fiscal-quarter period there shall be no more than five fiscal quarters in which the cure right is exercised and (ii) the cure right may not be exercised in any fiscal quarter that immediately follows two consecutive fiscal quarters in which it was exercised.\nThe CGPH Term Loan also provides for a $150.0 million revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). As of December 31, 2015, $45.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million was committed to outstanding letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has a contractual maturity of greater than one year and CGPH has the ability to repay the outstanding principal balances beyond the next 12 months. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility are intended to satisfy short-term liquidity needs and are classified in Current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On January 21, 2016, CGPH drew an additional $15.0 million of borrowings on its $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Horseshoe Baltimore Credit Facility also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit agreement with a five-year maturity that remained undrawn at December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 7 - Debt of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for further details.\nCIE Credit Facility\nCaesars Interactive entered into a credit facility whereby Caesars Entertainment provided to Caesars Interactive unsecured intercompany loans as requested by CIE and approved by Caesars Entertainment on an individual transaction basis. No principal payments were required on the unsecured intercompany loans until their maturity date of November 29, 2016. The unsecured intercompany loans bore interest on the unpaid principal amounts at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5%. This credit facility did not have any restrictive or affirmative covenants. The outstanding balance on the credit facility was\n$39.8 million as of December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repaid in full the $39.8 million outstanding balance.\nRock Promissory Notes\nIn March 2012, Rock and CIE entered into an agreement pursuant to which Rock purchased approximately 6,155 shares of CIE common stock for $30.4 million in cash and agreed to purchase additional shares of CIE common stock on or before July 2, 2012. CIE used the proceeds from this sale to prepay a portion of the then outstanding balance on the credit facility. In June 2012, CIE and Rock modified the agreement with Rock such that CIE issued to Rock approximately 382 shares of CIE common stock and a promissory note for $28.5 million in exchange for $30.4 million in cash. The promissory note was convertible into approximately 5,773 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. In November 2012, CIE issued to Rock an additional promissory note for $19.2 million in exchange for $19.2 million in cash. The additional promissory note was convertible into approximately 3,140 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. Both promissory notes automatically converted into 8,913 shares of CIE common stock in November 2014.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. Upon the October 21, 2013 closing of the Transactions, CGP LLC recorded a liability of $167.8 million representing the estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units. The estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units was adjusted to $228.0 million and $345.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The change in fair value was a decrease of $117.2 million for 2015 and an increase of $38.7 million for 2014, respectively, which was reported within the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nAt December 31, 2013, CGP LLC owned $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of the CEOC Notes.\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of notes previously issued by CEOC as a dividend to its members, pro rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. CAC, as a member of CGP LLC and the holder of 42.4% of the economic interests in CGP LLC at the time of the Notes Distribution, received in connection with the Notes Distribution $137.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes and $151.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes.\nOther Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes CGP LLC's contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2015.

Certain accounting policies, including the estimated consumption rate of virtual goods that is used for revenue recognition in the social and mobile games business, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, the valuation of contingent consideration, the valuation of contingently issuable non-voting membership units, and the evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, require that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' significant accounting policies, please refer to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the CGP LLC consolidated financial statements and Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Predecessor Growth Partners combined financial statements.\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners select the principle or method that they consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires them to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners have made their best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nCGP LLC consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC analyzes its variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. CGP LLC's analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on CGP LLC's review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. Based on current analysis, Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC, has an ownership interest in CR Baltimore Holdings (\"CRBH\"), a variable interest entity. Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of CRBH and therefore consolidates CRBH into its financial statements. As Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC is wholly-owned by CGP LLC, CGP LLC therefore also consolidates the CRBH variable interest.\nCGP LLC also consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which CGP LLC has the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method.\nCGP LLC's consolidated financial statements include the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\nUp through and including October 21, 2013, Predecessor Growth Partners combined into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Predecessor Growth Partners analyzed its variable interests to determine if the entity that was party to the variable interest was a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. Based on the analyses, Predecessor Growth Partners was the primary beneficiary, and therefore had included the Horseshoe Baltimore development project in Maryland, a variable interest entity, in its combined financial statements.\nPredecessor Growth Partners' combined financial statements include the accounts of Predecessor Growth Partners and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. These combined financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that Predecessor Growth Partners had the ability to control.\nApplication of Acquisition Method Accounting\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to the former owners of Buffalo Studios to settle the contingent obligation.\nOn February 13, 2014, CIE acquired 100% of the voting and economic interest in Pacific Interactive, a company based in the United Kingdom. Aggregate consideration was $51.8 million, including CIE's preliminary estimate of $30.5 million in contingent consideration. Pacific Interactive is the operator of House of Fun Slots, which is among the leading social and mobile casino-themed games on Facebook, iOS, and Android platforms. Similar to CIE's legacy games, Pacific Interactive offers its games under a \"free-to-play\" model in which users can download and play the game for free, but are charged for additional game coins and other virtual consumable goods.\nCIE applied the acquisition method of accounting to these business combinations, which required the company to identify the acquiring entity, determine the appropriate acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, and recognize and measure goodwill.\nThe application of the acquisition method accounting guidance had the following effects on its consolidated financial statements: (i) CIE measured the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions and recognized such in CGP LLC's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014; (ii) CIE reported the operating results of Buffalo Studios in Predecessor Growth Partners' combined statements of operations and cash flows for the period ended October 21, 2013 as well as in CGP LLC's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to October 21, 2013; and (iii) CIE reported the operating results of Pacific Interactive subsequent to its acquisition date.\nCIE engaged independent third-party valuation expertise to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as the established user base, the game engine and the developed games, and in the fair value determination of any other significant tangible assets or liabilities, such as long-lived property. Enterprise value allocation methodology requires that management make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. If actual amounts significantly differ from the estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, the resulting difference can materially affect the fair value of net assets.\nCIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Buffalo Studios' assets of approximately $52.9 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $2.1 million, excluding contingent consideration. CIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Pacific Interactive's assets of approximately $64.2 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $12.4 million, excluding contingent consideration.\nInvestment in CES\nInvestment in CES consists of membership interests in CES which is a variable interest entity of which CGP LLC owns less than 20% and is not the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC does not exercise significant influence over the variable interest entity and therefore accounts for the investment using the cost method (see Note 19 - Related Party Transactions to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1). CGP LLC reviews this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, CGP LLC considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of CGP LLC's investment exceeds its estimated fair value, CGP LLC evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than CGP LLC's carrying value, and CGP LLC's intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. CGP LLC also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established. CGP LLC did not recognize an impairment charge in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 on this investment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCGP LLC has significant capital invested in its long-lived assets and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in the financial results and whether CGP LLC has a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. CGP LLC assigns lives to its assets based on its standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. CGP LLC reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management\nin performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the asset group level, which, for most of CGP LLC's assets, is the individual property.\nGoodwill and Other Non-Amortizing Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners determined the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. CGP LLC also evaluates, and Predecessor Growth Partners also evaluated, the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in CGP LLC's industry.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed an annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of September 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of October 1 or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of non-amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the \"Relief from Royalty Method\" and \"Excess Earnings Method\" under the income approach.\nThe annual evaluation of goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results, valuation multiples, and discount rates to determine their fair value. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect these estimates. Thus, to the extent the gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or CGP LLC does not meet its projected performance, CGP LLC could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets have been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC had approximately $302.5 million in total book value of goodwill and $260.7 million of other non-amortizing intangible assets that are at risk of further partial or total impairment should CGP LLC experience minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions in the future. Of this amount, $237.0 million is allocated to Planet Hollywood, Harrah's New Orleans and CIE reporting units. These reporting units have estimated fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values and therefore, are not at risk of partial or total impairment outside of drastic, unforeseen circumstances. Specifically, Planet Hollywood's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 189.1%, Harrah's New Orleans' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 34.7%, and CIE's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 951.0%. $65.5 million of goodwill is allocated to our Bally's Las Vegas reporting unit, at which we recorded impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, Bally's Las Vegas' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 13.8%. Thus, to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis. Impairment charges related to goodwill or intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized in impairment of goodwill or impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nInteractive Entertainment-Social and Mobile Games\nCIE derives revenue from the sale of virtual goods within casino-themed social and mobile games which are played on various global social and mobile third-party platforms. CIE's largest application, Slotomania, represented 48.5%, 51.0% and 63.6% of CIE's social and mobile games revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCIE's social and mobile games operate on a free-to-play model, whereby game players may collect virtual currency or other virtual consumable goods (collectively referred to as \"virtual goods\" or \"virtual currency\") free of charge through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players have the ability to send free \"gifts\" of virtual goods to their friends through interactions with certain social platforms. If a game player wishes to obtain virtual goods above\nand beyond the level of free virtual goods available to that player, the player may purchase additional virtual goods. Once a purchase is completed, the virtual goods are deposited into the player's account and are not separately identifiable from previously purchased virtual goods or virtual goods obtained by the game player for free.\nOnce obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play. When virtual currency is played in the games, the game player could \"win\" and would be awarded additional virtual currency, or could \"lose\" and lose the future use of that virtual currency. As the game player does not receive any additional benefit from the games, nor is the game player entitled to any additional rights once the game player's virtual goods are substantially consumed, CIE has concluded that the virtual goods represent consumable goods.\nCIE has determined through a review of customer play behavior that game players who purchase virtual currency generally are not purchasing additional virtual currency if their existing virtual goods balances have not been substantially consumed. As CIE is able to track the duration between purchases of virtual currency for individual game players, CIE is able to reliably estimate the period of time over which virtual currency is consumed. As such, CIE recognizes revenue using an item-based revenue model.\nBecause CIE is unable to distinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency, CIE must estimate the amount of outstanding purchased virtual currency at each reporting period based on customer behavior. Based upon an analysis of the customers' historical play behavior, the timing difference between when virtual currencies are purchased by a customer and when those virtual currencies are consumed in gameplay is relatively short. CIE records within Other current liabilities the deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games, and also records within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CIE had deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games of $3.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, recorded within Other current liabilities on CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. CIE also recorded within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue, aggregating $1.2 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCIE continues to gather detailed customer play behavior and assesses this data in relation to its revenue recognition policy. To the extent the customer play behavior changes, CIE reassesses its estimates and assumptions used for revenue recognition.\nCIE's games are played on various social and mobile third-party platforms for which such third parties collect monies from CIE's customers and pay CIE an amount after deducting a platform fee. CIE is the primary obligor with its customers, and under most of these arrangements, retains the ability to establish the pricing for its virtual currencies and assumes all credit risk with its customers.\nBased upon the above facts, CIE recognizes the majority of its revenues from its game-playing customers on a gross basis and related platform fees are recorded as a component of operating expense.\nPrior to September 2013, transactions conducted through the Facebook platform were facilitated using Facebook credits (\"FB Credits\"), which is a form of virtual currency specific to the Facebook platform. Effectively, transactions priced by CIE to sell a specified number of virtual goods for a specified cost in a game player's local currency had FB Credits inserted into the transaction flow, whereby the purchase price paid by the game player was first converted to FB Credits, and the FB Credits were then converted into the resulting number of virtual goods. This provided a means for Facebook platform users to accumulate FB Credits prior to making an in-application purchase, and for the Facebook platform to provide to its users FB Credits at a discount or for free.\nSubsequent to the September 2013 elimination of FB Credits, Facebook may provide free gift cards or determine other means of discounting virtual currencies purchased by the Facebook platform users. As a result, CIE reviews the individual transaction details to ensure that revenues recognized for the sale of virtual currencies through the Facebook platform represent cash paid for such currencies by CIE's game players.\nTaxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. This instrument was considered a derivative instrument. Therefore, the balance of this liability was adjusted to reflect the expected number of non-voting units to be issued at the current estimated fair value of those units at each reporting date. Both the estimate of the number of units to be issued and the estimated fair value of non-voting units at the reporting date fall into Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the\nContingently issuable non-voting membership units payable was forecasted earnings. Significant changes in forecasted earnings would have resulted in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nStock-based Compensation\nIn addition to the CAC Equity Plan, Caesars Entertainment grants stock-based compensation awards in Caesars Entertainment common stock to certain employees that work for the management companies of the casino properties under the Caesars 2012 Performance Incentive Plan.\nCIE grants stock-based compensation awards in CIE common stock to its employees and service providers in accordance with the Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. Amended and Restated Management Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is intended to promote the interests of CIE and its shareholders by providing key employees, directors, service providers and consultants with an incentive to encourage their continued employment or service and improve the growth and profitability of CIE. The Plan provides for the Plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee (\"HRC\") of the Committee. As a matter of policy, the exercise price of all options granted under the Plan has been determined by the Committee to ensure that the exercise price of options granted under the Plan complies with the requirement that such exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying shares at the respective grant dates.\nIn February 2014, the Committee approved a liquidity plan, setting forth the terms and conditions upon which CIE may elect to purchase, or cause to be purchased, CIE owned shares and/or shares underlying options, RSUs, restricted stock or warrants (\"deemed held shares\") held by eligible individuals, from time to time, during the term of the plan, and providing the eligible individuals with a market for their CIE shares and/or deemed held shares (the \"Liquidity Plan\").\nThe following is a description of the components of these programs under the Plan as of December 31, 2015:\nStock Options and Warrants\nTime-based stock options and warrants have been granted to employees and non-employees, and are subject to graded vesting periods ranging from three to seven years. Vesting is subject to the participant's continued employment or service, through the applicable vesting date.\nAll warrants to non-employees and the majority of the stock options to employees and non-employees contain a call option, at a fixed amount, which is exercisable by CIE. Since the embedded call feature is at a fixed price, the call feature could result in a repurchase amount that is less than the fair value of the underlying shares. Therefore, these options and warrants are liability-classified instruments and are measured at fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. Prior to 2014, options without the call provision were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. All unexercised options and warrants expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.\nAs described above, the Committee approved the Liquidity Plan to provide offers to repurchase certain awards and CIE shares from participants of the Plan. For accounting purposes, the provisions of the Liquidity Plan were deemed to modify the awards underlying the Plan. Effectively, the Company has determined to account for the subject stock options and warrants as if CIE has a conditional obligation to settle such options in cash at some future date pursuant to the Liquidity Plan. However, (i) the Liquidity Plan is fully at CIE's discretion, (ii) requires additional approval by the HRC for all future purchases and (iii) makes no commitment that any specific employees will be permitted to participate in future shares or deemed share purchases, if any. As a result of this modification, all outstanding options and warrants granted under the Plan were modified to be accounted for as liability-classified awards at December 31, 2015.\nCertain CIE employees have been granted CIE stock options with vesting conditions achieved upon CIE meeting certain consolidated earnings targets. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost recorded over the estimated service period implied by the particular performance target pertaining to each tranche of awards.\nCertain non-employees have been granted CIE stock options which initially contained vesting conditions associated with the legalization and implementation of online gaming in the U.S. Under the original grant agreements, these stock options were to vest based on conditions other than market, performance or service conditions and therefore were recorded as liability-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. These stock options were modified during 2015 to remove such vesting conditions and to instead subject the awards to graded three year vesting from the date of modification. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph, and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost to be recognized ratably by CIE over the amended three-year vesting schedule.\nRestricted Shares and RSU's\nCertain key employees of a subsidiary of CIE have been granted restricted shares which became fully vested during 2014 and which were reclassified to equity in 2015.\nCertain key CIE employees have been granted RSUs, which are subject to vesting periods ranging from two to seven years. For RSU awards subject to a seven-year vesting period, 25% of the award vests ratably over four years, 25% vests ratably over 5 years, 25% vests ratably over six years and 25% vests ratably over seven years. The remaining RSUs are subject to either cliff vesting, whereby 100% of the award vests once the service period has been met, or graded vesting, whereby the award vests ratably over the service period.\nFor the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, restricted shares and RSUs were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. Restricted shares and RSUs were subject to the provisions of the Liquidity Plan as described above and were deemed modified in 2014. As a result of this modification, the Company reversed any previously recorded expense in 2014 and any outstanding restricted shares and RSUs were recorded at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. If an RSU is not repurchased within six months and one day of vesting, the award will be reclassified to equity and CIE will no longer record the award at fair value.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $5,221 to $5,446 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $8,000 to $10,710 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $12,630 to $15,340 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $54.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring January and February 2016, CIE repurchased shares at a price of $15,740 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $26.7 million during January and February 2016.\nValuation of CIE Common Stock\nCIE determines the value of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the \"Practice Aid\") with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, and taking into account facts and circumstances specific to each quarter. Given the relative independence of the components of the entity, the valuation specialists, performed sum of the parts valuations which used a combination of market-based and income-based approaches for the various business components to determine the value of each component of the business, and then aggregated these component values to arrive at the estimated business enterprise value.\nAfter concluding on a business enterprise value, that value is converted into an equity value by subtracting the debt on the balance sheets as of each valuation date. The resultant equity value was divided by the number of outstanding common shares and in-the-money options and warrants at each valuation date to determine the fair value of an individual share of common stock.\nThe valuation specialists also considered the appropriate premiums and discounts that must be assessed in relation to the valuation of CIE's common stock supporting the outstanding options and warrants. The majority of CIE's common stock is owned by CGP LLC. As such, any shares obtained pursuant to options and warrants will have the same inability to control or influence decisions that are subject to shareholder approval as the shares that were obtained in the first quarter 2012 arms-length sale of CIE's common stock to an independent investor and in the fourth quarter sale of CIE's common stock pursuant to the third-party investor's exercise of their purchase option. As such, the common stock valuation methodology used for purposes of valuing stock options did not require any additional discount for lack of control.\nHaving taken the above considerations into account, the fair value of CIE's common stock was then used by an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of CIE's options and warrants.\nShare-based Payments to Non-Employees of CAC or CGP LLC\nOn April 9, 2014, the Board approved the CAC Equity-Based Compensation Plan for CEC Employees for officers and employees of CEC and its subsidiaries as well as certain other individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. CEC will administer the Equity Plan. Under the Equity Plan, CEC is authorized to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, cash awards, rights to purchase or acquire shares or similar securities in the form of or with a value related to our common stock to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. The Equity Plan will terminate ten years\nafter approval by the Board. Subject to adjustments in connection with certain changes in capitalization, the maximum value of the shares of our Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards under the Equity Plan is $25.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2014, CEC granted awards to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries in accordance with the Equity Plan in order to reward and provide incentive for services provided in their capacity, promote the success of CGP LLC and more closely align the interests of such individuals with those of the stockholders of the Company. Awards under this plan vest one-third on each of October 21, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Expense associated with the vesting of such awards is recorded as management fee expense by CGP LLC, totaling $11.9 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, such shares will be contributed to CGP LLC by CAC as additional investment into that entity, at which time CGP LLC will settle its management fee obligation with CEC and its subsidiaries through a distribution of such shares to CEC. Also upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, CGP LLC will issue an equivalent number of voting units in CGP LLC and distribute those units to CAC. As CAC will receive voting units in CGP LLC in exchange for the shares of CAC issued pursuant to this plan, there is no expected dilutive impact to CAC's Earnings per Share (\"EPS\") (see Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share).\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nPredecessor Growth Partners' investments in senior notes of approximately $1.1 billion, issued by CEOC, a related party, were classified as available for sale investments and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. Any discount or premium was amortized to interest income using the effective interest method. CGP LLC classified the investment in notes from related party as current or long-term depending on the maturity of the instruments along with management's intent on holding such instruments.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to recognize losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nCGP LLC records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. CGP LLC reduces the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, CGP LLCs' experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFor periods reported through October 21, 2013, the provision for income taxes for Predecessor Growth Partners represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. For the period from October 22, 2013 through May 2014, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE, which was taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, and also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. For periods subsequent to the May 2014 acquisitions, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 and under Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Predecessor Growth Partners Combined Financial Statements.\nOther Items\nFormation of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC\nCES, a services joint venture among CEOC, CERP, a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, and CGPH, manages CGP LLC's properties and provides CGP LLC with access to Caesars Entertainment's management expertise, intellectual property, back office services and Total Rewards loyalty program. CES also employs personnel under each property's corresponding property management agreement. Operating expenses are allocated to each Member with respect to their respective properties serviced by CES in accordance with historical allocation methodologies, subject to annual revisions and certain prefunding requirements. Corporate expenses that are not allocated to the properties directly are allocated by CES to CEOC, CERP, and CGPH according to their allocation percentages (initially 70.0%, 24.6% and 5.4%, respectively), subject to annual review. As a result of an annual review undertaken in September 2015 but effective July 2015, the allocation percentages were revised to 65.4%, 21.8% and 12.8%, respectively. CGPH has notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objects to the new expense allocation but will pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserves all rights. On October 1, 2014, CES began operations in Nevada, Louisiana and certain other jurisdictions in which regulatory approval had been received or was not required, including through the commencement of direct employment by CES of certain designated enterprise-wide employees.\nOmnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement\nOn May 20, 2014, the Members entered into the Omnibus Agreement, which granted licenses to the Members and certain of their affiliates in connection with the formation of CES. Initial contributions by the Members included a $22.5 million cash payment by CGP LLC on behalf of CGPH in October 2014. Pursuant to a capital call during the three months ended December 31, 2014, CGP LLC contributed an additional $0.1 million on behalf of CGPH. Pursuant to capital calls during the year ended December 31, 2015, CGPH contributed an additional $3.9 million to CES. On October 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, the Members transitioned certain executives and employees to CES and the services of such employees were available as part of CES's provision of services to the Members and certain of their affiliates that own properties that require CES services under the Omnibus Agreement.\nUnder the Omnibus Agreement, CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and certain of their subsidiaries that granted CES a non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free license in and to all intellectual property owned or used by such licensors, including all intellectual property (a) currently used, or contemplated to be used, in connection with the properties owned by the Members and their respective affiliates, including any and all intellectual property related to the Total Rewards program, and (b) necessary for the provision of services contemplated by the Omnibus Agreement and by the applicable management agreement for any such property (collectively, the \"Enterprise Assets\").\nCES granted to the properties owned or controlled by the Members, and their respective affiliates, non-exclusive licenses to the Enterprise Assets. CES granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and the properties owned or controlled by the Members licenses to any intellectual property that CES develops or acquires in the future that is not a derivative of the intellectual property licensed to it. CES also granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI and CGPH a non-exclusive license to intellectual property specific to the properties controlled by CGPH, CERP and their subsidiaries for any uses consistent with the uses made by CEOC, CLC, and CWI with respect to such intellectual property prior to the date of the Omnibus Agreement.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited financial statements and the notes thereto of CAC, Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC (all as defined below), and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 of this Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation and Discussion\nCaesars Acquisition Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 25, 2013 and was formed to own 100% of the voting membership units in CGP LLC, a joint venture between CAC and subsidiaries of CEC. On October 21, 2013, the joint venture was formed through the execution of the series of Transactions described in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the CAC financial statements. Following consummation of the Transactions, CAC serves as CGP LLC's managing member and sole holder of all of its outstanding voting units, and subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment hold all of CGP LLC's outstanding non-voting units. However, based upon the structure of CGP LLC and the related economics, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity of which Caesars Entertainment is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, CAC does not consolidate CGP LLC into its financial statements. Instead, CAC accounts for its investment in CGP LLC using a balance sheet approach to the equity method of accounting, referred to as hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") accounting.\nCAC's primary asset is its membership interest in CGP LLC. The assets and entities that were acquired by or contributed to CGP LLC in connection with the Transactions (referred to in the aggregate as Predecessor Growth Partners) are considered to be the predecessor to CAC. The combined historical financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and, as the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction are considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control, have been derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment. The combined historical financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses and assets contributed to or acquired by CGP LLC in the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction described previously as if those businesses were combined into a single reporting entity for all periods presented.\nIn addition to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners, we have also presented financial statements of CGP LLC for the period subsequent to the Transactions pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, as CGP LLC represents a significant equity method investment of CAC. As the basis of presentation for all items other than income taxes, non-controlling interests and senior notes returned to Caesars Entertainment related to the subscription right restoration is the same between Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC, and because we believe that the full year 2015 and 2014 information compared with the full year 2013 information for CAC's investment in CGP LLC is material to investors in CAC, we have presented information for both CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\nProposed Merger of CAC with CEC\nOn December 21, 2014, the Company and CEC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, and subject to the overall restructuring of CEOC, regulatory approval and other closing conditions, upon consummation of the Proposed Merger, each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of CAC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Proposed Merger will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, that number of shares of CEC common stock, par value $0.01 per share, equal to 0.664, provided that during the Adjustment Period (as described below), the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee, each composed solely of independent directors, will determine if there should be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio and the amount of any such adjustment, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances affecting the intrinsic value of CAC and CEC. The Adjustment Period is the 14 day period beginning on the later of (i) the date that the CEOC restructuring plan is confirmed and (ii) the date that both CAC and CEC confirm that their respective independent financial advisors have received all information as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in order to render a fairness opinion concerning the Exchange Ratio. If at the end of the Adjustment Period, the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee have not agreed to an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, there will not be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio. Within five business days following the end of the Adjustment Period, either CAC or CEC may terminate the Merger Agreement if (a) the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee cannot agree on an Exchange Ratio adjustment and a failure to terminate the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with their respective directors' fiduciary duties or (b) the CAC Special Committee or the CEC Special Committee, as applicable, has not received an opinion of its respective financial advisor that the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted, if applicable) is fair, from a financial point of view to CAC and its public stockholders or CEC, as\napplicable. Under the Merger Agreement, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger has not been completed by the close of business on August 6, 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, CEC has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the implementation of the restructuring of certain of CEC's subsidiaries as contemplated by that certain Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2014, among CEOC, CEC, LeverageSource III (H Holdings), L.P., LeverageSource V, L.P. and each of the holders of first lien bond claims party thereto and (ii) consult with CAC regarding certain additional actions in connection with the bankruptcy filing contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement if CEC determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such additional actions could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to CAC.\nCAESARS ACQUISITION COMPANY\nOperating Results\nIncome from Equity Method Investment\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, CAC recognized $97.4 million, $79.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of income before tax from its equity method investment in CGP LLC, which equals the amount of income that CAC was entitled to under its minimum guaranteed return. The minimum guaranteed return subsequent to May 2014 includes return earned on capital deployed in connection with the May 2014 acquisitions of JCC Holding Company II, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"Harrah's New Orleans\"), 3535 LV Corporation, (\"The LINQ Hotel & Casino\"), indirect subsidiaries of Parball Corporation (collectively known as \"Bally's Las Vegas\"), and Corner Investment Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"The Cromwell\") by indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC. The minimum guaranteed return also reflects a reduction in the amount of deployed capital upon which such return is earned, equal to the fair value of senior notes distributed from CGP LLC to CAC on August 6, 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nIn addition to its income from equity method investment, CAC incurred direct expenses of $31.2 million, $25.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, respectively, primarily related to professional services fees, as well as general liability insurance, licenses and fees. Operating expenses for 2015 increased by $5.8 million, or 22.8%, when compared with 2014 primarily due to professional services fees mainly driven by an increase in legal and advisory fees. Other expenses for 2014 increased by $25.0 million when compared with 2013 primarily due to professional services fees mainly for the preparation for the Acquired Properties Transaction and Harrah's Transaction. CAC receives distributions from CGP LLC in accordance with the CGP Operating Agreement for reimbursement of its expenses incurred.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013 was $34.2 million, $39.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The effective tax rates for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are 51.7%, 72.9% and 34.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to a lesser change in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCAC's primary source of funds is distributions from CGP LLC. To the extent that CAC requires additional funds, CAC may borrow funds or issue additional equity. However, as CAC does not have operations of its own, it is expected that CAC will not have a significant need for additional liquidity.\nCAC's expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including income tax obligations, are paid by CGP LLC on behalf of CAC pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CGP LLC. These transactions are accounted for as distributions from CGP LLC to CAC.\nCAC has not incurred, nor is it expected to incur, material capital expenditures in the normal course of business or to pursue acquisition opportunities other than through CGP LLC. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nPursuant to the certificate of incorporation of CAC and the CGP Operating Agreement, after October 21, 2016, Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to any transferee of all non-voting units of CGP LLC held by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, to acquire all or a portion of the voting units of\nCGP LLC (or, at the election of CAC, shares of CAC's Class A common stock) not otherwise owned by Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries at such time.\nFollowing October 21, 2018 and until April 21, 2022, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will have the right to cause a liquidation of CGP LLC, including the sale or winding up of CGP LLC, or other monetization of all of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds remaining after satisfaction of all liabilities of CGP LLC to the holders of CGP LLC's units according to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement. On April 21, 2022 (unless otherwise agreed by Caesars Entertainment and CAC), if our Board has not previously exercised its liquidation right, the CGP Operating Agreement provides that CGP LLC shall, and our Board shall cause CGP LLC to effect a liquidation. The conditions upon which the call right may be exercised, the distribution waterfall for net cash and other assets upon a liquidation, and other information related to the potential liquidation are further discussed in Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share to the CAC financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCAC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\nCertain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments will be subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based upon the historical experience of both Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n \u2022 the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and \n \u2022 different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.  When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from our estimates.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards such that an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We analyze our variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability, and financial agreements.\nBecause the equity holders in CGP LLC receive returns disproportionate to their voting interests and substantially all the activities of CGP LLC are related to Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity. Additionally, while CAC is the sole voting member of CGP LLC, CAC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of CGP LLC, and therefore we do not consolidate CGP LLC into our financial statements.\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which we have the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no consolidated subsidiaries.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nCAC's primary asset is its investment in CGP LLC. We review this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of our investment exceeds its estimated fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than our carrying value, and our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, CGP LLC, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience and the experience of Caesars Entertainment with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nStock-based Compensation\nCAC may grant stock-based compensation awards in CAC Class A common stock to certain officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Caesars Acquisition Company 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (\"the PIP Plan\"). The PIP Plan provides for the plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Caesars Acquisition Company (the \"Committee\"). CAC has granted restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and stock options to directors, certain of its officers and employees of CGP LLC subsidiaries. RSUs and stock options granted to directors and employees are equity-classified awards and are measured at their grant date fair value for accounting purposes. RSUs and stock options granted to individual consultants and advisors are measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CAC Financial Statements.\nCAESARS GROWTH PARTNERS, LLC AND PREDECESSOR GROWTH PARTNERS\nOverview\nCGP LLC used a portion of the cash proceeds from its October 21, 2013 sale of voting units to CAC to purchase from Caesars Entertainment (i) the equity interests of PHWLV, which holds the Planet Hollywood; (ii) its equity interest in Maryland Joint Venture, which is the entity that indirectly holds interests in Horseshoe Baltimore in Maryland, and (iii) a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager, which manages Planet Hollywood, and Caesars Baltimore Management Company LLC, which manages Horseshoe Baltimore. We refer to these transactions as the \"Purchase Transaction\" and the acquired net assets as the \"Purchased Assets.\" The Purchase Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Purchase Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Purchased Assets.\nAlso on October 21, 2013, Caesars Entertainment contributed to CGP LLC, in exchange for non-voting units, (i) Caesars Entertainment's equity interests in CIE, representing approximately 90.2% of the total issued and outstanding shares of CIE prior to giving effect to any options or warrants that were exercisable at that time and (ii) approximately $1.1 billion face value of aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by CEOC. CGP LLC refers to these transactions as the \"Contribution\nTransaction\" and these assets as the \"Contributed Assets.\" The Contribution Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Contribution Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Contributed Assets. CGP LLC's equity interests in CIE of 90.2% was reduced in November 2014 to 83.3% due to the conversion of the $47.7 million convertible promissory note issued by CIE to Rock Gaming LLC (\"Rock\"), in each case not giving effect to any options, warrants, restricted stock units and restricted stock.\nIn connection with the Purchase Transaction and the Contribution Transaction, CGP LLC entered into agreements with Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries to provide certain corporate shared services and back-office support and business advisory services to CAC and CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. We refer to the Purchase Transaction, Contribution Transaction and the entering into such agreements collectively as the \"Transactions.\" In addition, CGP LLC reimbursed Caesars Entertainment and CAC for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, and will use the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of voting units to CAC for general corporate purposes, including making strategic investments.\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a pre-determined threshold amount in 2015. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the aggregate fair market value of the subscription rights issued by Caesars Entertainment in the amount of approximately $21.1 million was restored to Caesars Entertainment through a return of all 10.75% paid-in kind senior notes and certain 5.75% senior notes previously issued by CEOC from CGP LLC to CEC.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC contributed the equity interests of PHWLV and a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager to CGPH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CGP LLC. Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc., which is a majority-owned subsidiary of CEC. On May 5, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Bally's Las Vegas, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under property management agreements entered into between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the CGPH subsidiary which owns each of these respective properties, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties.\nOn May 20, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) Harrah's New Orleans, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the Louisiana property management agreement entered between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the owners of Harrah's New Orleans and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to Harrah's New Orleans.\nCGPH paid $2.0 billion, less outstanding debt assumed, for the May 2014 transactions above.\nThe acquisitions of Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell and the contribution of Planet Hollywood to CGPH are herein referred to as the \"Acquired Properties.\"\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nIn May 2013, CIE acquired the World Series of Poker social and mobile game assets and intellectual property from Electronic Arts, Inc. In August 2013, CIE acquired an online game development business based in the Ukraine and in October 2013, CIE acquired the workforce, assets and intellectual property of an online gaming development group. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these transactions were not material to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners or CGP LLC.\nIn February 2014, CIE acquired substantially all of the assets of Pacific Interactive, creator and owner of the application House of Fun Slots. CIE recorded $30.5 million in contingent consideration as part of the purchase price allocation related to this acquisition. In March 2015, CIE paid $62.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nPresentation\nThe financial information for the periods presented reflect the financial statements of CGP LLC on a combined and consolidated basis, giving regard to all impacts of the October 21, 2013 and May 2014 transactions. The financial information up through October 21, 2013 does not reflect the impacts of those transactions, including the recording of non-controlling interest or the determination of taxes in accordance with the LLC structure of CGP LLC. Instead, this financial information, referred to herein as Predecessor Growth Partners, presents the combination of those assets and entities that were purchased by or\ncontributed to CGP LLC as derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment.\nAs a result of the May 2014 transactions described above, one or more indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC acquired Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Harrah's New Orleans from CEOC. Because these acquisitions were accounted for as transactions among entities under common control, the financial information herein has been recast to include the financial results for these properties as if those businesses were combined into the CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners reporting entities for all periods presented. Therefore, the financial information contained herein provides comparable operating results for all periods presented.\nFor financial reporting purposes, CGP LLC has two operating units: (1) Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. and (2) Casino Properties and Developments. CGP LLC's Interactive Entertainment operating unit consists of CIE, which is comprised of three distinct but complementary businesses: social and mobile games, World Series of Poker and regulated online real money gaming. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments operating unit consists of Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell and CGP LLC's interest in the Maryland Joint Venture.\nPerformance Metrics - Social and Mobile Games\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013, the CIE business generated 94.6%, 93.6% and 95.6%, respectively, of its revenues from its social and mobile games business. CIE measures the performance of its social and mobile games business by using key financial metrics including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and key operating metrics including Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users, Monthly Unique Users, Average Revenue per User, and Monthly Unique Payers. The following operating metrics help CIE to understand and measure the engagement levels of its players, the size of its audience and its reach.\nDaily Active Users. CIE defines Daily Active Users (\"DAU\") as the number of individuals who played one of its games during a particular day on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games on the same day is counted as two DAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks on the same day would be counted as two DAU. Average DAU for a particular period is the average of the DAU for each day during that period. CIE uses DAU as a measure of audience engagement.\nMonthly Active Users. CIE defines Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\") as the number of individuals who played a particular game in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games in the same 30-day period is counted as two MAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks in a 30-day period would be counted as two MAU. Average MAU for a particular period is the average of the MAU at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MAU as a measure of total game audience size.\nMonthly Unique Users. CIE defines Monthly Unique Users (\"MUU\") as the number of unique individuals who played any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who plays more than one of CIE's games in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUU. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing across multiple platforms, an individual who plays any of its games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUU in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the player. Because many of CIE's players play more than one game in a given 30-day period, MUU are always lower than MAU in any given time period. Average MUU for a particular period is the average of the MUU at each month-end during that period. CIE tracks MUU as a measure of total audience reach across its network of games.\nMonthly Unique Payers. CIE defines Monthly Unique Payers (\"MUP\") as the number of unique individuals who purchased virtual currency in any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who makes multiple purchases of virtual currency on more than one of CIE's games on a particular platform in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUP. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals purchasing virtual currency across multiple platforms, an individual who makes a purchase of virtual currency on any of CIE's games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUP in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the paying user. Average MUP for a particular period is the average of the MUP at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MUP as a measure of monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nAverage Revenue per User. CIE defines Average Revenue per User (\"ARPU\") as (i) the total revenue in a given period, (ii) divided by the number of days in that period, (iii) divided by the average DAU during the period. CIE believes that ARPU provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its results in the same manner as the Company's management and Board of Directors. CIE uses ARPU as a measure of overall monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nThe table below shows the results of CIE's social and mobile games business, using the operating metrics described above, for the periods indicated. User statistics are presented in thousands of users and ARPU is presented in dollars.\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Daily Active Users (2)\n</td> <td>6,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Active Users (2)\n</td> <td>19,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Users (2)\n</td> <td>18,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Monthly Unique Payers (2)\n</td> <td>819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Revenue Per User\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n (1) Metrics for 2013 present the aggregate of Predecessor Growth Partners for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, and for CGP LLC for the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 in order for the 2013 metrics to be comparable to 2015 and 2014. \n (2) CIE systems cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing games in multiple sessions in the same day or in a 30-day period ending with the measurement date, playing the same game across multiple platforms, or playing different titles offered by CIE. Thus, users who play multiple titles on multiple platforms may be counted as more than one user within the respective operating metrics.  Consistent with the social and mobile games business model, only a small portion of CIE's social and mobile games players pay for virtual goods. During 2015, CIE had approximately 819 thousand average MUP, or 4.5% of the total number of average MUU on the social and mobile platforms during this period, who purchased virtual goods. The opportunity for social interactions and player generated promotion increases as the overall number of players increase. As such, CIE believes that maintaining and growing its total number of players, irrespective of whether they purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of its business. The sale of virtual goods, however, constitutes the primary source of revenue for CIE's social and mobile games business. The degree to which game players choose to pay for virtual goods in the games is driven by CIE's ability to create content that enhances the game-play experience. CIE's revenue and overall financial performance are affected by the number of players and the effectiveness of its monetization of players through the sale of virtual goods.\nCIE's user metrics are impacted by several factors that cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Growth in the performance metrics is largely attributable to strong organic growth from CIE's games on both mobile and social platforms. Future growth in audience and engagement will depend on CIE's ability to retain current players, attract new players and expand into new markets and distribution platforms.\nThe tables below show the results of CIE's business based upon the financial metrics for the periods presented.\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CGP LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor Growth Partners\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 22 Through\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1 Through\nOctober 21, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Social and mobile games\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>725.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WSOP and online real money gaming\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below shows the revenue generated from CIE's social and mobile games business by geographic region for the periods listed and assumes that deferred revenues are spread proportionately across all geographies.

Net revenues for 2015 were $2,345.5 million as compared to $1,867.6 million in 2014, which was an improvement of $477.9 million, or 25.6%. The increase in revenues for CIE was primarily driven by strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games, as well as the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive. The increase in revenues for Casino Properties and Developments was primarily a result of the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino which was substantially completed and available to guests in early May 2015, and was partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans as a result of the April 2015 smoking ban.\nIncome from operations for 2015 was $483.0 million as compared to a loss of $108.0 million in 2014, which was an improvement of $591.0 million. The improvement in income from operations was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units in 2015, the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of the Horseshoe Baltimore. Excluding the impact of the change in fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units and the change in fair value of contingent consideration from both periods as well as the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas, income from operations for 2015 improved by $254.9 million primarily due to the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million for 2014, related to one of CIE's development studios in Minsk, Belarus which was disposed of in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2015 and 2014 was $632.3 million and $416.2 million, respectively. The increase of $216.1 million, or 51.9%, from prior year was driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet revenues for 2014 increased by $512.2 million, or 37.8%, compared with 2013, driven by strong performance in both operating units, including CIE's February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive and the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014.\nLoss from operations for 2014 was $108.0 million as compared with $23.3 million for 2013. The increase in loss from operations was primarily attributable to an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units to be issued to Caesars Entertainment pursuant to the terms of the Transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $77.1 million, or 22.7%, in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues.\nOperating Results\nInteractive Entertainment\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>CGP LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor Growth Partners\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 22 Through\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1 Through\nOctober 21, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>766.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>586.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income/(loss) from operations\n</td> <td>189.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income/(loss) from continuing operations\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td>282.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n (1) See Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations.

Income from operations increased by $168.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues, expense related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration recognized in the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by increased advertising expenses. Net loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million in 2014 due to CIE's suspension of operations of the Minsk development studio. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $105.7 million, or 59.7%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, driven by the income impact of increased revenues and reduced marketing expenses for online real money gaming.\nInteractive Entertainment net revenues increased by $270.2 million, or 85.3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, as a result of the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive, organic growth in the social and mobile games business and the full-year impact of online real money gaming in Nevada and New Jersey.

Performance of the Casino Properties and Developments operating unit is measured in part through tracking of trips by rated customers, which means a customer whose gaming activity is tracked through Caesars Entertainment's Total Rewards system, referred to as \"trips,\" and spend per rated customer trip, referred to as \"spend per trip.\" A trip is created by a Total\nRewards card holder engaging in one or more of the following activities while at our property: (1) hotel stay, (2) gaming activity or (3) a comp redemption, which means the receipt of a complimentary item given out by the casino. Lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program who stay at our property and non-lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program not staying at the property. Customer spend means the cumulative rated theoretical spend (which is the amount of money expected to be retained by the casino based upon the mathematics underlying the particular game as a fraction of the amount of money wagered by the customer) across all game types for a specific customer. The average combined gross hold is the percentage of the amount wagered across all game types (including table games and slot machines) that the casino retained.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2015 increased by $298.2 million, or 23.3%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, and by increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans due to the April 2015 smoking ban. Total trips increased approximately 25.8% in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily driven by the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nCasino revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $1,009.6 million and $799.9 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore and completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Gross casino hold also saw a positive variance, increasing from 11.2% in 2014 to 11.9% in 2015.\nRoom revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $323.2 million and $258.4 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenues was primarily due to the availability of rooms and increased rates as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, higher demand in the Las Vegas market and the increase in resort fees in late 2014. Cash average daily room rates for 2015 increased to approximately $123, or 13.9%, when compared to approximately $108 for the same period in 2014. Average daily occupancy was 92.4% and 89.7% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue per available room (\"RevPar\") for 2015 and 2014 was $112 and $98, respectively, or an increase of 14.3%.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $275.0 million and $245.5 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino in 2015 and new offerings that opened in 2014 across the portfolio including various new venues at The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nOther revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $162.9 million and $156.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore as well as increases in entertainment and retail revenue at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nIncome from operations was $193.2 million for 2015 as compared to loss from operations of $74.5 million in 2014. The improvement was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the income impact of increased revenues, offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 increased by $112.1 million, or 44.1%, when compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by increased revenues, partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by favorable casino hold of $12.6 million year over year.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2014 increased by $242.0 million, or 23.3%, when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the opening of The Cromwell in May 2014 and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014. For 2014, total rated trips increased by approximately 31.8% from 2013, driven by a 37.8% increase for non-lodgers, partially offset by a 4.7% decrease for lodgers. While spend per trip for lodgers and non-lodgers increased respectively, the shift to non-lodgers who typically spend less caused combined spend per trip to decline approximately 4.9%.\nCasino revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $799.9 million and $663.5 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell in 2014. Gross casino hold decreased from 11.5% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014.\nRoom revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $258.4 million and $241.0 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenue was primarily due to the introduction of resort fees and renovated rooms at Bally's Las Vegas and The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Cash average daily room rates for 2014 increased to $108, or approximately 25.6%, when compared to approximately $86 in 2013. Average daily occupancy was 89.7% in 2014 and 89.5% in 2013. RevPar for 2014 and 2013 was $98 and $82, respectively, or an increase of 19.5%. The revenue impact of favorable trends in room metrics was mostly offset by a lower number of rooms available due to room renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $245.5 million and $200.6 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by new offerings that opened in 2014 such as various new venues at Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nOther revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $156.6 million and $94.0 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the opening of Drai's at The Cromwell and enhanced entertainment options at the new Axis Theater at Planet Hollywood.\nLoss from operations was $74.5 million for 2014 as compared to income from operations of $139.1 million in 2013. Income impact of increased revenues was more than offset by the combination of an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, increased expenses at The LINQ Hotel & Casino primarily due to its strip-front lease, and increased pre-opening expenses associated with Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $10.7 million, or 4.4%, for 2014 when compared with 2013 primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues.\nIncentives are often provided for customers to stay and play at our properties.

CGP LLC's provision for income taxes also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. No provision for income taxes is reported for properties within the Casino Properties and Developments operating unit of CGP LLC that were acquired in 2013 as such properties are taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes whereby any income or losses were allocated to the CGP LLC members and taxed by each member. Predecessor Growth Partners' income taxes represent the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns, and does not recognize the pass-through entity structure of CGP LLC. \n (2) CGP LLC's non-controlling interest reflects the non-controlling interest associated with consolidating CIE and the Maryland Joint Venture into CGP LLC. As the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners were prepared on a combined basis rather than a consolidated basis, the non-controlling interest associated with CIE is not included within the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners.

The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. During the third quarter of 2014, CGP LLC sold a portion of the notes to CEOC and distributed the remaining notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC.\nImpairment of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to release losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nGain on Sale of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the Note Purchase Agreement and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Planet Hollywood secured loan contained excess cash flow provisions which required mandatory prepayments when certain conditions were met. Prepayments in excess of the recorded book value of principal owed were recorded in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations of CGP LLC and Combined Statements of Operations for Predecessor Growth Partners. Inclusive of the impact of the loan payoff in conjunction with the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement as defined in Intercreditor Agreement and Collateral Agreements section of Note 7- Debt to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $23.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. There was no Loss on extinguishment of debt recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Other income, net was $3.9 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in Other income, net for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to CIE's gain recognized on a contract termination.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCGP LLC\nThe provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its subsidiary, CIE, which is taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes. CGP LLC's provision for income taxes also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. The provision for income taxes for CGP LLC differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level.\nThe effective tax rates for December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 21.3% and (32.9)%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level in 2015 versus CGP LLC losses not tax benefitted at the CGP LLC entity level in 2014.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nThe provision for income taxes represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. The provision for income taxes for the periods presented differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations partially offset by nondeductible stock-based compensation and nondeductible expenses, including lobbying expenditures and professional fees. The effective tax rate for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013 was 35.8%.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax\nIn June 2014, CIE concluded that, effective August 2014, it would suspend operations of its Minsk development studio. As a result, CIE recorded an impairment of $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2014, CIE settled its accrued contingent consideration liability for $4.5 million and recognized a gain of $1.4 million on the final disposition of the entity. CGP LLC has presented the operations of the Minsk development studio as discontinued operations in CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Loss/(Income) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nCGP LLC\nCGP LLC's non- controlling interest reflects the non-controlling interest associated with consolidating CIE and the Maryland Joint Venture into CGP LLC. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Caesars Interactive for 2015 was $20.2 million. For 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, net loss of $4.5 million and $0.9 million\nwas attributable to non-controlling interests in CIE for the respective period. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the Maryland Joint Venture was $13.1 million, $28.5 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, respectively.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nAs the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners were prepared on a combined basis rather than a consolidated basis, the non-controlling interest associated with CIE is not included within the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners. For the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, net loss attributed to non-controlling interests related to losses in the Maryland Joint Venture and CIE was $5.1 million and zero, respectively.\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its financial performance. EBITDA is comprised of net income before (i) interest expense, net of capitalized interest, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, further adjusted for certain items that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners do not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance.\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure below. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information that allows for an understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of capital investment decisions made for the long-term benefit of CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td>

Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Spending\nCGP LLC incurs capital expenditures in the normal course of business, performs ongoing refurbishment and maintenance at its existing casino entertainment facilities, and periodically expands and enhances the information technology infrastructure required to operate its social and mobile games in order to maintain their quality standards. Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available from cash flows generated by operating activities while cash used for development projects is typically funded from specific project financing and additional debt offerings. CGP LLC may also pursue acquisition opportunities for additional businesses or social or mobile games that meet its strategic and return on investment criteria.\nCGP LLC's capital spending and maintenance, if they go forward, could require significant capital commitments and, if completed, may result in significant additional revenues. The commitment of capital, the timing of completion, and the commencement of operations of development projects are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of requisite approvals from the applicable political and regulatory bodies. Excluding amounts spent for the purchases of businesses, CGP LLC's cash used for capital spending for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 was $174.5 million, $568.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively. Predecessor Growth Partners' cash used for capital spending for the period from January 1, 2013 through October 21, 2013 totaled $156.6 million.\nThe majority of the 2015 capital spending related to the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. The LINQ Hotel & Casino began opening a portion of the Phase II renovations in March 2015 and it was substantially completed in early May 2015. The majority of the 2014 and 2013 capital spending related to The Cromwell which was completed and reopened in the second quarter of 2014, Horseshoe Baltimore which opened in August 2014, and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The LINQ Hotel & Casino were $112.0 million, $111.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The Cromwell were $139.0 million and $58.6 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, capital expenditures net of related payables for Horseshoe Baltimore was $258.6 million.\nLiquidity\nCGP LLC and its subsidiaries' primary sources of liquidity include currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from its operations and borrowings under the $150.0 million CGPH revolving credit agreement (\"CGPH Revolving Credit Facility\") which is intended to satisfy CGPH's short-term liquidity needs. CGP LLC's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $901.7 million and $944.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of total cash and cash equivalents, Caesars Interactive had $99.1 million and $92.1 million in foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Caesars Interactive may use the cash in its subsidiaries outside the U.S. to repay debt payable to related parties, fund operations at these subsidiaries, pursue international acquisitions, or repatriate the cash to the United States.\nPayments of short-term debt obligations and other commitments are expected to be made from operating cash flows. Long-term obligations are expected to be paid through operating cash flows, refinancing of existing debt or the issuance of new debt, or, if necessary, additional investments from its equity holders. CGP LLC's operating cash inflows are used for operating expenses, debt service costs, repurchase of equity from CIE's management shareholders, working capital needs and capital expenditures in the normal course of business. CGP LLC's ability to refinance debt will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, CGP LLC's financial performance, and the limitations applicable to such transactions under CGP LLC's and its subsidiaries' financing documents. Additionally, CGP LLC's ability to fund operations, pay debt obligations, and fund planned capital expenditures depends, in part, upon economic and other factors that are beyond CGP LLC's control, and disruptions in capital markets and restrictive covenants related to CGP LLC's existing debt could impact CGP LLC's ability to fund liquidity needs, pay indebtedness and secure additional funds through financing activities.\nCGP LLC's restricted cash totaled $12.5 million and $40.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include amounts restricted under the terms of the Baltimore Credit Facility and the Cromwell Credit Facility, as defined below. The classification of restricted cash between current and long-term is dependent upon the intended use of each particular reserve.\nIssuers issued $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 9.375% second-priority senior secured notes due 2022 pursuant to an indenture dated as of April 17, 2014, among the Issuers and US Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Indenture\").

See Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants related to debt instruments.\nDuring the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, Propco failed to meet the covenant of achieving consolidated EBITDA of at least $7.5 million. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows CGP LLC to cure this covenant by making a cash cure payment. Such payments were made on March 31, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and on May 22, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows this right to cure provided that (i) in each eight-fiscal-quarter period there shall be no more than five fiscal quarters in which the cure right is exercised and (ii) the cure right may not be exercised in any fiscal quarter that immediately follows two consecutive fiscal quarters in which it was exercised.\nThe CGPH Term Loan also provides for a $150.0 million revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). As of December 31, 2015, $45.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million was committed to outstanding letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has a contractual maturity of greater than one year and CGPH has the ability to repay the outstanding principal balances beyond the next 12 months. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility are intended to satisfy short-term liquidity needs and are classified in Current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On January 21, 2016, CGPH drew an additional $15.0 million of borrowings on its $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Horseshoe Baltimore Credit Facility also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit agreement with a five-year maturity that remained undrawn at December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 7 - Debt of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for further details.\nCIE Credit Facility\nCaesars Interactive entered into a credit facility whereby Caesars Entertainment provided to Caesars Interactive unsecured intercompany loans as requested by CIE and approved by Caesars Entertainment on an individual transaction basis. No principal payments were required on the unsecured intercompany loans until their maturity date of November 29, 2016. The unsecured intercompany loans bore interest on the unpaid principal amounts at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5%. This credit facility did not have any restrictive or affirmative covenants. The outstanding balance on the credit facility was\n$39.8 million as of December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repaid in full the $39.8 million outstanding balance.\nRock Promissory Notes\nIn March 2012, Rock and CIE entered into an agreement pursuant to which Rock purchased approximately 6,155 shares of CIE common stock for $30.4 million in cash and agreed to purchase additional shares of CIE common stock on or before July 2, 2012. CIE used the proceeds from this sale to prepay a portion of the then outstanding balance on the credit facility. In June 2012, CIE and Rock modified the agreement with Rock such that CIE issued to Rock approximately 382 shares of CIE common stock and a promissory note for $28.5 million in exchange for $30.4 million in cash. The promissory note was convertible into approximately 5,773 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. In November 2012, CIE issued to Rock an additional promissory note for $19.2 million in exchange for $19.2 million in cash. The additional promissory note was convertible into approximately 3,140 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. Both promissory notes automatically converted into 8,913 shares of CIE common stock in November 2014.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. Upon the October 21, 2013 closing of the Transactions, CGP LLC recorded a liability of $167.8 million representing the estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units. The estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units was adjusted to $228.0 million and $345.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The change in fair value was a decrease of $117.2 million for 2015 and an increase of $38.7 million for 2014, respectively, which was reported within the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nAt December 31, 2013, CGP LLC owned $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of the CEOC Notes.\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of notes previously issued by CEOC as a dividend to its members, pro rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. CAC, as a member of CGP LLC and the holder of 42.4% of the economic interests in CGP LLC at the time of the Notes Distribution, received in connection with the Notes Distribution $137.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes and $151.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes.\nOther Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes CGP LLC's contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2015.

This amount does not include estimated obligations for future performances where payment is only guaranteed when the performances occur and/or is based on factors contingent upon the profitability of the performances.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCGP LLC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners prepare their financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Certain accounting policies, including the estimated consumption rate of virtual goods that is used for revenue recognition in the social and mobile games business, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, the valuation of contingent consideration, the valuation of contingently issuable non-voting membership units, and the evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, require that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' significant accounting policies, please refer to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the CGP LLC consolidated financial statements and Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Predecessor Growth Partners combined financial statements.\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n \u2022 the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and \n \u2022 different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.  When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners select the principle or method that they consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires them to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners have made their best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nCGP LLC consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC analyzes its variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. CGP LLC's analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on CGP LLC's review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. Based on current analysis, Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC, has an ownership interest in CR Baltimore Holdings (\"CRBH\"), a variable interest entity. Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of CRBH and therefore consolidates CRBH into its financial statements. As Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC is wholly-owned by CGP LLC, CGP LLC therefore also consolidates the CRBH variable interest.\nCGP LLC also consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which CGP LLC has the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method.\nCGP LLC's consolidated financial statements include the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\nUp through and including October 21, 2013, Predecessor Growth Partners combined into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Predecessor Growth Partners analyzed its variable interests to determine if the entity that was party to the variable interest was a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. Based on the analyses, Predecessor Growth Partners was the primary beneficiary, and therefore had included the Horseshoe Baltimore development project in Maryland, a variable interest entity, in its combined financial statements.\nPredecessor Growth Partners' combined financial statements include the accounts of Predecessor Growth Partners and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. These combined financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that Predecessor Growth Partners had the ability to control.\nApplication of Acquisition Method Accounting\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to the former owners of Buffalo Studios to settle the contingent obligation.\nOn February 13, 2014, CIE acquired 100% of the voting and economic interest in Pacific Interactive, a company based in the United Kingdom. Aggregate consideration was $51.8 million, including CIE's preliminary estimate of $30.5 million in contingent consideration. Pacific Interactive is the operator of House of Fun Slots, which is among the leading social and mobile casino-themed games on Facebook, iOS, and Android platforms. Similar to CIE's legacy games, Pacific Interactive offers its games under a \"free-to-play\" model in which users can download and play the game for free, but are charged for additional game coins and other virtual consumable goods.\nCIE applied the acquisition method of accounting to these business combinations, which required the company to identify the acquiring entity, determine the appropriate acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, and recognize and measure goodwill.\nThe application of the acquisition method accounting guidance had the following effects on its consolidated financial statements: (i) CIE measured the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions and recognized such in CGP LLC's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014; (ii) CIE reported the operating results of Buffalo Studios in Predecessor Growth Partners' combined statements of operations and cash flows for the period ended October 21, 2013 as well as in CGP LLC's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to October 21, 2013; and (iii) CIE reported the operating results of Pacific Interactive subsequent to its acquisition date.\nCIE engaged independent third-party valuation expertise to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as the established user base, the game engine and the developed games, and in the fair value determination of any other significant tangible assets or liabilities, such as long-lived property. Enterprise value allocation methodology requires that management make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. If actual amounts significantly differ from the estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, the resulting difference can materially affect the fair value of net assets.\nCIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Buffalo Studios' assets of approximately $52.9 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $2.1 million, excluding contingent consideration. CIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Pacific Interactive's assets of approximately $64.2 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $12.4 million, excluding contingent consideration.\nInvestment in CES\nInvestment in CES consists of membership interests in CES which is a variable interest entity of which CGP LLC owns less than 20% and is not the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC does not exercise significant influence over the variable interest entity and therefore accounts for the investment using the cost method (see Note 19 - Related Party Transactions to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1). CGP LLC reviews this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, CGP LLC considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of CGP LLC's investment exceeds its estimated fair value, CGP LLC evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than CGP LLC's carrying value, and CGP LLC's intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. CGP LLC also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established. CGP LLC did not recognize an impairment charge in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 on this investment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCGP LLC has significant capital invested in its long-lived assets and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in the financial results and whether CGP LLC has a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. CGP LLC assigns lives to its assets based on its standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. CGP LLC reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management\nin performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the asset group level, which, for most of CGP LLC's assets, is the individual property.\nGoodwill and Other Non-Amortizing Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners determined the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. CGP LLC also evaluates, and Predecessor Growth Partners also evaluated, the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in CGP LLC's industry.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed an annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of September 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of October 1 or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of non-amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the \"Relief from Royalty Method\" and \"Excess Earnings Method\" under the income approach.\nThe annual evaluation of goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results, valuation multiples, and discount rates to determine their fair value. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect these estimates. Thus, to the extent the gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or CGP LLC does not meet its projected performance, CGP LLC could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets have been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC had approximately $302.5 million in total book value of goodwill and $260.7 million of other non-amortizing intangible assets that are at risk of further partial or total impairment should CGP LLC experience minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions in the future. Of this amount, $237.0 million is allocated to Planet Hollywood, Harrah's New Orleans and CIE reporting units. These reporting units have estimated fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values and therefore, are not at risk of partial or total impairment outside of drastic, unforeseen circumstances. Specifically, Planet Hollywood's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 189.1%, Harrah's New Orleans' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 34.7%, and CIE's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 951.0%. $65.5 million of goodwill is allocated to our Bally's Las Vegas reporting unit, at which we recorded impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, Bally's Las Vegas' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 13.8%. Thus, to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis. Impairment charges related to goodwill or intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized in impairment of goodwill or impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nInteractive Entertainment-Social and Mobile Games\nCIE derives revenue from the sale of virtual goods within casino-themed social and mobile games which are played on various global social and mobile third-party platforms. CIE's largest application, Slotomania, represented 48.5%, 51.0% and 63.6% of CIE's social and mobile games revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCIE's social and mobile games operate on a free-to-play model, whereby game players may collect virtual currency or other virtual consumable goods (collectively referred to as \"virtual goods\" or \"virtual currency\") free of charge through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players have the ability to send free \"gifts\" of virtual goods to their friends through interactions with certain social platforms. If a game player wishes to obtain virtual goods above\nand beyond the level of free virtual goods available to that player, the player may purchase additional virtual goods. Once a purchase is completed, the virtual goods are deposited into the player's account and are not separately identifiable from previously purchased virtual goods or virtual goods obtained by the game player for free.\nOnce obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play. When virtual currency is played in the games, the game player could \"win\" and would be awarded additional virtual currency, or could \"lose\" and lose the future use of that virtual currency. As the game player does not receive any additional benefit from the games, nor is the game player entitled to any additional rights once the game player's virtual goods are substantially consumed, CIE has concluded that the virtual goods represent consumable goods.\nCIE has determined through a review of customer play behavior that game players who purchase virtual currency generally are not purchasing additional virtual currency if their existing virtual goods balances have not been substantially consumed. As CIE is able to track the duration between purchases of virtual currency for individual game players, CIE is able to reliably estimate the period of time over which virtual currency is consumed. As such, CIE recognizes revenue using an item-based revenue model.\nBecause CIE is unable to distinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency, CIE must estimate the amount of outstanding purchased virtual currency at each reporting period based on customer behavior. Based upon an analysis of the customers' historical play behavior, the timing difference between when virtual currencies are purchased by a customer and when those virtual currencies are consumed in gameplay is relatively short. CIE records within Other current liabilities the deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games, and also records within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CIE had deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games of $3.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, recorded within Other current liabilities on CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. CIE also recorded within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue, aggregating $1.2 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCIE continues to gather detailed customer play behavior and assesses this data in relation to its revenue recognition policy. To the extent the customer play behavior changes, CIE reassesses its estimates and assumptions used for revenue recognition.\nCIE's games are played on various social and mobile third-party platforms for which such third parties collect monies from CIE's customers and pay CIE an amount after deducting a platform fee. CIE is the primary obligor with its customers, and under most of these arrangements, retains the ability to establish the pricing for its virtual currencies and assumes all credit risk with its customers.\nBased upon the above facts, CIE recognizes the majority of its revenues from its game-playing customers on a gross basis and related platform fees are recorded as a component of operating expense.\nPrior to September 2013, transactions conducted through the Facebook platform were facilitated using Facebook credits (\"FB Credits\"), which is a form of virtual currency specific to the Facebook platform. Effectively, transactions priced by CIE to sell a specified number of virtual goods for a specified cost in a game player's local currency had FB Credits inserted into the transaction flow, whereby the purchase price paid by the game player was first converted to FB Credits, and the FB Credits were then converted into the resulting number of virtual goods. This provided a means for Facebook platform users to accumulate FB Credits prior to making an in-application purchase, and for the Facebook platform to provide to its users FB Credits at a discount or for free.\nSubsequent to the September 2013 elimination of FB Credits, Facebook may provide free gift cards or determine other means of discounting virtual currencies purchased by the Facebook platform users. As a result, CIE reviews the individual transaction details to ensure that revenues recognized for the sale of virtual currencies through the Facebook platform represent cash paid for such currencies by CIE's game players.\nTaxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. This instrument was considered a derivative instrument. Therefore, the balance of this liability was adjusted to reflect the expected number of non-voting units to be issued at the current estimated fair value of those units at each reporting date. Both the estimate of the number of units to be issued and the estimated fair value of non-voting units at the reporting date fall into Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the\nContingently issuable non-voting membership units payable was forecasted earnings. Significant changes in forecasted earnings would have resulted in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nStock-based Compensation\nIn addition to the CAC Equity Plan, Caesars Entertainment grants stock-based compensation awards in Caesars Entertainment common stock to certain employees that work for the management companies of the casino properties under the Caesars 2012 Performance Incentive Plan.\nCIE grants stock-based compensation awards in CIE common stock to its employees and service providers in accordance with the Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. Amended and Restated Management Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is intended to promote the interests of CIE and its shareholders by providing key employees, directors, service providers and consultants with an incentive to encourage their continued employment or service and improve the growth and profitability of CIE. The Plan provides for the Plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee (\"HRC\") of the Committee. As a matter of policy, the exercise price of all options granted under the Plan has been determined by the Committee to ensure that the exercise price of options granted under the Plan complies with the requirement that such exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying shares at the respective grant dates.\nIn February 2014, the Committee approved a liquidity plan, setting forth the terms and conditions upon which CIE may elect to purchase, or cause to be purchased, CIE owned shares and/or shares underlying options, RSUs, restricted stock or warrants (\"deemed held shares\") held by eligible individuals, from time to time, during the term of the plan, and providing the eligible individuals with a market for their CIE shares and/or deemed held shares (the \"Liquidity Plan\").\nThe following is a description of the components of these programs under the Plan as of December 31, 2015:\nStock Options and Warrants\nTime-based stock options and warrants have been granted to employees and non-employees, and are subject to graded vesting periods ranging from three to seven years. Vesting is subject to the participant's continued employment or service, through the applicable vesting date.\nAll warrants to non-employees and the majority of the stock options to employees and non-employees contain a call option, at a fixed amount, which is exercisable by CIE. Since the embedded call feature is at a fixed price, the call feature could result in a repurchase amount that is less than the fair value of the underlying shares. Therefore, these options and warrants are liability-classified instruments and are measured at fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. Prior to 2014, options without the call provision were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. All unexercised options and warrants expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.\nAs described above, the Committee approved the Liquidity Plan to provide offers to repurchase certain awards and CIE shares from participants of the Plan. For accounting purposes, the provisions of the Liquidity Plan were deemed to modify the awards underlying the Plan. Effectively, the Company has determined to account for the subject stock options and warrants as if CIE has a conditional obligation to settle such options in cash at some future date pursuant to the Liquidity Plan. However, (i) the Liquidity Plan is fully at CIE's discretion, (ii) requires additional approval by the HRC for all future purchases and (iii) makes no commitment that any specific employees will be permitted to participate in future shares or deemed share purchases, if any. As a result of this modification, all outstanding options and warrants granted under the Plan were modified to be accounted for as liability-classified awards at December 31, 2015.\nCertain CIE employees have been granted CIE stock options with vesting conditions achieved upon CIE meeting certain consolidated earnings targets. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost recorded over the estimated service period implied by the particular performance target pertaining to each tranche of awards.\nCertain non-employees have been granted CIE stock options which initially contained vesting conditions associated with the legalization and implementation of online gaming in the U.S. Under the original grant agreements, these stock options were to vest based on conditions other than market, performance or service conditions and therefore were recorded as liability-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. These stock options were modified during 2015 to remove such vesting conditions and to instead subject the awards to graded three year vesting from the date of modification. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph, and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost to be recognized ratably by CIE over the amended three-year vesting schedule.\nRestricted Shares and RSU's\nCertain key employees of a subsidiary of CIE have been granted restricted shares which became fully vested during 2014 and which were reclassified to equity in 2015.\nCertain key CIE employees have been granted RSUs, which are subject to vesting periods ranging from two to seven years. For RSU awards subject to a seven-year vesting period, 25% of the award vests ratably over four years, 25% vests ratably over 5 years, 25% vests ratably over six years and 25% vests ratably over seven years. The remaining RSUs are subject to either cliff vesting, whereby 100% of the award vests once the service period has been met, or graded vesting, whereby the award vests ratably over the service period.\nFor the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, restricted shares and RSUs were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. Restricted shares and RSUs were subject to the provisions of the Liquidity Plan as described above and were deemed modified in 2014. As a result of this modification, the Company reversed any previously recorded expense in 2014 and any outstanding restricted shares and RSUs were recorded at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. If an RSU is not repurchased within six months and one day of vesting, the award will be reclassified to equity and CIE will no longer record the award at fair value.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $5,221 to $5,446 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $8,000 to $10,710 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $12,630 to $15,340 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $54.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring January and February 2016, CIE repurchased shares at a price of $15,740 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $26.7 million during January and February 2016.\nValuation of CIE Common Stock\nCIE determines the value of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the \"Practice Aid\") with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, and taking into account facts and circumstances specific to each quarter. Given the relative independence of the components of the entity, the valuation specialists, performed sum of the parts valuations which used a combination of market-based and income-based approaches for the various business components to determine the value of each component of the business, and then aggregated these component values to arrive at the estimated business enterprise value.\nAfter concluding on a business enterprise value, that value is converted into an equity value by subtracting the debt on the balance sheets as of each valuation date. The resultant equity value was divided by the number of outstanding common shares and in-the-money options and warrants at each valuation date to determine the fair value of an individual share of common stock.\nThe valuation specialists also considered the appropriate premiums and discounts that must be assessed in relation to the valuation of CIE's common stock supporting the outstanding options and warrants. The majority of CIE's common stock is owned by CGP LLC. As such, any shares obtained pursuant to options and warrants will have the same inability to control or influence decisions that are subject to shareholder approval as the shares that were obtained in the first quarter 2012 arms-length sale of CIE's common stock to an independent investor and in the fourth quarter sale of CIE's common stock pursuant to the third-party investor's exercise of their purchase option. As such, the common stock valuation methodology used for purposes of valuing stock options did not require any additional discount for lack of control.\nHaving taken the above considerations into account, the fair value of CIE's common stock was then used by an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of CIE's options and warrants.\nShare-based Payments to Non-Employees of CAC or CGP LLC\nOn April 9, 2014, the Board approved the CAC Equity-Based Compensation Plan for CEC Employees for officers and employees of CEC and its subsidiaries as well as certain other individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. CEC will administer the Equity Plan. Under the Equity Plan, CEC is authorized to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, cash awards, rights to purchase or acquire shares or similar securities in the form of or with a value related to our common stock to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. The Equity Plan will terminate ten years\nafter approval by the Board. Subject to adjustments in connection with certain changes in capitalization, the maximum value of the shares of our Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards under the Equity Plan is $25.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2014, CEC granted awards to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries in accordance with the Equity Plan in order to reward and provide incentive for services provided in their capacity, promote the success of CGP LLC and more closely align the interests of such individuals with those of the stockholders of the Company. Awards under this plan vest one-third on each of October 21, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Expense associated with the vesting of such awards is recorded as management fee expense by CGP LLC, totaling $11.9 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, such shares will be contributed to CGP LLC by CAC as additional investment into that entity, at which time CGP LLC will settle its management fee obligation with CEC and its subsidiaries through a distribution of such shares to CEC. Also upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, CGP LLC will issue an equivalent number of voting units in CGP LLC and distribute those units to CAC. As CAC will receive voting units in CGP LLC in exchange for the shares of CAC issued pursuant to this plan, there is no expected dilutive impact to CAC's Earnings per Share (\"EPS\") (see Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share).\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nPredecessor Growth Partners' investments in senior notes of approximately $1.1 billion, issued by CEOC, a related party, were classified as available for sale investments and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. Any discount or premium was amortized to interest income using the effective interest method. CGP LLC classified the investment in notes from related party as current or long-term depending on the maturity of the instruments along with management's intent on holding such instruments.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to recognize losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nCGP LLC records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. CGP LLC reduces the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, CGP LLCs' experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFor periods reported through October 21, 2013, the provision for income taxes for Predecessor Growth Partners represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. For the period from October 22, 2013 through May 2014, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE, which was taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, and also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. For periods subsequent to the May 2014 acquisitions, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 and under Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Predecessor Growth Partners Combined Financial Statements.\nOther Items\nFormation of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC\nCES, a services joint venture among CEOC, CERP, a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, and CGPH, manages CGP LLC's properties and provides CGP LLC with access to Caesars Entertainment's management expertise, intellectual property, back office services and Total Rewards loyalty program. CES also employs personnel under each property's corresponding property management agreement. Operating expenses are allocated to each Member with respect to their respective properties serviced by CES in accordance with historical allocation methodologies, subject to annual revisions and certain prefunding requirements. Corporate expenses that are not allocated to the properties directly are allocated by CES to CEOC, CERP, and CGPH according to their allocation percentages (initially 70.0%, 24.6% and 5.4%, respectively), subject to annual review. As a result of an annual review undertaken in September 2015 but effective July 2015, the allocation percentages were revised to 65.4%, 21.8% and 12.8%, respectively. CGPH has notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objects to the new expense allocation but will pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserves all rights. On October 1, 2014, CES began operations in Nevada, Louisiana and certain other jurisdictions in which regulatory approval had been received or was not required, including through the commencement of direct employment by CES of certain designated enterprise-wide employees.\nOmnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement\nOn May 20, 2014, the Members entered into the Omnibus Agreement, which granted licenses to the Members and certain of their affiliates in connection with the formation of CES. Initial contributions by the Members included a $22.5 million cash payment by CGP LLC on behalf of CGPH in October 2014. Pursuant to a capital call during the three months ended December 31, 2014, CGP LLC contributed an additional $0.1 million on behalf of CGPH. Pursuant to capital calls during the year ended December 31, 2015, CGPH contributed an additional $3.9 million to CES. On October 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, the Members transitioned certain executives and employees to CES and the services of such employees were available as part of CES's provision of services to the Members and certain of their affiliates that own properties that require CES services under the Omnibus Agreement.\nUnder the Omnibus Agreement, CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and certain of their subsidiaries that granted CES a non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free license in and to all intellectual property owned or used by such licensors, including all intellectual property (a) currently used, or contemplated to be used, in connection with the properties owned by the Members and their respective affiliates, including any and all intellectual property related to the Total Rewards program, and (b) necessary for the provision of services contemplated by the Omnibus Agreement and by the applicable management agreement for any such property (collectively, the \"Enterprise Assets\").\nCES granted to the properties owned or controlled by the Members, and their respective affiliates, non-exclusive licenses to the Enterprise Assets. CES granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and the properties owned or controlled by the Members licenses to any intellectual property that CES develops or acquires in the future that is not a derivative of the intellectual property licensed to it. CES also granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI and CGPH a non-exclusive license to intellectual property specific to the properties controlled by CGPH, CERP and their subsidiaries for any uses consistent with the uses made by CEOC, CLC, and CWI with respect to such intellectual property prior to the date of the Omnibus Agreement.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited financial statements and the notes thereto of CAC, Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC (all as defined below), and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 of this Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation and Discussion\nCaesars Acquisition Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 25, 2013 and was formed to own 100% of the voting membership units in CGP LLC, a joint venture between CAC and subsidiaries of CEC. On October 21, 2013, the joint venture was formed through the execution of the series of Transactions described in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the CAC financial statements. Following consummation of the Transactions, CAC serves as CGP LLC's managing member and sole holder of all of its outstanding voting units, and subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment hold all of CGP LLC's outstanding non-voting units. However, based upon the structure of CGP LLC and the related economics, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity of which Caesars Entertainment is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, CAC does not consolidate CGP LLC into its financial statements. Instead, CAC accounts for its investment in CGP LLC using a balance sheet approach to the equity method of accounting, referred to as hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") accounting.\nCAC's primary asset is its membership interest in CGP LLC. The assets and entities that were acquired by or contributed to CGP LLC in connection with the Transactions (referred to in the aggregate as Predecessor Growth Partners) are considered to be the predecessor to CAC. The combined historical financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and, as the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction are considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control, have been derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment. The combined historical financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses and assets contributed to or acquired by CGP LLC in the Transactions, the Acquired Properties Transaction and the Harrah's Transaction described previously as if those businesses were combined into a single reporting entity for all periods presented.\nIn addition to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners, we have also presented financial statements of CGP LLC for the period subsequent to the Transactions pursuant to Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, as CGP LLC represents a significant equity method investment of CAC. As the basis of presentation for all items other than income taxes, non-controlling interests and senior notes returned to Caesars Entertainment related to the subscription right restoration is the same between Predecessor Growth Partners and CGP LLC, and because we believe that the full year 2015 and 2014 information compared with the full year 2013 information for CAC's investment in CGP LLC is material to investors in CAC, we have presented information for both CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\nProposed Merger of CAC with CEC\nOn December 21, 2014, the Company and CEC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company.\nPursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, and subject to the overall restructuring of CEOC, regulatory approval and other closing conditions, upon consummation of the Proposed Merger, each share of class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of CAC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Proposed Merger will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, that number of shares of CEC common stock, par value $0.01 per share, equal to 0.664, provided that during the Adjustment Period (as described below), the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee, each composed solely of independent directors, will determine if there should be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio and the amount of any such adjustment, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances affecting the intrinsic value of CAC and CEC. The Adjustment Period is the 14 day period beginning on the later of (i) the date that the CEOC restructuring plan is confirmed and (ii) the date that both CAC and CEC confirm that their respective independent financial advisors have received all information as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in order to render a fairness opinion concerning the Exchange Ratio. If at the end of the Adjustment Period, the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee have not agreed to an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, there will not be an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio. Within five business days following the end of the Adjustment Period, either CAC or CEC may terminate the Merger Agreement if (a) the CAC Special Committee and the CEC Special Committee cannot agree on an Exchange Ratio adjustment and a failure to terminate the Merger Agreement would be inconsistent with their respective directors' fiduciary duties or (b) the CAC Special Committee or the CEC Special Committee, as applicable, has not received an opinion of its respective financial advisor that the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted, if applicable) is fair, from a financial point of view to CAC and its public stockholders or CEC, as\napplicable. Under the Merger Agreement, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger has not been completed by the close of business on August 6, 2016.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, CEC has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the implementation of the restructuring of certain of CEC's subsidiaries as contemplated by that certain Restructuring Support and Forbearance Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2014, among CEOC, CEC, LeverageSource III (H Holdings), L.P., LeverageSource V, L.P. and each of the holders of first lien bond claims party thereto and (ii) consult with CAC regarding certain additional actions in connection with the bankruptcy filing contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement if CEC determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such additional actions could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to CAC.\nCAESARS ACQUISITION COMPANY\nOperating Results\nIncome from Equity Method Investment\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, CAC recognized $97.4 million, $79.4 million and $7.3 million, respectively, of income before tax from its equity method investment in CGP LLC, which equals the amount of income that CAC was entitled to under its minimum guaranteed return. The minimum guaranteed return subsequent to May 2014 includes return earned on capital deployed in connection with the May 2014 acquisitions of JCC Holding Company II, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"Harrah's New Orleans\"), 3535 LV Corporation, (\"The LINQ Hotel & Casino\"), indirect subsidiaries of Parball Corporation (collectively known as \"Bally's Las Vegas\"), and Corner Investment Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (\"The Cromwell\") by indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC. The minimum guaranteed return also reflects a reduction in the amount of deployed capital upon which such return is earned, equal to the fair value of senior notes distributed from CGP LLC to CAC on August 6, 2014.\nOperating Expenses\nIn addition to its income from equity method investment, CAC incurred direct expenses of $31.2 million, $25.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013, respectively, primarily related to professional services fees, as well as general liability insurance, licenses and fees. Operating expenses for 2015 increased by $5.8 million, or 22.8%, when compared with 2014 primarily due to professional services fees mainly driven by an increase in legal and advisory fees. Other expenses for 2014 increased by $25.0 million when compared with 2013 primarily due to professional services fees mainly for the preparation for the Acquired Properties Transaction and Harrah's Transaction. CAC receives distributions from CGP LLC in accordance with the CGP Operating Agreement for reimbursement of its expenses incurred.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from February 25, 2013 through December 31, 2013 was $34.2 million, $39.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The effective tax rates for December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are 51.7%, 72.9% and 34.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to a lesser change in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the federal valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to the basis difference in the investment in notes from related party.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCAC's primary source of funds is distributions from CGP LLC. To the extent that CAC requires additional funds, CAC may borrow funds or issue additional equity. However, as CAC does not have operations of its own, it is expected that CAC will not have a significant need for additional liquidity.\nCAC's expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including income tax obligations, are paid by CGP LLC on behalf of CAC pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CGP LLC. These transactions are accounted for as distributions from CGP LLC to CAC.\nCAC has not incurred, nor is it expected to incur, material capital expenditures in the normal course of business or to pursue acquisition opportunities other than through CGP LLC. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nPursuant to the certificate of incorporation of CAC and the CGP Operating Agreement, after October 21, 2016, Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to any transferee of all non-voting units of CGP LLC held by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, to acquire all or a portion of the voting units of\nCGP LLC (or, at the election of CAC, shares of CAC's Class A common stock) not otherwise owned by Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries at such time.\nFollowing October 21, 2018 and until April 21, 2022, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") will have the right to cause a liquidation of CGP LLC, including the sale or winding up of CGP LLC, or other monetization of all of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds remaining after satisfaction of all liabilities of CGP LLC to the holders of CGP LLC's units according to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement. On April 21, 2022 (unless otherwise agreed by Caesars Entertainment and CAC), if our Board has not previously exercised its liquidation right, the CGP Operating Agreement provides that CGP LLC shall, and our Board shall cause CGP LLC to effect a liquidation. The conditions upon which the call right may be exercised, the distribution waterfall for net cash and other assets upon a liquidation, and other information related to the potential liquidation are further discussed in Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share to the CAC financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCAC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\nCertain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments will be subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments are based upon the historical experience of both Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n \u2022 the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and \n \u2022 different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.  When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from our estimates.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards such that an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. We analyze our variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability, and financial agreements.\nBecause the equity holders in CGP LLC receive returns disproportionate to their voting interests and substantially all the activities of CGP LLC are related to Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC has been determined to be a variable interest entity. Additionally, while CAC is the sole voting member of CGP LLC, CAC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of CGP LLC, and therefore we do not consolidate CGP LLC into our financial statements.\nWe consolidate into our financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which we have the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no consolidated subsidiaries.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\nCAC's primary asset is its investment in CGP LLC. We review this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of our investment exceeds its estimated fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than our carrying value, and our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, CGP LLC, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience and the experience of Caesars Entertainment with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nStock-based Compensation\nCAC may grant stock-based compensation awards in CAC Class A common stock to certain officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Caesars Acquisition Company 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (\"the PIP Plan\"). The PIP Plan provides for the plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Caesars Acquisition Company (the \"Committee\"). CAC has granted restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and stock options to directors, certain of its officers and employees of CGP LLC subsidiaries. RSUs and stock options granted to directors and employees are equity-classified awards and are measured at their grant date fair value for accounting purposes. RSUs and stock options granted to individual consultants and advisors are measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CAC Financial Statements.\nCAESARS GROWTH PARTNERS, LLC AND PREDECESSOR GROWTH PARTNERS\nOverview\nCGP LLC used a portion of the cash proceeds from its October 21, 2013 sale of voting units to CAC to purchase from Caesars Entertainment (i) the equity interests of PHWLV, which holds the Planet Hollywood; (ii) its equity interest in Maryland Joint Venture, which is the entity that indirectly holds interests in Horseshoe Baltimore in Maryland, and (iii) a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager, which manages Planet Hollywood, and Caesars Baltimore Management Company LLC, which manages Horseshoe Baltimore. We refer to these transactions as the \"Purchase Transaction\" and the acquired net assets as the \"Purchased Assets.\" The Purchase Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Purchase Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Purchased Assets.\nAlso on October 21, 2013, Caesars Entertainment contributed to CGP LLC, in exchange for non-voting units, (i) Caesars Entertainment's equity interests in CIE, representing approximately 90.2% of the total issued and outstanding shares of CIE prior to giving effect to any options or warrants that were exercisable at that time and (ii) approximately $1.1 billion face value of aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by CEOC. CGP LLC refers to these transactions as the \"Contribution\nTransaction\" and these assets as the \"Contributed Assets.\" The Contribution Transaction is deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. Therefore, CGP LLC has accounted for the Contribution Transaction using the historical carrying values of the Contributed Assets. CGP LLC's equity interests in CIE of 90.2% was reduced in November 2014 to 83.3% due to the conversion of the $47.7 million convertible promissory note issued by CIE to Rock Gaming LLC (\"Rock\"), in each case not giving effect to any options, warrants, restricted stock units and restricted stock.\nIn connection with the Purchase Transaction and the Contribution Transaction, CGP LLC entered into agreements with Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries to provide certain corporate shared services and back-office support and business advisory services to CAC and CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. We refer to the Purchase Transaction, Contribution Transaction and the entering into such agreements collectively as the \"Transactions.\" In addition, CGP LLC reimbursed Caesars Entertainment and CAC for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, and will use the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of voting units to CAC for general corporate purposes, including making strategic investments.\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a pre-determined threshold amount in 2015. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the aggregate fair market value of the subscription rights issued by Caesars Entertainment in the amount of approximately $21.1 million was restored to Caesars Entertainment through a return of all 10.75% paid-in kind senior notes and certain 5.75% senior notes previously issued by CEOC from CGP LLC to CEC.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC contributed the equity interests of PHWLV and a 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager to CGPH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CGP LLC. Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc., which is a majority-owned subsidiary of CEC. On May 5, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Bally's Las Vegas, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under property management agreements entered into between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the CGPH subsidiary which owns each of these respective properties, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties.\nOn May 20, 2014, CGPH through one or more subsidiaries acquired (i) Harrah's New Orleans, (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the Louisiana property management agreement entered between an affiliate of CEOC acting as property manager and the owners of Harrah's New Orleans and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to Harrah's New Orleans.\nCGPH paid $2.0 billion, less outstanding debt assumed, for the May 2014 transactions above.\nThe acquisitions of Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and The Cromwell and the contribution of Planet Hollywood to CGPH are herein referred to as the \"Acquired Properties.\"\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nIn May 2013, CIE acquired the World Series of Poker social and mobile game assets and intellectual property from Electronic Arts, Inc. In August 2013, CIE acquired an online game development business based in the Ukraine and in October 2013, CIE acquired the workforce, assets and intellectual property of an online gaming development group. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these transactions were not material to the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners or CGP LLC.\nIn February 2014, CIE acquired substantially all of the assets of Pacific Interactive, creator and owner of the application House of Fun Slots. CIE recorded $30.5 million in contingent consideration as part of the purchase price allocation related to this acquisition. In March 2015, CIE paid $62.5 million to settle the contingent obligation.\nPresentation\nThe financial information for the periods presented reflect the financial statements of CGP LLC on a combined and consolidated basis, giving regard to all impacts of the October 21, 2013 and May 2014 transactions. The financial information up through October 21, 2013 does not reflect the impacts of those transactions, including the recording of non-controlling interest or the determination of taxes in accordance with the LLC structure of CGP LLC. Instead, this financial information, referred to herein as Predecessor Growth Partners, presents the combination of those assets and entities that were purchased by or\ncontributed to CGP LLC as derived from the historical accounting records and consolidated financial statements of Caesars Entertainment.\nAs a result of the May 2014 transactions described above, one or more indirect subsidiaries of CGP LLC acquired Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Harrah's New Orleans from CEOC. Because these acquisitions were accounted for as transactions among entities under common control, the financial information herein has been recast to include the financial results for these properties as if those businesses were combined into the CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners reporting entities for all periods presented. Therefore, the financial information contained herein provides comparable operating results for all periods presented.\nFor financial reporting purposes, CGP LLC has two operating units: (1) Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. and (2) Casino Properties and Developments. CGP LLC's Interactive Entertainment operating unit consists of CIE, which is comprised of three distinct but complementary businesses: social and mobile games, World Series of Poker and regulated online real money gaming. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments operating unit consists of Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Harrah's New Orleans, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell and CGP LLC's interest in the Maryland Joint Venture.\nPerformance Metrics - Social and Mobile Games\nFor 2015, 2014 and 2013, the CIE business generated 94.6%, 93.6% and 95.6%, respectively, of its revenues from its social and mobile games business. CIE measures the performance of its social and mobile games business by using key financial metrics including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and key operating metrics including Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users, Monthly Unique Users, Average Revenue per User, and Monthly Unique Payers. The following operating metrics help CIE to understand and measure the engagement levels of its players, the size of its audience and its reach.\nDaily Active Users. CIE defines Daily Active Users (\"DAU\") as the number of individuals who played one of its games during a particular day on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games on the same day is counted as two DAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks on the same day would be counted as two DAU. Average DAU for a particular period is the average of the DAU for each day during that period. CIE uses DAU as a measure of audience engagement.\nMonthly Active Users. CIE defines Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\") as the number of individuals who played a particular game in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date on a particular platform. Under this metric, an individual who plays two different games in the same 30-day period is counted as two MAU. Similarly, an individual who plays the same game on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) or on two different social networks in a 30-day period would be counted as two MAU. Average MAU for a particular period is the average of the MAU at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MAU as a measure of total game audience size.\nMonthly Unique Users. CIE defines Monthly Unique Users (\"MUU\") as the number of unique individuals who played any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who plays more than one of CIE's games in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUU. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing across multiple platforms, an individual who plays any of its games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUU in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the player. Because many of CIE's players play more than one game in a given 30-day period, MUU are always lower than MAU in any given time period. Average MUU for a particular period is the average of the MUU at each month-end during that period. CIE tracks MUU as a measure of total audience reach across its network of games.\nMonthly Unique Payers. CIE defines Monthly Unique Payers (\"MUP\") as the number of unique individuals who purchased virtual currency in any of its games on a particular platform in the 30-day period ending with the measurement date. An individual who makes multiple purchases of virtual currency on more than one of CIE's games on a particular platform in a given 30-day period would be counted as a single MUP. However, because CIE cannot always distinguish unique individuals purchasing virtual currency across multiple platforms, an individual who makes a purchase of virtual currency on any of CIE's games on two different platforms (e.g., web and mobile) in a given 30-day period may be counted as two MUP in the event that CIE does not have data that allows it to identify and separate the paying user. Average MUP for a particular period is the average of the MUP at each month-end during that period. CIE uses MUP as a measure of monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nAverage Revenue per User. CIE defines Average Revenue per User (\"ARPU\") as (i) the total revenue in a given period, (ii) divided by the number of days in that period, (iii) divided by the average DAU during the period. CIE believes that ARPU provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its results in the same manner as the Company's management and Board of Directors. CIE uses ARPU as a measure of overall monetization across all of its players through the sale of virtual goods.\nThe table below shows the results of CIE's social and mobile games business, using the operating metrics described above, for the periods indicated. User statistics are presented in thousands of users and ARPU is presented in dollars.\n\n_________________________\n (1) Metrics for 2013 present the aggregate of Predecessor Growth Partners for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, and for CGP LLC for the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 in order for the 2013 metrics to be comparable to 2015 and 2014. \n (2) CIE systems cannot always distinguish unique individuals playing games in multiple sessions in the same day or in a 30-day period ending with the measurement date, playing the same game across multiple platforms, or playing different titles offered by CIE. Thus, users who play multiple titles on multiple platforms may be counted as more than one user within the respective operating metrics.  Consistent with the social and mobile games business model, only a small portion of CIE's social and mobile games players pay for virtual goods. During 2015, CIE had approximately 819 thousand average MUP, or 4.5% of the total number of average MUU on the social and mobile platforms during this period, who purchased virtual goods. The opportunity for social interactions and player generated promotion increases as the overall number of players increase. As such, CIE believes that maintaining and growing its total number of players, irrespective of whether they purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of its business. The sale of virtual goods, however, constitutes the primary source of revenue for CIE's social and mobile games business. The degree to which game players choose to pay for virtual goods in the games is driven by CIE's ability to create content that enhances the game-play experience. CIE's revenue and overall financial performance are affected by the number of players and the effectiveness of its monetization of players through the sale of virtual goods.\nCIE's user metrics are impacted by several factors that cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Growth in the performance metrics is largely attributable to strong organic growth from CIE's games on both mobile and social platforms. Future growth in audience and engagement will depend on CIE's ability to retain current players, attract new players and expand into new markets and distribution platforms.\nThe tables below show the results of CIE's business based upon the financial metrics for the periods presented.\n\nThe table below shows the revenue generated from CIE's social and mobile games business by geographic region for the periods listed and assumes that deferred revenues are spread proportionately across all geographies. \nConsolidated Operating Results of CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners\n\n_________________________\n (1) See Reconciliations of Adjusted Earnings before Interest Income/Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations.  Net revenues for 2015 were $2,345.5 million as compared to $1,867.6 million in 2014, which was an improvement of $477.9 million, or 25.6%. The increase in revenues for CIE was primarily driven by strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games, as well as the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive. The increase in revenues for Casino Properties and Developments was primarily a result of the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino which was substantially completed and available to guests in early May 2015, and was partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans as a result of the April 2015 smoking ban.\nIncome from operations for 2015 was $483.0 million as compared to a loss of $108.0 million in 2014, which was an improvement of $591.0 million. The improvement in income from operations was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units in 2015, the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of the Horseshoe Baltimore. Excluding the impact of the change in fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units and the change in fair value of contingent consideration from both periods as well as the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas, income from operations for 2015 improved by $254.9 million primarily due to the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million for 2014, related to one of CIE's development studios in Minsk, Belarus which was disposed of in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2015 and 2014 was $632.3 million and $416.2 million, respectively. The increase of $216.1 million, or 51.9%, from prior year was driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nNet revenues for 2014 increased by $512.2 million, or 37.8%, compared with 2013, driven by strong performance in both operating units, including CIE's February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive and the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014.\nLoss from operations for 2014 was $108.0 million as compared with $23.3 million for 2013. The increase in loss from operations was primarily attributable to an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units to be issued to Caesars Entertainment pursuant to the terms of the Transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $77.1 million, or 22.7%, in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven primarily by the income impact of increased revenues.\nOperating Results\nInteractive Entertainment\n\n_________________________\n (1) See Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations.  Interactive Entertainment net revenues increased by $179.7 million, or 30.6%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting primarily from strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games, as well as the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive. Income from operations increased by $168.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues, expense related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration recognized in the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by increased advertising expenses. Net loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million in 2014 due to CIE's suspension of operations of the Minsk development studio. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $105.7 million, or 59.7%, in 2015 as compared to 2014, driven by the income impact of increased revenues and reduced marketing expenses for online real money gaming.\nInteractive Entertainment net revenues increased by $270.2 million, or 85.3%, in 2014 as compared to 2013, as a result of the February 2014 acquisition of Pacific Interactive, organic growth in the social and mobile games business and the full-year impact of online real money gaming in Nevada and New Jersey. Income from operations for 2014 was $21.3 million as compared with a loss in operations of $7.0 million for the comparable period in 2013. Net loss from discontinued operations was $15.6 million in 2014 as compared to $0.4 million in 2013 due to CIE's suspension of operations of the Minsk development studio. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $79.5 million, or 81.5%, in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven by the income impact of increased revenues, partially offset by increased marketing expenses associated with online real money gaming, operating expenses due to the business growth of social and mobile games and foreign currency transaction losses of $5.4 million.\nCasino Properties and Developments \n_________________________\n (1) See Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations.  Performance of the Casino Properties and Developments operating unit is measured in part through tracking of trips by rated customers, which means a customer whose gaming activity is tracked through Caesars Entertainment's Total Rewards system, referred to as \"trips,\" and spend per rated customer trip, referred to as \"spend per trip.\" A trip is created by a Total\nRewards card holder engaging in one or more of the following activities while at our property: (1) hotel stay, (2) gaming activity or (3) a comp redemption, which means the receipt of a complimentary item given out by the casino. Lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program who stay at our property and non-lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program not staying at the property. Customer spend means the cumulative rated theoretical spend (which is the amount of money expected to be retained by the casino based upon the mathematics underlying the particular game as a fraction of the amount of money wagered by the customer) across all game types for a specific customer. The average combined gross hold is the percentage of the amount wagered across all game types (including table games and slot machines) that the casino retained.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2015 increased by $298.2 million, or 23.3%, when compared to 2014, primarily due to the openings of The Cromwell in May 2014 and Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014, and by increased rates and the availability of rooms as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, partially offset by lower revenues at Harrah's New Orleans due to the April 2015 smoking ban. Total trips increased approximately 25.8% in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily driven by the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nCasino revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $1,009.6 million and $799.9 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore and completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Gross casino hold also saw a positive variance, increasing from 11.2% in 2014 to 11.9% in 2015.\nRoom revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $323.2 million and $258.4 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenues was primarily due to the availability of rooms and increased rates as a result of the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, higher demand in the Las Vegas market and the increase in resort fees in late 2014. Cash average daily room rates for 2015 increased to approximately $123, or 13.9%, when compared to approximately $108 for the same period in 2014. Average daily occupancy was 92.4% and 89.7% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue per available room (\"RevPar\") for 2015 and 2014 was $112 and $98, respectively, or an increase of 14.3%.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $275.0 million and $245.5 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by the completion of renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino in 2015 and new offerings that opened in 2014 across the portfolio including various new venues at The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore.\nOther revenues for 2015 and 2014 were $162.9 million and $156.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore as well as increases in entertainment and retail revenue at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nIncome from operations was $193.2 million for 2015 as compared to loss from operations of $74.5 million in 2014. The improvement was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the income impact of increased revenues, offset by increased expenses resulting from the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 increased by $112.1 million, or 44.1%, when compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by increased revenues, partially offset by operating expenses incurred after the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by favorable casino hold of $12.6 million year over year.\nCasino Properties and Developments net revenues for 2014 increased by $242.0 million, or 23.3%, when compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to the opening of The Cromwell in May 2014 and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore in August 2014. For 2014, total rated trips increased by approximately 31.8% from 2013, driven by a 37.8% increase for non-lodgers, partially offset by a 4.7% decrease for lodgers. While spend per trip for lodgers and non-lodgers increased respectively, the shift to non-lodgers who typically spend less caused combined spend per trip to decline approximately 4.9%.\nCasino revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $799.9 million and $663.5 million, respectively. The increase in Casino revenues was primarily due to the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell in 2014. Gross casino hold decreased from 11.5% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2014.\nRoom revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $258.4 million and $241.0 million, respectively. The increase in Room revenue was primarily due to the introduction of resort fees and renovated rooms at Bally's Las Vegas and The LINQ Hotel & Casino. Cash average daily room rates for 2014 increased to $108, or approximately 25.6%, when compared to approximately $86 in 2013. Average daily occupancy was 89.7% in 2014 and 89.5% in 2013. RevPar for 2014 and 2013 was $98 and $82, respectively, or an increase of 19.5%. The revenue impact of favorable trends in room metrics was mostly offset by a lower number of rooms available due to room renovations at The LINQ Hotel & Casino.\nFood and beverage revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $245.5 million and $200.6 million, respectively. The increase in Food and beverage revenues was driven largely by new offerings that opened in 2014 such as various new venues at Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell.\nOther revenues for 2014 and 2013 were $156.6 million and $94.0 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the opening of Drai's at The Cromwell and enhanced entertainment options at the new Axis Theater at Planet Hollywood.\nLoss from operations was $74.5 million for 2014 as compared to income from operations of $139.1 million in 2013. Income impact of increased revenues was more than offset by the combination of an impairment of goodwill for Bally's Las Vegas of $147.5 million, increased expenses at The LINQ Hotel & Casino primarily due to its strip-front lease, and increased pre-opening expenses associated with Horseshoe Baltimore. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $10.7 million, or 4.4%, for 2014 when compared with 2013 primarily driven by the income impact of increased revenues.\nIncentives are often provided for customers to stay and play at our properties. Incentives are provided to customers based on a number of factors such as marketing plans, competitive factors, economic conditions, and regulations. These incentives come in a variety of different forms including free and discounted products, gaming credits, food and beverage credits, hotel room credits, and other forms. The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to casino guests is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. Hence, net revenues as discussed above include all promotional allowances. CGP LLC believes its allocation of promotional allowances to be within industry standards and appropriate for its brands and competitive environment.\nOther Factors Affecting Net Income\n\n_________________________\n (1) The provision for income taxes for CGP LLC for 2015 and 2014, and for the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE, which is taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes. CGP LLC's provision for income taxes also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. No provision for income taxes is reported for properties within the Casino Properties and Developments operating unit of CGP LLC that were acquired in 2013 as such properties are taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes whereby any income or losses were allocated to the CGP LLC members and taxed by each member. Predecessor Growth Partners' income taxes represent the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns, and does not recognize the pass-through entity structure of CGP LLC. \n (2) CGP LLC's non-controlling interest reflects the non-controlling interest associated with consolidating CIE and the Maryland Joint Venture into CGP LLC. As the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners were prepared on a combined basis rather than a consolidated basis, the non-controlling interest associated with CIE is not included within the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners.  Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized\nThe table below summarizes CGP LLC's interest expenses, net of interest capitalized: \nInterest Income - Related Party\nCGP LLC recognized interest income on the CEOC Notes through the third quarter of 2014. The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. During the third quarter of 2014, CGP LLC sold a portion of the notes to CEOC and distributed the remaining notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC.\nImpairment of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to release losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nGain on Sale of Investment in Notes from Related Party\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the Note Purchase Agreement and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Planet Hollywood secured loan contained excess cash flow provisions which required mandatory prepayments when certain conditions were met. Prepayments in excess of the recorded book value of principal owed were recorded in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations of CGP LLC and Combined Statements of Operations for Predecessor Growth Partners. Inclusive of the impact of the loan payoff in conjunction with the Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement as defined in Intercreditor Agreement and Collateral Agreements section of Note 7- Debt to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $23.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. There was no Loss on extinguishment of debt recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Other income, net was $3.9 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in Other income, net for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to CIE's gain recognized on a contract termination.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nCGP LLC\nThe provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its subsidiary, CIE, which is taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes. CGP LLC's provision for income taxes also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. The provision for income taxes for CGP LLC differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35.0% primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level.\nThe effective tax rates for December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 21.3% and (32.9)%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is primarily due to CGP LLC income not taxed at the CGP LLC entity level in 2015 versus CGP LLC losses not tax benefitted at the CGP LLC entity level in 2014.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nThe provision for income taxes represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. The provision for income taxes for the periods presented differs from the expected federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign operations partially offset by nondeductible stock-based compensation and nondeductible expenses, including lobbying expenditures and professional fees. The effective tax rate for the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013 was 35.8%.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax\nIn June 2014, CIE concluded that, effective August 2014, it would suspend operations of its Minsk development studio. As a result, CIE recorded an impairment of $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. In the third quarter of 2014, CIE settled its accrued contingent consideration liability for $4.5 million and recognized a gain of $1.4 million on the final disposition of the entity. CGP LLC has presented the operations of the Minsk development studio as discontinued operations in CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Loss/(Income) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nCGP LLC\nCGP LLC's non- controlling interest reflects the non-controlling interest associated with consolidating CIE and the Maryland Joint Venture into CGP LLC. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Caesars Interactive for 2015 was $20.2 million. For 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, net loss of $4.5 million and $0.9 million\nwas attributable to non-controlling interests in CIE for the respective period. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the Maryland Joint Venture was $13.1 million, $28.5 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, respectively.\nPredecessor Growth Partners\nAs the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners were prepared on a combined basis rather than a consolidated basis, the non-controlling interest associated with CIE is not included within the financial statements of Predecessor Growth Partners. For the period from January 1 through October 21, 2013, net loss attributed to non-controlling interests related to losses in the Maryland Joint Venture and CIE was $5.1 million and zero, respectively.\nReconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its financial performance. EBITDA is comprised of net income before (i) interest expense, net of capitalized interest, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, further adjusted for certain items that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners do not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance.\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure below. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information that allows for an understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of capital investment decisions made for the long-term benefit of CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________\n (1) Includes investment in CEOC bonds through the third quarter of 2014, the CGP parent company and intercompany eliminations. \n (2) Amounts represent the difference between the fair value of consideration paid and the book value, net of deferred financing costs, of debt retired through debt extinguishment transactions, which are capital structure related, rather than operational type costs. \n (3) Amounts primarily represent development costs related to the construction of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore, and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. \n (4) Amounts represent the change in fair value of contingently issuable non-voting membership units associated with the CIE earn-out calculation related to the transactions establishing CGP LLC. The total amount represents the estimated fair value of CGP LLC non-voting membership units to be issued to a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment. \n (5) Amounts represent the change in fair value of contingent consideration for CIE acquisitions. \n (6) Amounts represent stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. \n (7) Amounts represent other add-backs and deductions to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA but not separately identified, such as lobbying expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Spending\nCGP LLC incurs capital expenditures in the normal course of business, performs ongoing refurbishment and maintenance at its existing casino entertainment facilities, and periodically expands and enhances the information technology infrastructure required to operate its social and mobile games in order to maintain their quality standards. Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available from cash flows generated by operating activities while cash used for development projects is typically funded from specific project financing and additional debt offerings. CGP LLC may also pursue acquisition opportunities for additional businesses or social or mobile games that meet its strategic and return on investment criteria.\nCGP LLC's capital spending and maintenance, if they go forward, could require significant capital commitments and, if completed, may result in significant additional revenues. The commitment of capital, the timing of completion, and the commencement of operations of development projects are contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of final agreements and receipt of requisite approvals from the applicable political and regulatory bodies. Excluding amounts spent for the purchases of businesses, CGP LLC's cash used for capital spending for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013 was $174.5 million, $568.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively. Predecessor Growth Partners' cash used for capital spending for the period from January 1, 2013 through October 21, 2013 totaled $156.6 million.\nThe majority of the 2015 capital spending related to the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. The LINQ Hotel & Casino began opening a portion of the Phase II renovations in March 2015 and it was substantially completed in early May 2015. The majority of the 2014 and 2013 capital spending related to The Cromwell which was completed and reopened in the second quarter of 2014, Horseshoe Baltimore which opened in August 2014, and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The LINQ Hotel & Casino were $112.0 million, $111.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures net of related payables for The Cromwell were $139.0 million and $58.6 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, capital expenditures net of related payables for Horseshoe Baltimore was $258.6 million.\nLiquidity\nCGP LLC and its subsidiaries' primary sources of liquidity include currently available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from its operations and borrowings under the $150.0 million CGPH revolving credit agreement (\"CGPH Revolving Credit Facility\") which is intended to satisfy CGPH's short-term liquidity needs. CGP LLC's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $901.7 million and $944.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of total cash and cash equivalents, Caesars Interactive had $99.1 million and $92.1 million in foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Caesars Interactive may use the cash in its subsidiaries outside the U.S. to repay debt payable to related parties, fund operations at these subsidiaries, pursue international acquisitions, or repatriate the cash to the United States.\nPayments of short-term debt obligations and other commitments are expected to be made from operating cash flows. Long-term obligations are expected to be paid through operating cash flows, refinancing of existing debt or the issuance of new debt, or, if necessary, additional investments from its equity holders. CGP LLC's operating cash inflows are used for operating expenses, debt service costs, repurchase of equity from CIE's management shareholders, working capital needs and capital expenditures in the normal course of business. CGP LLC's ability to refinance debt will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, CGP LLC's financial performance, and the limitations applicable to such transactions under CGP LLC's and its subsidiaries' financing documents. Additionally, CGP LLC's ability to fund operations, pay debt obligations, and fund planned capital expenditures depends, in part, upon economic and other factors that are beyond CGP LLC's control, and disruptions in capital markets and restrictive covenants related to CGP LLC's existing debt could impact CGP LLC's ability to fund liquidity needs, pay indebtedness and secure additional funds through financing activities.\nCGP LLC's restricted cash totaled $12.5 million and $40.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include amounts restricted under the terms of the Baltimore Credit Facility and the Cromwell Credit Facility, as defined below. The classification of restricted cash between current and long-term is dependent upon the intended use of each particular reserve.\nIssuers issued $675.0 million aggregate principal amount of their 9.375% second-priority senior secured notes due 2022 pursuant to an indenture dated as of April 17, 2014, among the Issuers and US Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Indenture\"). On May 8, 2014, CGPH closed on $1.175 billion of term loans pursuant to a credit agreement. CGPH filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (the \"Registration Statement\") on March 30, 2015 and amendments to such Registration Statement on May 18, 2015 and May 29, 2015 to initiate an offer to exchange the 2022 Notes and certain related guarantees in a private offering for a like aggregate amount of CGPH's registered 9.375% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and certain related guarantees (collectively refer to as the \"Exchange Notes\"). The Registration Statement was declared effective on June 26, 2015 (the \"Effective Date\"). The exchange offer was consummated on July 28, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, CGPH had $1,125.7 million, $660.3 million and $45.0 million in book value of indebtedness outstanding for the CGPH Term Loan, 2022 Notes and Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the book value of indebtedness outstanding for the CGPH Term Loan and 2022 Notes was $1,132.5 million and $658.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the assets of Harrah's New Orleans, Bally's Las Vegas, Planet Hollywood and The LINQ Hotel & Casino were pledged as collateral for certain of CGPH's outstanding debt securities.\nIn November 2012, Corner Investment Propco, LLC (\"PropCo\") entered into a $185.0 million, seven-year senior secured credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus 9.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.25% (the \"Cromwell Credit Facility\") to fund the renovation of The Cromwell into a boutique lifestyle hotel. As of December 31, 2015, the assets of The Cromwell were pledged as collateral for the Cromwell Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, CIE had $39.8 million of book value of indebtedness outstanding and payable to Caesars Entertainment which was repaid in its entirety during the year ended December 31, 2015. Horseshoe Baltimore had $318.8 million and $319.2 million for the respective periods, and The Cromwell had $169.2 million and $178.0 million, respectively, of book value of indebtedness outstanding and payable to third-party lenders for the same periods.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CGP LLC had $2,402.3 million and $2,386.2 million, respectively, face value of indebtedness outstanding, including capital lease indebtedness. Cash paid for interest for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $190.9 million, $117.4 million, and $45.3 million, respectively.\nCGP LLC believes that its cash and cash equivalents balance and its cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its normal operating and debt service requirements during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and to fund capital expenditures expected to be incurred in the normal course of business.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table presents CGP LLC's outstanding third-party debt as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n________________________________\n(1) Variable interest rate calculated as LIBOR plus 5.25%\nCGP LLC has early adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and reclassified $14.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs from Deferred charges and other assets to a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability in Long-term debt in CGP LLC's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014. See Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants related to debt instruments.\nDuring the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, Propco failed to meet the covenant of achieving consolidated EBITDA of at least $7.5 million. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows CGP LLC to cure this covenant by making a cash cure payment. Such payments were made on March 31, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and on May 22, 2015 during the permitted cure period for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The Cromwell Credit Facility allows this right to cure provided that (i) in each eight-fiscal-quarter period there shall be no more than five fiscal quarters in which the cure right is exercised and (ii) the cure right may not be exercised in any fiscal quarter that immediately follows two consecutive fiscal quarters in which it was exercised.\nThe CGPH Term Loan also provides for a $150.0 million revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). As of December 31, 2015, $45.0 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $0.1 million was committed to outstanding letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has a contractual maturity of greater than one year and CGPH has the ability to repay the outstanding principal balances beyond the next 12 months. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility are intended to satisfy short-term liquidity needs and are classified in Current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On January 21, 2016, CGPH drew an additional $15.0 million of borrowings on its $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Horseshoe Baltimore Credit Facility also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit agreement with a five-year maturity that remained undrawn at December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 7 - Debt of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for further details.\nCIE Credit Facility\nCaesars Interactive entered into a credit facility whereby Caesars Entertainment provided to Caesars Interactive unsecured intercompany loans as requested by CIE and approved by Caesars Entertainment on an individual transaction basis. No principal payments were required on the unsecured intercompany loans until their maturity date of November 29, 2016. The unsecured intercompany loans bore interest on the unpaid principal amounts at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5%. This credit facility did not have any restrictive or affirmative covenants. The outstanding balance on the credit facility was\n$39.8 million as of December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repaid in full the $39.8 million outstanding balance.\nRock Promissory Notes\nIn March 2012, Rock and CIE entered into an agreement pursuant to which Rock purchased approximately 6,155 shares of CIE common stock for $30.4 million in cash and agreed to purchase additional shares of CIE common stock on or before July 2, 2012. CIE used the proceeds from this sale to prepay a portion of the then outstanding balance on the credit facility. In June 2012, CIE and Rock modified the agreement with Rock such that CIE issued to Rock approximately 382 shares of CIE common stock and a promissory note for $28.5 million in exchange for $30.4 million in cash. The promissory note was convertible into approximately 5,773 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. In November 2012, CIE issued to Rock an additional promissory note for $19.2 million in exchange for $19.2 million in cash. The additional promissory note was convertible into approximately 3,140 shares of CIE common stock, upon the satisfaction of certain criteria. Both promissory notes automatically converted into 8,913 shares of CIE common stock in November 2014.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. Upon the October 21, 2013 closing of the Transactions, CGP LLC recorded a liability of $167.8 million representing the estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units. The estimated fair value of the contingently issuable non-voting membership units was adjusted to $228.0 million and $345.2 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The change in fair value was a decrease of $117.2 million for 2015 and an increase of $38.7 million for 2014, respectively, which was reported within the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nAt December 31, 2013, CGP LLC owned $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of the CEOC Notes.\nOn May 5, 2014 CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% face value aggregate principal amount of notes previously issued by CEOC as a dividend to its members, pro rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. CAC, as a member of CGP LLC and the holder of 42.4% of the economic interests in CGP LLC at the time of the Notes Distribution, received in connection with the Notes Distribution $137.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes and $151.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes.\nOther Obligations and Commitments\nThe table below summarizes CGP LLC's contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2015. \n_________________________\n (1) Estimated interest for variable rate debt included in this table is based on rates at December 31, 2015. \n (2) Entertainment obligations represent obligations to pay performers that have contracts for future performances. This amount does not include estimated obligations for future performances where payment is only guaranteed when the performances occur and/or is based on factors contingent upon the profitability of the performances.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCGP LLC did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2015 or 2014.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners prepare their financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Certain accounting policies, including the estimated consumption rate of virtual goods that is used for revenue recognition in the social and mobile games business, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets, income taxes, accounting for stock-based compensation, the valuation of contingent consideration, the valuation of contingently issuable non-voting membership units, and the evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, require that CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a summary of CGP LLC's and Predecessor Growth Partners' significant accounting policies, please refer to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the CGP LLC consolidated financial statements and Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Predecessor Growth Partners combined financial statements.\nCGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n \u2022 the estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and \n \u2022 different estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position or results of operations.  When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners select the principle or method that they consider to be the most appropriate when given the specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires them to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates, actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates. In preparing these financial statements, CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners have made their best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nCGP LLC consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC analyzes its variable interests to determine if the entity that is party to the variable interest is a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. This analysis requires significant judgment on the part of management, and any changes to that judgment could result in reaching a different consolidation conclusion. CGP LLC's analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. Quantitative analysis is based on the forecasted cash flows of the entity. Qualitative analysis is based on CGP LLC's review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. Based on current analysis, Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC, has an ownership interest in CR Baltimore Holdings (\"CRBH\"), a variable interest entity. Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of CRBH and therefore consolidates CRBH into its financial statements. As Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC is wholly-owned by CGP LLC, CGP LLC therefore also consolidates the CRBH variable interest.\nCGP LLC also consolidates into its financial statements the accounts of any wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that are not deemed to be variable interest entities and for which CGP LLC has the ability to control. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby investments that are more than 50% owned are consolidated, investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method, and investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for using the cost method.\nCGP LLC's consolidated financial statements include the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\nUp through and including October 21, 2013, Predecessor Growth Partners combined into its financial statements the accounts of any variable interest entity for which it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Predecessor Growth Partners analyzed its variable interests to determine if the entity that was party to the variable interest was a variable interest entity in accordance with GAAP. Based on the analyses, Predecessor Growth Partners was the primary beneficiary, and therefore had included the Horseshoe Baltimore development project in Maryland, a variable interest entity, in its combined financial statements.\nPredecessor Growth Partners' combined financial statements include the accounts of Predecessor Growth Partners and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. These combined financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially-owned subsidiaries that Predecessor Growth Partners had the ability to control.\nApplication of Acquisition Method Accounting\nIn December 2012, CIE consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Buffalo Studios, a social and mobile games developer based in Santa Monica, California. Aggregate cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $45.2 million, excluding amounts paid out in 2014 resulting from contingent consideration. In April 2014, CIE paid $58.5 million to the former owners of Buffalo Studios to settle the contingent obligation.\nOn February 13, 2014, CIE acquired 100% of the voting and economic interest in Pacific Interactive, a company based in the United Kingdom. Aggregate consideration was $51.8 million, including CIE's preliminary estimate of $30.5 million in contingent consideration. Pacific Interactive is the operator of House of Fun Slots, which is among the leading social and mobile casino-themed games on Facebook, iOS, and Android platforms. Similar to CIE's legacy games, Pacific Interactive offers its games under a \"free-to-play\" model in which users can download and play the game for free, but are charged for additional game coins and other virtual consumable goods.\nCIE applied the acquisition method of accounting to these business combinations, which required the company to identify the acquiring entity, determine the appropriate acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, and recognize and measure goodwill.\nThe application of the acquisition method accounting guidance had the following effects on its consolidated financial statements: (i) CIE measured the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with promulgated valuation recognition and measurement provisions and recognized such in CGP LLC's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014; (ii) CIE reported the operating results of Buffalo Studios in Predecessor Growth Partners' combined statements of operations and cash flows for the period ended October 21, 2013 as well as in CGP LLC's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to October 21, 2013; and (iii) CIE reported the operating results of Pacific Interactive subsequent to its acquisition date.\nCIE engaged independent third-party valuation expertise to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as the established user base, the game engine and the developed games, and in the fair value determination of any other significant tangible assets or liabilities, such as long-lived property. Enterprise value allocation methodology requires that management make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. If actual amounts significantly differ from the estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, the resulting difference can materially affect the fair value of net assets.\nCIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Buffalo Studios' assets of approximately $52.9 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $2.1 million, excluding contingent consideration. CIE recorded acquisition date fair values of Pacific Interactive's assets of approximately $64.2 million, and fair value of liabilities assumed of approximately $12.4 million, excluding contingent consideration.\nInvestment in CES\nInvestment in CES consists of membership interests in CES which is a variable interest entity of which CGP LLC owns less than 20% and is not the primary beneficiary. CGP LLC does not exercise significant influence over the variable interest entity and therefore accounts for the investment using the cost method (see Note 19 - Related Party Transactions to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1). CGP LLC reviews this investment quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, CGP LLC considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of this investment. If the carrying value of CGP LLC's investment exceeds its estimated fair value, CGP LLC evaluates, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the estimated fair value is less than CGP LLC's carrying value, and CGP LLC's intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. CGP LLC also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new carrying basis in the investment will be established. CGP LLC did not recognize an impairment charge in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 on this investment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCGP LLC has significant capital invested in its long-lived assets and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in the financial results and whether CGP LLC has a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. CGP LLC assigns lives to its assets based on its standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. CGP LLC reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management\nin performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the asset group level, which, for most of CGP LLC's assets, is the individual property.\nGoodwill and Other Non-Amortizing Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. CGP LLC and Predecessor Growth Partners determined the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. CGP LLC also evaluates, and Predecessor Growth Partners also evaluated, the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in CGP LLC's industry.\nPredecessor Growth Partners performed an annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of September 30 or more frequently if impairment indicators existed. CGP LLC performs its annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of October 1 or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. CGP LLC determines, and Predecessor Growth Partners determined, the estimated fair value of non-amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the \"Relief from Royalty Method\" and \"Excess Earnings Method\" under the income approach.\nThe annual evaluation of goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results, valuation multiples, and discount rates to determine their fair value. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect these estimates. Thus, to the extent the gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or CGP LLC does not meet its projected performance, CGP LLC could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill and other non-amortizing intangible assets have been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, CGP LLC had approximately $302.5 million in total book value of goodwill and $260.7 million of other non-amortizing intangible assets that are at risk of further partial or total impairment should CGP LLC experience minor adverse changes in our significant assumptions in the future. Of this amount, $237.0 million is allocated to Planet Hollywood, Harrah's New Orleans and CIE reporting units. These reporting units have estimated fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values and therefore, are not at risk of partial or total impairment outside of drastic, unforeseen circumstances. Specifically, Planet Hollywood's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 189.1%, Harrah's New Orleans' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 34.7%, and CIE's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 951.0%. $65.5 million of goodwill is allocated to our Bally's Las Vegas reporting unit, at which we recorded impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, Bally's Las Vegas' estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by a margin of 13.8%. Thus, to the extent gaming volumes deteriorate further in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we could have impairments to record in the next twelve months, and such impairments could be material. This is especially true for any of our properties where goodwill has been partially impaired as a result of a recent impairment analysis. Impairment charges related to goodwill or intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized in impairment of goodwill or impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 5 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nInteractive Entertainment-Social and Mobile Games\nCIE derives revenue from the sale of virtual goods within casino-themed social and mobile games which are played on various global social and mobile third-party platforms. CIE's largest application, Slotomania, represented 48.5%, 51.0% and 63.6% of CIE's social and mobile games revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCIE's social and mobile games operate on a free-to-play model, whereby game players may collect virtual currency or other virtual consumable goods (collectively referred to as \"virtual goods\" or \"virtual currency\") free of charge through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players have the ability to send free \"gifts\" of virtual goods to their friends through interactions with certain social platforms. If a game player wishes to obtain virtual goods above\nand beyond the level of free virtual goods available to that player, the player may purchase additional virtual goods. Once a purchase is completed, the virtual goods are deposited into the player's account and are not separately identifiable from previously purchased virtual goods or virtual goods obtained by the game player for free.\nOnce obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play. When virtual currency is played in the games, the game player could \"win\" and would be awarded additional virtual currency, or could \"lose\" and lose the future use of that virtual currency. As the game player does not receive any additional benefit from the games, nor is the game player entitled to any additional rights once the game player's virtual goods are substantially consumed, CIE has concluded that the virtual goods represent consumable goods.\nCIE has determined through a review of customer play behavior that game players who purchase virtual currency generally are not purchasing additional virtual currency if their existing virtual goods balances have not been substantially consumed. As CIE is able to track the duration between purchases of virtual currency for individual game players, CIE is able to reliably estimate the period of time over which virtual currency is consumed. As such, CIE recognizes revenue using an item-based revenue model.\nBecause CIE is unable to distinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency, CIE must estimate the amount of outstanding purchased virtual currency at each reporting period based on customer behavior. Based upon an analysis of the customers' historical play behavior, the timing difference between when virtual currencies are purchased by a customer and when those virtual currencies are consumed in gameplay is relatively short. CIE records within Other current liabilities the deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games, and also records within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, CIE had deferred revenue associated with its social and mobile games of $3.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively, recorded within Other current liabilities on CGP LLC's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. CIE also recorded within Prepayments and other current assets the prepaid platform fees associated with this deferred revenue, aggregating $1.2 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCIE continues to gather detailed customer play behavior and assesses this data in relation to its revenue recognition policy. To the extent the customer play behavior changes, CIE reassesses its estimates and assumptions used for revenue recognition.\nCIE's games are played on various social and mobile third-party platforms for which such third parties collect monies from CIE's customers and pay CIE an amount after deducting a platform fee. CIE is the primary obligor with its customers, and under most of these arrangements, retains the ability to establish the pricing for its virtual currencies and assumes all credit risk with its customers.\nBased upon the above facts, CIE recognizes the majority of its revenues from its game-playing customers on a gross basis and related platform fees are recorded as a component of operating expense.\nPrior to September 2013, transactions conducted through the Facebook platform were facilitated using Facebook credits (\"FB Credits\"), which is a form of virtual currency specific to the Facebook platform. Effectively, transactions priced by CIE to sell a specified number of virtual goods for a specified cost in a game player's local currency had FB Credits inserted into the transaction flow, whereby the purchase price paid by the game player was first converted to FB Credits, and the FB Credits were then converted into the resulting number of virtual goods. This provided a means for Facebook platform users to accumulate FB Credits prior to making an in-application purchase, and for the Facebook platform to provide to its users FB Credits at a discount or for free.\nSubsequent to the September 2013 elimination of FB Credits, Facebook may provide free gift cards or determine other means of discounting virtual currencies purchased by the Facebook platform users. As a result, CIE reviews the individual transaction details to ensure that revenues recognized for the sale of virtual currencies through the Facebook platform represent cash paid for such currencies by CIE's game players.\nTaxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses.\nContingently Issuable Non-voting Membership Units\nPursuant to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement, in conjunction with CGP LLC's acquisition of CIE from Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC is obligated to issue additional non-voting membership units to Caesars Entertainment to the extent that the earnings from a specified portion of CIE's social and mobile games business exceeds a predetermined threshold amount in 2015. This instrument was considered a derivative instrument. Therefore, the balance of this liability was adjusted to reflect the expected number of non-voting units to be issued at the current estimated fair value of those units at each reporting date. Both the estimate of the number of units to be issued and the estimated fair value of non-voting units at the reporting date fall into Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the\nContingently issuable non-voting membership units payable was forecasted earnings. Significant changes in forecasted earnings would have resulted in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. CGP LLC believes that it will issue approximately 31.9 million Class B non-voting units pursuant to the terms of the Transactions, although the final number of units to be issued is subject to the agreement of both CAC and CEC.\nStock-based Compensation\nIn addition to the CAC Equity Plan, Caesars Entertainment grants stock-based compensation awards in Caesars Entertainment common stock to certain employees that work for the management companies of the casino properties under the Caesars 2012 Performance Incentive Plan.\nCIE grants stock-based compensation awards in CIE common stock to its employees and service providers in accordance with the Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. Amended and Restated Management Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is intended to promote the interests of CIE and its shareholders by providing key employees, directors, service providers and consultants with an incentive to encourage their continued employment or service and improve the growth and profitability of CIE. The Plan provides for the Plan to be administered by the Human Resources Committee (\"HRC\") of the Committee. As a matter of policy, the exercise price of all options granted under the Plan has been determined by the Committee to ensure that the exercise price of options granted under the Plan complies with the requirement that such exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying shares at the respective grant dates.\nIn February 2014, the Committee approved a liquidity plan, setting forth the terms and conditions upon which CIE may elect to purchase, or cause to be purchased, CIE owned shares and/or shares underlying options, RSUs, restricted stock or warrants (\"deemed held shares\") held by eligible individuals, from time to time, during the term of the plan, and providing the eligible individuals with a market for their CIE shares and/or deemed held shares (the \"Liquidity Plan\").\nThe following is a description of the components of these programs under the Plan as of December 31, 2015:\nStock Options and Warrants\nTime-based stock options and warrants have been granted to employees and non-employees, and are subject to graded vesting periods ranging from three to seven years. Vesting is subject to the participant's continued employment or service, through the applicable vesting date.\nAll warrants to non-employees and the majority of the stock options to employees and non-employees contain a call option, at a fixed amount, which is exercisable by CIE. Since the embedded call feature is at a fixed price, the call feature could result in a repurchase amount that is less than the fair value of the underlying shares. Therefore, these options and warrants are liability-classified instruments and are measured at fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. Prior to 2014, options without the call provision were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. All unexercised options and warrants expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.\nAs described above, the Committee approved the Liquidity Plan to provide offers to repurchase certain awards and CIE shares from participants of the Plan. For accounting purposes, the provisions of the Liquidity Plan were deemed to modify the awards underlying the Plan. Effectively, the Company has determined to account for the subject stock options and warrants as if CIE has a conditional obligation to settle such options in cash at some future date pursuant to the Liquidity Plan. However, (i) the Liquidity Plan is fully at CIE's discretion, (ii) requires additional approval by the HRC for all future purchases and (iii) makes no commitment that any specific employees will be permitted to participate in future shares or deemed share purchases, if any. As a result of this modification, all outstanding options and warrants granted under the Plan were modified to be accounted for as liability-classified awards at December 31, 2015.\nCertain CIE employees have been granted CIE stock options with vesting conditions achieved upon CIE meeting certain consolidated earnings targets. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost recorded over the estimated service period implied by the particular performance target pertaining to each tranche of awards.\nCertain non-employees have been granted CIE stock options which initially contained vesting conditions associated with the legalization and implementation of online gaming in the U.S. Under the original grant agreements, these stock options were to vest based on conditions other than market, performance or service conditions and therefore were recorded as liability-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at each reporting date for accounting purposes. These stock options were modified during 2015 to remove such vesting conditions and to instead subject the awards to graded three year vesting from the date of modification. These stock options are subject to the call feature described in the preceding paragraph, and are thus classified as liability instruments, with compensation cost to be recognized ratably by CIE over the amended three-year vesting schedule.\nRestricted Shares and RSU's\nCertain key employees of a subsidiary of CIE have been granted restricted shares which became fully vested during 2014 and which were reclassified to equity in 2015.\nCertain key CIE employees have been granted RSUs, which are subject to vesting periods ranging from two to seven years. For RSU awards subject to a seven-year vesting period, 25% of the award vests ratably over four years, 25% vests ratably over 5 years, 25% vests ratably over six years and 25% vests ratably over seven years. The remaining RSUs are subject to either cliff vesting, whereby 100% of the award vests once the service period has been met, or graded vesting, whereby the award vests ratably over the service period.\nFor the period from October 22 through December 31, 2013, restricted shares and RSUs were equity-classified instruments and were measured at their fair value at the date of grant for accounting purposes. Restricted shares and RSUs were subject to the provisions of the Liquidity Plan as described above and were deemed modified in 2014. As a result of this modification, the Company reversed any previously recorded expense in 2014 and any outstanding restricted shares and RSUs were recorded at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. If an RSU is not repurchased within six months and one day of vesting, the award will be reclassified to equity and CIE will no longer record the award at fair value.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $5,221 to $5,446 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $8,000 to $10,710 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, CIE repurchased shares at prices ranging from $12,630 to $15,340 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $54.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring January and February 2016, CIE repurchased shares at a price of $15,740 per share. Aggregate consideration paid by CIE totaled $26.7 million during January and February 2016.\nValuation of CIE Common Stock\nCIE determines the value of its common stock in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the \"Practice Aid\") with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm, and taking into account facts and circumstances specific to each quarter. Given the relative independence of the components of the entity, the valuation specialists, performed sum of the parts valuations which used a combination of market-based and income-based approaches for the various business components to determine the value of each component of the business, and then aggregated these component values to arrive at the estimated business enterprise value.\nAfter concluding on a business enterprise value, that value is converted into an equity value by subtracting the debt on the balance sheets as of each valuation date. The resultant equity value was divided by the number of outstanding common shares and in-the-money options and warrants at each valuation date to determine the fair value of an individual share of common stock.\nThe valuation specialists also considered the appropriate premiums and discounts that must be assessed in relation to the valuation of CIE's common stock supporting the outstanding options and warrants. The majority of CIE's common stock is owned by CGP LLC. As such, any shares obtained pursuant to options and warrants will have the same inability to control or influence decisions that are subject to shareholder approval as the shares that were obtained in the first quarter 2012 arms-length sale of CIE's common stock to an independent investor and in the fourth quarter sale of CIE's common stock pursuant to the third-party investor's exercise of their purchase option. As such, the common stock valuation methodology used for purposes of valuing stock options did not require any additional discount for lack of control.\nHaving taken the above considerations into account, the fair value of CIE's common stock was then used by an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of CIE's options and warrants.\nShare-based Payments to Non-Employees of CAC or CGP LLC\nOn April 9, 2014, the Board approved the CAC Equity-Based Compensation Plan for CEC Employees for officers and employees of CEC and its subsidiaries as well as certain other individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. CEC will administer the Equity Plan. Under the Equity Plan, CEC is authorized to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock, dividend equivalents, cash awards, rights to purchase or acquire shares or similar securities in the form of or with a value related to our common stock to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries. The Equity Plan will terminate ten years\nafter approval by the Board. Subject to adjustments in connection with certain changes in capitalization, the maximum value of the shares of our Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards under the Equity Plan is $25.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2014, CEC granted awards to officers, employees, directors, individual consultants and advisers of CEC and its subsidiaries in accordance with the Equity Plan in order to reward and provide incentive for services provided in their capacity, promote the success of CGP LLC and more closely align the interests of such individuals with those of the stockholders of the Company. Awards under this plan vest one-third on each of October 21, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Expense associated with the vesting of such awards is recorded as management fee expense by CGP LLC, totaling $11.9 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, such shares will be contributed to CGP LLC by CAC as additional investment into that entity, at which time CGP LLC will settle its management fee obligation with CEC and its subsidiaries through a distribution of such shares to CEC. Also upon issuance of shares pursuant to this plan, CGP LLC will issue an equivalent number of voting units in CGP LLC and distribute those units to CAC. As CAC will receive voting units in CGP LLC in exchange for the shares of CAC issued pursuant to this plan, there is no expected dilutive impact to CAC's Earnings per Share (\"EPS\") (see Note 4 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share).\nInvestment in Senior Notes Previously Issued by a Related Party\nPredecessor Growth Partners' investments in senior notes of approximately $1.1 billion, issued by CEOC, a related party, were classified as available for sale investments and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The CEOC Notes had fixed interest rates ranging from 5.625% to 6.50% and maturities ranging from 2015 to 2017. Any discount or premium was amortized to interest income using the effective interest method. CGP LLC classified the investment in notes from related party as current or long-term depending on the maturity of the instruments along with management's intent on holding such instruments.\nOn May 5, 2014, CGP LLC entered into a note purchase agreement to sell a portion of its CEOC Notes back to CEOC at fair market value. On July 29, 2014, CGP LLC received $451.9 million of consideration (including $3.8 million for interest) in connection with the CEOC Notes purchase transaction and recognized a gain of $99.4 million.\nOn August 6, 2014, CGP LLC effectuated a distribution of its 5.75% and 6.50% CEOC Notes as a dividend to its members, pro-rata based upon each member's ownership percentage in CGP LLC. Immediately prior to the Notes Distribution, CGP LLC recorded an impairment charge of $63.5 million to recognize losses that had been accumulated in equity, given that CGP LLC would not recover its amortized cost basis in the CEOC Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nCGP LLC records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. CGP LLC reduces the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more likely than not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, CGP LLCs' experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.\nThe effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nFor periods reported through October 21, 2013, the provision for income taxes for Predecessor Growth Partners represents the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes as if Predecessor Growth Partners filed separate U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns. For the period from October 22, 2013 through May 2014, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE, which was taxed as a corporation for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, and also includes the allocated income taxes from the consolidated Caesars Entertainment provision for income taxes for the period up to the date of acquisition by CGP LLC for the properties acquired from CEOC in May 2014. For periods subsequent to the May 2014 acquisitions, the provision for income taxes for CGP LLC represents the income taxes from its corporate subsidiary, CIE.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 and under Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Predecessor Growth Partners Combined Financial Statements.\nOther Items\nFormation of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC\nCES, a services joint venture among CEOC, CERP, a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, and CGPH, manages CGP LLC's properties and provides CGP LLC with access to Caesars Entertainment's management expertise, intellectual property, back office services and Total Rewards loyalty program. CES also employs personnel under each property's corresponding property management agreement. Operating expenses are allocated to each Member with respect to their respective properties serviced by CES in accordance with historical allocation methodologies, subject to annual revisions and certain prefunding requirements. Corporate expenses that are not allocated to the properties directly are allocated by CES to CEOC, CERP, and CGPH according to their allocation percentages (initially 70.0%, 24.6% and 5.4%, respectively), subject to annual review. As a result of an annual review undertaken in September 2015 but effective July 2015, the allocation percentages were revised to 65.4%, 21.8% and 12.8%, respectively. CGPH has notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objects to the new expense allocation but will pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserves all rights. On October 1, 2014, CES began operations in Nevada, Louisiana and certain other jurisdictions in which regulatory approval had been received or was not required, including through the commencement of direct employment by CES of certain designated enterprise-wide employees.\nOmnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement\nOn May 20, 2014, the Members entered into the Omnibus Agreement, which granted licenses to the Members and certain of their affiliates in connection with the formation of CES. Initial contributions by the Members included a $22.5 million cash payment by CGP LLC on behalf of CGPH in October 2014. Pursuant to a capital call during the three months ended December 31, 2014, CGP LLC contributed an additional $0.1 million on behalf of CGPH. Pursuant to capital calls during the year ended December 31, 2015, CGPH contributed an additional $3.9 million to CES. On October 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015, the Members transitioned certain executives and employees to CES and the services of such employees were available as part of CES's provision of services to the Members and certain of their affiliates that own properties that require CES services under the Omnibus Agreement.\nUnder the Omnibus Agreement, CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and certain of their subsidiaries that granted CES a non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free license in and to all intellectual property owned or used by such licensors, including all intellectual property (a) currently used, or contemplated to be used, in connection with the properties owned by the Members and their respective affiliates, including any and all intellectual property related to the Total Rewards program, and (b) necessary for the provision of services contemplated by the Omnibus Agreement and by the applicable management agreement for any such property (collectively, the \"Enterprise Assets\").\nCES granted to the properties owned or controlled by the Members, and their respective affiliates, non-exclusive licenses to the Enterprise Assets. CES granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI, CGPH and the properties owned or controlled by the Members licenses to any intellectual property that CES develops or acquires in the future that is not a derivative of the intellectual property licensed to it. CES also granted to CEOC, CLC, CWI and CGPH a non-exclusive license to intellectual property specific to the properties controlled by CGPH, CERP and their subsidiaries for any uses consistent with the uses made by CEOC, CLC, and CWI with respect to such intellectual property prior to the date of the Omnibus Agreement.", "item_7_tables": "Table 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>
