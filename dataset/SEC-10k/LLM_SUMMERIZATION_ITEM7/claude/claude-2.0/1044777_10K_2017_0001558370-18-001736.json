In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below. Please see Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity that protect and facilitate electronic transactions, via mobile and connected devices. We are a global leader in providing anti-fraud and digital transaction management solutions to financial institutions and other businesses. Our solutions secure online and mobile access to accounts, data, assets, and applications for enterprises; provide tools for application developers to easily integrate security functions into their web-based and mobile applications; and facilitate digital transactions involving the signing, sending, and managing of documents. Our core technologies, multi-factor authentication and transaction signing, strengthen the process of preventing hacking attacks against online and mobile transactions to allow companies to transact business safely with remote customers.\nWe offer cloud based and on premises solutions using both open standards and proprietary technologies. Some of our proprietary technologies are patented. Our products and services are used for authentication, fraud mitigation, e-signing transactions and documents, and identity management in Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d), Business-to-Employee ( B2E\u201d) and Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) environments. Our target market is business processes using electronic interface, particularly the Internet, where there is risk of unauthorized access. Our products can increase security associated with accessing business processes, reduce losses from unauthorized access and reduce the cost of the process by automating activities previously performed manually.\nOur Business Model\nWe offer our products through a product sales and licensing model or through our services platform, which includes our cloud-based service offering.\nOur solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our traditional on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.\nIndustry Growth\nWe believe there are no reliable measurements of the industry size or growth rates for the segments that we serve. However, we believe the market for authentication, anti-fraud, and electronic signature solutions will continue to grow driven by new government regulations, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and the growth in electronic commerce. The issues driving growth are global however, the rate of adoption in each country is a function of culture, competitive position, economic conditions and use of technology.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur revenue may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which we currently sell products. With our current concentration of revenue in Europe and specifically in the banking and finance vertical market, significant changes in the economic outlook for the European Banking market may have a significant effect on our revenue.\nCybersecurity Risks\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSoftware and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNew products and services that we introduced to the market are focused on processing information through our servers or in the cloud.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the risks and consequences of potential incidents in each of the above areas are different.\nIn the case of the information systems we use to help us run our business, we believe that an incident could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver product to our customers, but such a delay in these activities would not have a material impact on our overall results. To minimize this risk, we actively use various forms of security and monitor the use of our systems regularly to detect potential incidents as soon as possible.\nIn the case of products that we have traditionally sold, we believe that the risk of a potential cyber incident is minimal. We offer our customers the ability to either create the secret numbers themselves or have us create the numbers on their behalf. When asked to create the numbers, we do so in a secure environment with limited physical access and store the numbers on a system that is not connected to any other network, including other VASCO networks, and similarly, is not connected to the internet.\nIn the case of our new products and services, which involve the active daily processing of the secret numbers on our servers or servers managed by others in a hosted environment, we believe a cyber incident could have a material impact on our future business. We also believe that these products may be more susceptible to cyber attacks than our traditional products since it involves the active processing of transactions using the secret numbers. While we do not have a significant amount of revenue from these products today, we believe that these products have the potential to provide substantial future growth. A cyber incident involving these products in the future could substantially impair our ability to grow the business and we could suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm.\nTo minimize the risk, we review our security procedures on a regular basis. Our reviews include the processes and software programs we are currently using as well as new forms of cyber incidents and new or updated software programs that may be available in the market that would help mitigate the risk of incidents. Certain insurance coverages may apply to certain cyber incidents. Overall, we expect the cost of securing our networks will increase in future periods, whether through increased staff, systems or insurance coverage.\nWhile we did not experience any cyber incident in 2017, 2016, or 2015 that had a significant impact on our business, it is possible that we could experience an incident in 2018 or future years, which could result in unanticipated costs.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nIn 2017, approximately 72% of our revenue and approximately 76% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2016, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. While the majority of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., the majority of our revenue is billed in U.S. Dollars. In 2017, approximately 66% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 29% was denominated in Euros and 5% was denominated in other currencies. In 2016, approximately 69% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 26% was denominated in Euros, and 5% was denominated in other currencies.\nIn general, to minimize the net impact of currency fluctuations on operating income, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency. We expect that changes in currency rates may also impact our future results if we are unable to match amounts of revenue with our operating expenses in the same currency. If the amount of our revenue in Europe denominated in Euros continues as it is now or declines, we may not be able to balance fully the exposures of currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses.\nThe financial position and the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Singapore and Canada, are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates generated comprehensive income of $4.0 million in 2017, and comprehensive losses of $2.5 million and $3.3 million, in 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Canada, and Singapore is the U.S. Dollar.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations as other non-operating income/expense. We reported foreign exchange transaction losses of $0.5 million in 2017, foreign exchange transaction gains of $0.1 million in 2016, and foreign exchange transaction losses of $1.2 million in 2015, respectively.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions and services. We believe comparison of revenues between periods is heavily influenced by the timing of orders and shipments reflecting the transactional nature of our business.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct and license revenue. Product and license revenue includes hardware products and software licenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nService and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, maintenance and support, and professional services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Goods Sold\nOur total cost of goods sold consists of cost of product and license revenue and cost of service and other revenue. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost of product and license revenue. Cost of product and license revenue primarily consists of direct product costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCost of service and other revenue. Cost of service and other revenue primarily consists of costs related to SaaS solutions, including personnel and equipment costs, and personnel costs of employees providing professional services and maintenance and support.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including our average selling price, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue among products, subscriptions and services. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are generally based on anticipated revenue levels and fixed over short periods of time. As a result, small variations in revenue may cause significant variations in the period-to-period comparisons of operating income or operating income as a percentage of revenue.\nGenerally, the most significant factor driving our operating expenses is headcount. Direct compensation and benefit plan expenses generally represent between 55% and 65% of our operating expenses. In addition, a number of other expense categories are directly related to headcount. We attempt to manage our headcount within the context of the economic environments in which we operate and the investments we believe we need to make for our infrastructure to support future growth and for our products to remain competitive.\nIn November 2015, with the acquisition of eSignLive, our headcount increased by 156. Average headcount for the full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 614, 595, and 412, respectively.\nHistorically, operating expenses have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate the change in currency rates in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million in 2017.\nThe comparison of operating expenses can also be impacted significantly by costs related to our stock-based and long-term incentive plans. For full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015, operating expenses included $5.4 million, $4.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively, related to stock-based and long-term incentive plans. Generally, performance awards granted at the beginning of 2016 were not earned. Long-term incentive awards granted at the beginning of 2015 were earned. Long-term incentive plan compensation expense includes both cash and stock-based incentives.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, commissions and bonuses, trade shows, marketing programs and other marketing activities, travel, outside consulting costs, and long-term incentive compensation. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nResearch and development.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, and long term incentive compensation. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their respective amortization periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short-term instruments at current market rates.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate reflects our global structure related to the ownership of our intellectual property ( IP\u201d). All our IP in our traditional authentication business is owned by two subsidiaries, one in the U.S. and one in Switzerland. These two subsidiaries have entered into agreements with most of the other VASCO entities under which those other entities provide services to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries on either a percentage of revenue or on a cost plus basis or both. Under this structure, the earnings of our service provider subsidiaries are relatively constant. These service provider companies tend to be in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates. Fluctuations in earnings tend to flow to the U.S. company and Swiss company. In 2018, earnings flowing to the U.S. company are expected to be taxed at a rate of 21% to 25%, while earnings flowing to the Swiss company are expected to be taxed at a rate ranging from 11% to 12%. Our Canadian subsidiary currently sells and services global customers directly.\nAs the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the U.S., our consolidated effective tax rate is strongly influenced by the effective tax rate of our foreign operations. Changes in the effective rate related to foreign operations reflect changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the tax rates in each of the countries in which it is earned. The statutory tax rate for the primary foreign tax jurisdictions ranges from 11% to 35%.\nThe geographic mix of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily depends on the level of pretax income of our service provider subsidiaries and the benefit realized in Switzerland through the sales of product. The level of pretax income in our service provider subsidiaries is expected to vary based on:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe staff, programs and services offered on a yearly basis by the various subsidiaries as determined by management, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe changes in exchange rates related to the currencies in the service provider subsidiaries, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nthe amount of revenues that the service provider subsidiaries generate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor items 1 and 2 above, there is a direct impact in the opposite direction on earnings of the U.S. and Swiss entities. Any change from item 3 is generally expected to result in a larger change in income in the U.S. and Swiss entities in the direction of the change (increased revenues expected to result in increased margins/pretax profits and conversely decreased revenues expected to result in decreased margins/pretax profits).\nIn addition to the provision of services, the intercompany agreements transfer the majority of the business risk to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries. As a result, the contracting subsidiaries' pretax income is reasonably assured while the pretax income of the U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries varies directly with our overall success in the market.\nIn November 2015, we acquired eSignLive, a foreign company with substantial IP and net operating loss and other tax carryforwards. The tax benefit of the carryforwards has been fully reserved as realization has not been deemed more likely than not.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.\nIn response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.\nWhile our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $28.1 million discrete tax expense in our 2017 financial statements. This expense is primarily comprised of a $2.3 million provisional deferred tax expense from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, an additional $7.3 million provisional deferred tax expense related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, as well as $18.5 million provisional charge for the deemed repatriation tax. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation, as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance, and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods. See Note 6, Income Taxes, for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct and license\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n156,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,800)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nServices and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue by geographic region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,038)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,751)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $1.0 million or 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Product and license revenue decreased by $8.8 million, or 6% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in product and license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in hardware revenue offset partially by an increase in software licenses. Services and other revenue increased by $9.8 million, or 27% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in SaaS and maintenance revenue.\nRevenue generated in EMEA decreased $3.0 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware products partially offset by an increase in software licenses.\nRevenue generated in the Americas increased $19.8 million, or 60% during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The decrease in cost of product and license revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware revenue.\nThe cost of services and other revenue increased $2.0 million, or 24%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of services and other revenue was primarily due to increased services and other revenues and increased SaaS hosting fees.\nGross profit increased $3.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin was 70% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 68% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin primarily reflects an increase in software solutions as a percentage of total revenues.\nThe majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our sales are denominated in various currencies including the Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2017, as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from sales in Euros, as measured in U. S. Dollars, increased, without a corresponding change in the cost of goods sold. The impact of changes in currency rates are estimated to have increased revenue by approximately $1.2 million for the full year of 2017. Had currency rates in the full year of 2017 been equal to rates in the same period in 2016, the gross profit margin would have been approximately 0.2 percentage points lower for the full year of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to headcount and increased marketing investments.

The decrease in the rate is primarily due to increase in losses in higher tax jurisdictions partially offset by the increase in the Swiss tax rate as applicable to VASCO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net cash balances (total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash less bank borrowings) of $78.7 million and short-term investments of $79.7 million. We had no outstanding debt or restricted cash at December 31, 2017. Short term investments at December 31, 2017, consisting of high quality commercial paper with maturities of less than six months, were held by our U.S. and Swiss entities and issued by domestic and foreign corporations.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $18.3 million, of which $1.2 million and $12.8 million were presented within income taxes payable\u201d and income tax payable, non-current,\u201d respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. As permitted by U.S. Tax Reform, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.\nWe also recorded a tax liability for withholding tax for distributing earnings of $7.3 million which is presented in deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $46.9 million of cash held by the United States and had $108.4 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to significant repatriation restrictions and may be subject to tax upon repatriation. However, we have provided for substantially all of the taxes as indicated above.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next twelve months.\nOperating Activities\nCash generated by operating activities is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment, and stock-based compensation. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in personnel cost as we grow our business.\nCash provided by operating activities was $17.6 million, $28.4 million and $68.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, and activity in connection with acquisitions. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment to support the continued growth of our business as well to continue to invest in our infrastructure and activity in connection with acquisitions.\nCash provided by investing activities was $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, and used in investing activities of $56.5 million and $56.0 million during the years ended December 31 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to tax payments for restricted stock issuances.\nCash used in financing activities was $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

These amounts are not included in the above table as the timing of payment of such obligations, if any, is not determinable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, net realizable value of inventory and intangible assets. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software - Revenue Recognition, ASC 985-605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements and Staff Accounting Bulletin 104.\nProduct and License Revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. Services and Other includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nRevenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some of our products are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn our typical multiple-element arrangement, the primary deliverables include:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na client component (i.e., an item that is used by the person being authenticated in the form of either a new standalone hardware device or software that is downloaded onto a device the customer already owns);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nhost system software that is installed on the customer's systems (i.e., software on the host system that verifies the identity of the person being authenticated) or licenses for additional users on the host system software if the host system software had been installed previously; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\npost contract support (PCS) in the form of maintenance on the host system software or support.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur multiple-element arrangements may also include other items that are usually delivered prior to the recognition of any revenue are incidental to the overall transaction such as initialization of the hardware device, customization of the hardware device itself or the packaging in which it is delivered, deployment services where we deliver the device to our customer's end-use customer or employee and, in some limited cases, professional services to assist with the initial implementation of a new customer.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware client device, we allocate the selling price among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on our internal price lists and the percentage of the selling price of that element, per the price list, to the total of the estimated selling price of all of the elements per the price list. Our internal price lists for both delivered and undelivered elements were determined to be reasonable estimates of the selling price of each element based on a comparison of actual sales made to the price list.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a software client device, we continue to account for each element under the current standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software client device and host software are delivered elements, we use the Residual Method for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for token and software licenses if we have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) for all of the undelivered elements. Any discount provided to the customer is applied fully to the delivered elements in such an arrangement. VSOE for undelivered elements is established using the bell curve method.\u201d Under this method, we conclude VSOE exists when a substantial majority of PCS renewals are within a narrow range of pricing. The estimated selling price of PCS items is based on an established percentage of the user license fee attributable to the specific software. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nFor transactions other than multiple-element arrangements, we recognize revenue as follows:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct and License Revenue: Revenue from the sale of computer security hardware or the license of software is recorded upon shipment or, if an acceptance period is allowed, at the latter of shipment or customer acceptance. No significant obligations or contingencies exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSaaS: We generate SaaS revenues from our cloud services offerings. SaaS revenues include fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMaintenance and Support Agreements: Maintenance and support agreements generally call for us to provide software updates and technical support, respectively, to customers.

Revenue from such services is recognized during the period in which the services are performed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate subscription services revenues primarily from our cloud services offerings. Subscription services revenues include subscription fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract.\nWe recognize revenue from sales to distributors and resellers on the same basis as sales made directly to customers. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nFor large-volume transactions, we may negotiate a specific price that is based on the number of users of the software license or quantities of hardware supplied. The per unit prices for large-volume transactions are generally lower than transactions for smaller quantities and the price differences are commonly referred to as volume-purchase discounts.\nAll revenue is reported on a net basis, excluding any sales taxes or value added taxes.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09, as amended, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. This new guidance will require significant amounts of judgements and estimates in implementing its five-step process to be followed in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and related disclosures. Refer to Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our status of adoption/implementation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for goods and services. We analyze accounts receivable, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on a specific review of all significant past-due accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventory\nWe write down inventory where it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory. We analyze the quantity of inventory on hand, the quantity sold in the past year, the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers, the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when evaluating the valuation of our inventory. If the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly, additional write-downs may be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include proprietary technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs, are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived\nasset group exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets, are originally recorded at fair value. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. We assess the impairment of goodwill each November or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company's impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in acquisition accounting. The residual amount after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based variation approaches. The inputs and assumptions to valuation methods used to estimate the fair value of reporting units involves significant judgments.\nWe have not recognized any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax returns that\ndo not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the more likely than not\u201d standard has been meet when developing the provision for income taxes.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. In response to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) issued guidance that allows us to record provisional amounts for the impacts of U.S. tax reform if the full accounting cannot be completed before we file our 2017 financial statements. For provisions of the tax law where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the impact, the guidance allows us to continue to apply the historical tax provisions in computing our income tax liability and deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The guidance also allows us to finalize accounting for the U.S. tax reform changes within one year of the December 22, 2017 enactment date. See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional information on how we recorded the impacts of the U.S. tax reform\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe adopted ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2015-11 requires measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer, usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material impact to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. During 2017, recognized revenue associated with term licenses represented 6% of 2017 revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging and up to four years scheduled. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates the adoption in the effective period and we are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the acquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied\nprospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). During 2017, revenue recognized associated with term licenses, and related PCS, represented approximately 6% of 2017 consolidated revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging up to four years. Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer front, which is usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material reduction to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a\nmanner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the\nacquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. However, early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (in thousands, except head count, ratios, time periods and percents)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below. Please see Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity that protect and facilitate electronic transactions, via mobile and connected devices. We are a global leader in providing anti-fraud and digital transaction management solutions to financial institutions and other businesses. Our solutions secure online and mobile access to accounts, data, assets, and applications for enterprises; provide tools for application developers to easily integrate security functions into their web-based and mobile applications; and facilitate digital transactions involving the signing, sending, and managing of documents. Our core technologies, multi-factor authentication and transaction signing, strengthen the process of preventing hacking attacks against online and mobile transactions to allow companies to transact business safely with remote customers.\nWe offer cloud based and on premises solutions using both open standards and proprietary technologies. Some of our proprietary technologies are patented. Our products and services are used for authentication, fraud mitigation, e-signing transactions and documents, and identity management in Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d), Business-to-Employee ( B2E\u201d) and Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) environments. Our target market is business processes using electronic interface, particularly the Internet, where there is risk of unauthorized access. Our products can increase security associated with accessing business processes, reduce losses from unauthorized access and reduce the cost of the process by automating activities previously performed manually.\nOur Business Model\nWe offer our products through a product sales and licensing model or through our services platform, which includes our cloud-based service offering.\nOur solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our traditional on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.\nIndustry Growth\nWe believe there are no reliable measurements of the industry size or growth rates for the segments that we serve. However, we believe the market for authentication, anti-fraud, and electronic signature solutions will continue to grow driven by new government regulations, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and the growth in electronic commerce. The issues driving growth are global however, the rate of adoption in each country is a function of culture, competitive position, economic conditions and use of technology.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur revenue may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which we currently sell products. With our current concentration of revenue in Europe and specifically in the banking and finance vertical market, significant changes in the economic outlook for the European Banking market may have a significant effect on our revenue.\nCybersecurity Risks\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:\n 1. Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively; \n 2. The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and \n 3. New products and services that we introduced to the market are focused on processing information through our servers or in the cloud. \nWe believe that the risks and consequences of potential incidents in each of the above areas are different.\nIn the case of the information systems we use to help us run our business, we believe that an incident could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver product to our customers, but such a delay in these activities would not have a material impact on our overall results. To minimize this risk, we actively use various forms of security and monitor the use of our systems regularly to detect potential incidents as soon as possible.\nIn the case of products that we have traditionally sold, we believe that the risk of a potential cyber incident is minimal. We offer our customers the ability to either create the secret numbers themselves or have us create the numbers on their behalf. When asked to create the numbers, we do so in a secure environment with limited physical access and store the numbers on a system that is not connected to any other network, including other VASCO networks, and similarly, is not connected to the internet.\nIn the case of our new products and services, which involve the active daily processing of the secret numbers on our servers or servers managed by others in a hosted environment, we believe a cyber incident could have a material impact on our future business. We also believe that these products may be more susceptible to cyber attacks than our traditional products since it involves the active processing of transactions using the secret numbers. While we do not have a significant amount of revenue from these products today, we believe that these products have the potential to provide substantial future growth. A cyber incident involving these products in the future could substantially impair our ability to grow the business and we could suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm.\nTo minimize the risk, we review our security procedures on a regular basis. Our reviews include the processes and software programs we are currently using as well as new forms of cyber incidents and new or updated software programs that may be available in the market that would help mitigate the risk of incidents. Certain insurance coverages may apply to certain cyber incidents. Overall, we expect the cost of securing our networks will increase in future periods, whether through increased staff, systems or insurance coverage.\nWhile we did not experience any cyber incident in 2017, 2016, or 2015 that had a significant impact on our business, it is possible that we could experience an incident in 2018 or future years, which could result in unanticipated costs.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nIn 2017, approximately 72% of our revenue and approximately 76% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2016, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. While the majority of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., the majority of our revenue is billed in U.S. Dollars. In 2017, approximately 66% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 29% was denominated in Euros and 5% was denominated in other currencies. In 2016, approximately 69% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 26% was denominated in Euros, and 5% was denominated in other currencies.\nIn general, to minimize the net impact of currency fluctuations on operating income, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency. We expect that changes in currency rates may also impact our future results if we are unable to match amounts of revenue with our operating expenses in the same currency. If the amount of our revenue in Europe denominated in Euros continues as it is now or declines, we may not be able to balance fully the exposures of currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses.\nThe financial position and the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Singapore and Canada, are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates generated comprehensive income of $4.0 million in 2017, and comprehensive losses of $2.5 million and $3.3 million, in 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Canada, and Singapore is the U.S. Dollar.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations as other non-operating income/expense. We reported foreign exchange transaction losses of $0.5 million in 2017, foreign exchange transaction gains of $0.1 million in 2016, and foreign exchange transaction losses of $1.2 million in 2015, respectively.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions and services. We believe comparison of revenues between periods is heavily influenced by the timing of orders and shipments reflecting the transactional nature of our business.\n \u00b7 Product and license revenue. Product and license revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. \n \u00b7 Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, maintenance and support, and professional services. \nCost of Goods Sold\nOur total cost of goods sold consists of cost of product and license revenue and cost of service and other revenue. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period.\n \u00b7 Cost of product and license revenue. Cost of product and license revenue primarily consists of direct product costs. \n \u00b7 Cost of service and other revenue. Cost of service and other revenue primarily consists of costs related to SaaS solutions, including personnel and equipment costs, and personnel costs of employees providing professional services and maintenance and support. \nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including our average selling price, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue among products, subscriptions and services. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are generally based on anticipated revenue levels and fixed over short periods of time. As a result, small variations in revenue may cause significant variations in the period-to-period comparisons of operating income or operating income as a percentage of revenue.\nGenerally, the most significant factor driving our operating expenses is headcount. Direct compensation and benefit plan expenses generally represent between 55% and 65% of our operating expenses. In addition, a number of other expense categories are directly related to headcount. We attempt to manage our headcount within the context of the economic environments in which we operate and the investments we believe we need to make for our infrastructure to support future growth and for our products to remain competitive.\nIn November 2015, with the acquisition of eSignLive, our headcount increased by 156. Average headcount for the full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 614, 595, and 412, respectively.\nHistorically, operating expenses have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate the change in currency rates in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million in 2017.\nThe comparison of operating expenses can also be impacted significantly by costs related to our stock-based and long-term incentive plans. For full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015, operating expenses included $5.4 million, $4.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively, related to stock-based and long-term incentive plans. Generally, performance awards granted at the beginning of 2016 were not earned. Long-term incentive awards granted at the beginning of 2015 were earned. Long-term incentive plan compensation expense includes both cash and stock-based incentives.\n \u00b7 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, commissions and bonuses, trade shows, marketing programs and other marketing activities, travel, outside consulting costs, and long-term incentive compensation. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and long-term incentive compensation. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, and long term incentive compensation. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their respective amortization periods. \nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short-term instruments at current market rates.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate reflects our global structure related to the ownership of our intellectual property ( IP\u201d). All our IP in our traditional authentication business is owned by two subsidiaries, one in the U.S. and one in Switzerland. These two subsidiaries have entered into agreements with most of the other VASCO entities under which those other entities provide services to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries on either a percentage of revenue or on a cost plus basis or both. Under this structure, the earnings of our service provider subsidiaries are relatively constant. These service provider companies tend to be in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates. Fluctuations in earnings tend to flow to the U.S. company and Swiss company. In 2018, earnings flowing to the U.S. company are expected to be taxed at a rate of 21% to 25%, while earnings flowing to the Swiss company are expected to be taxed at a rate ranging from 11% to 12%. Our Canadian subsidiary currently sells and services global customers directly.\nAs the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the U.S., our consolidated effective tax rate is strongly influenced by the effective tax rate of our foreign operations. Changes in the effective rate related to foreign operations reflect changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the tax rates in each of the countries in which it is earned. The statutory tax rate for the primary foreign tax jurisdictions ranges from 11% to 35%.\nThe geographic mix of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily depends on the level of pretax income of our service provider subsidiaries and the benefit realized in Switzerland through the sales of product. The level of pretax income in our service provider subsidiaries is expected to vary based on:\n 1. the staff, programs and services offered on a yearly basis by the various subsidiaries as determined by management, or \n 2. the changes in exchange rates related to the currencies in the service provider subsidiaries, or \n 3. the amount of revenues that the service provider subsidiaries generate. \nFor items 1 and 2 above, there is a direct impact in the opposite direction on earnings of the U.S. and Swiss entities. Any change from item 3 is generally expected to result in a larger change in income in the U.S. and Swiss entities in the direction of the change (increased revenues expected to result in increased margins/pretax profits and conversely decreased revenues expected to result in decreased margins/pretax profits).\nIn addition to the provision of services, the intercompany agreements transfer the majority of the business risk to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries. As a result, the contracting subsidiaries' pretax income is reasonably assured while the pretax income of the U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries varies directly with our overall success in the market.\nIn November 2015, we acquired eSignLive, a foreign company with substantial IP and net operating loss and other tax carryforwards. The tax benefit of the carryforwards has been fully reserved as realization has not been deemed more likely than not.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.\nIn response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.\nWhile our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $28.1 million discrete tax expense in our 2017 financial statements. This expense is primarily comprised of a $2.3 million provisional deferred tax expense from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, an additional $7.3 million provisional deferred tax expense related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, as well as $18.5 million provisional charge for the deemed repatriation tax. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation, as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance, and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods. See Note 6, Income Taxes, for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduct and license\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n76% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n156,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n81% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,800)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nServices and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n24% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue by geographic region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEMEA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n95,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,038)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmericas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n60% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAPAC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n63,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,751)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(25%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n193,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n192,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased $1.0 million or 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Product and license revenue decreased by $8.8 million, or 6% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in product and license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in hardware revenue offset partially by an increase in software licenses. Services and other revenue increased by $9.8 million, or 27% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in SaaS and maintenance revenue.\nRevenue generated in EMEA decreased $3.0 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware products partially offset by an increase in software licenses.\nRevenue generated in the Americas increased $19.8 million, or 60% during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The decrease in cost of product and license revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware revenue.\nThe cost of services and other revenue increased $2.0 million, or 24%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of services and other revenue was primarily due to increased services and other revenues and increased SaaS hosting fees.\nGross profit increased $3.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin was 70% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 68% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin primarily reflects an increase in software solutions as a percentage of total revenues.\nThe majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our sales are denominated in various currencies including the Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2017, as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from sales in Euros, as measured in U. S. Dollars, increased, without a corresponding change in the cost of goods sold. The impact of changes in currency rates are estimated to have increased revenue by approximately $1.2 million for the full year of 2017. Had currency rates in the full year of 2017 been equal to rates in the same period in 2016, the gross profit margin would have been approximately 0.2 percentage points lower for the full year of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nExpense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n46% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResearch and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(95)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0%) \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n128,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n121,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n7,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6% \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to headcount and increased marketing investments.

The decrease in the rate is primarily due to increase in losses in higher tax jurisdictions partially offset by the increase in the Swiss tax rate as applicable to VASCO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net cash balances (total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash less bank borrowings) of $78.7 million and short-term investments of $79.7 million. We had no outstanding debt or restricted cash at December 31, 2017. Short term investments at December 31, 2017, consisting of high quality commercial paper with maturities of less than six months, were held by our U.S. and Swiss entities and issued by domestic and foreign corporations.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $18.3 million, of which $1.2 million and $12.8 million were presented within income taxes payable\u201d and income tax payable, non-current,\u201d respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. As permitted by U.S. Tax Reform, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.\nWe also recorded a tax liability for withholding tax for distributing earnings of $7.3 million which is presented in deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $46.9 million of cash held by the United States and had $108.4 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to significant repatriation restrictions and may be subject to tax upon repatriation. However, we have provided for substantially all of the taxes as indicated above.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next twelve months.\nOperating Activities\nCash generated by operating activities is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment, and stock-based compensation. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in personnel cost as we grow our business.\nCash provided by operating activities was $17.6 million, $28.4 million and $68.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, and activity in connection with acquisitions. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment to support the continued growth of our business as well to continue to invest in our infrastructure and activity in connection with acquisitions.\nCash provided by investing activities was $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, and used in investing activities of $56.5 million and $56.0 million during the years ended December 31 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to tax payments for restricted stock issuances.\nCash used in financing activities was $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

These amounts are not included in the above table as the timing of payment of such obligations, if any, is not determinable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, net realizable value of inventory and intangible assets. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software - Revenue Recognition, ASC 985-605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements and Staff Accounting Bulletin 104.\nProduct and License Revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. Services and Other includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nRevenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some of our products are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn our typical multiple-element arrangement, the primary deliverables include:\n 1. a client component (i.e., an item that is used by the person being authenticated in the form of either a new standalone hardware device or software that is downloaded onto a device the customer already owns); \n 2. host system software that is installed on the customer's systems (i.e., software on the host system that verifies the identity of the person being authenticated) or licenses for additional users on the host system software if the host system software had been installed previously; and \n 3. post contract support (PCS) in the form of maintenance on the host system software or support. \nOur multiple-element arrangements may also include other items that are usually delivered prior to the recognition of any revenue are incidental to the overall transaction such as initialization of the hardware device, customization of the hardware device itself or the packaging in which it is delivered, deployment services where we deliver the device to our customer's end-use customer or employee and, in some limited cases, professional services to assist with the initial implementation of a new customer.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware client device, we allocate the selling price among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on our internal price lists and the percentage of the selling price of that element, per the price list, to the total of the estimated selling price of all of the elements per the price list. Our internal price lists for both delivered and undelivered elements were determined to be reasonable estimates of the selling price of each element based on a comparison of actual sales made to the price list.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a software client device, we continue to account for each element under the current standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software client device and host software are delivered elements, we use the Residual Method for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for token and software licenses if we have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) for all of the undelivered elements. Any discount provided to the customer is applied fully to the delivered elements in such an arrangement. VSOE for undelivered elements is established using the bell curve method.\u201d Under this method, we conclude VSOE exists when a substantial majority of PCS renewals are within a narrow range of pricing. The estimated selling price of PCS items is based on an established percentage of the user license fee attributable to the specific software. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nFor transactions other than multiple-element arrangements, we recognize revenue as follows:\n 1. Product and License Revenue: Revenue from the sale of computer security hardware or the license of software is recorded upon shipment or, if an acceptance period is allowed, at the latter of shipment or customer acceptance. No significant obligations or contingencies exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. \n 2. SaaS: We generate SaaS revenues from our cloud services offerings. SaaS revenues include fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. \n 3. Maintenance and Support Agreements: Maintenance and support agreements generally call for us to provide software updates and technical support, respectively, to customers. Revenue on maintenance and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance and support agreement. \n 4. Professional Services: We provide professional services to our customers. Revenue from such services is recognized during the period in which the services are performed. \nWe generate subscription services revenues primarily from our cloud services offerings. Subscription services revenues include subscription fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract.\nWe recognize revenue from sales to distributors and resellers on the same basis as sales made directly to customers. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nFor large-volume transactions, we may negotiate a specific price that is based on the number of users of the software license or quantities of hardware supplied. The per unit prices for large-volume transactions are generally lower than transactions for smaller quantities and the price differences are commonly referred to as volume-purchase discounts.\nAll revenue is reported on a net basis, excluding any sales taxes or value added taxes.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09, as amended, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. This new guidance will require significant amounts of judgements and estimates in implementing its five-step process to be followed in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and related disclosures. Refer to Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our status of adoption/implementation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for goods and services. We analyze accounts receivable, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on a specific review of all significant past-due accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventory\nWe write down inventory where it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory. We analyze the quantity of inventory on hand, the quantity sold in the past year, the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers, the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when evaluating the valuation of our inventory. If the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly, additional write-downs may be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include proprietary technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs, are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived\nasset group exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets, are originally recorded at fair value. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. We assess the impairment of goodwill each November or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company's impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in acquisition accounting. The residual amount after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based variation approaches. The inputs and assumptions to valuation methods used to estimate the fair value of reporting units involves significant judgments.\nWe have not recognized any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax returns that\ndo not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the more likely than not\u201d standard has been meet when developing the provision for income taxes.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. In response to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) issued guidance that allows us to record provisional amounts for the impacts of U.S. tax reform if the full accounting cannot be completed before we file our 2017 financial statements. For provisions of the tax law where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the impact, the guidance allows us to continue to apply the historical tax provisions in computing our income tax liability and deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The guidance also allows us to finalize accounting for the U.S. tax reform changes within one year of the December 22, 2017 enactment date. See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional information on how we recorded the impacts of the U.S. tax reform\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe adopted ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2015-11 requires measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer, usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material impact to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. During 2017, recognized revenue associated with term licenses represented 6% of 2017 revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging and up to four years scheduled. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates the adoption in the effective period and we are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the acquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied\nprospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). During 2017, revenue recognized associated with term licenses, and related PCS, represented approximately 6% of 2017 consolidated revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging up to four years. Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer front, which is usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material reduction to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a\nmanner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the\nacquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. However, early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (in thousands, except head count, ratios, time periods and percents)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below. Please see Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe design, develop and market digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity that protect and facilitate electronic transactions, via mobile and connected devices. We are a global leader in providing anti-fraud and digital transaction management solutions to financial institutions and other businesses. Our solutions secure online and mobile access to accounts, data, assets, and applications for enterprises; provide tools for application developers to easily integrate security functions into their web-based and mobile applications; and facilitate digital transactions involving the signing, sending, and managing of documents. Our core technologies, multi-factor authentication and transaction signing, strengthen the process of preventing hacking attacks against online and mobile transactions to allow companies to transact business safely with remote customers.\nWe offer cloud based and on premises solutions using both open standards and proprietary technologies. Some of our proprietary technologies are patented. Our products and services are used for authentication, fraud mitigation, e-signing transactions and documents, and identity management in Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d), Business-to-Employee ( B2E\u201d) and Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) environments. Our target market is business processes using electronic interface, particularly the Internet, where there is risk of unauthorized access. Our products can increase security associated with accessing business processes, reduce losses from unauthorized access and reduce the cost of the process by automating activities previously performed manually.\nOur Business Model\nWe offer our products through a product sales and licensing model or through our services platform, which includes our cloud-based service offering.\nOur solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales force is able to offer customers a choice of an on-site implementation using our traditional on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform.\nIndustry Growth\nWe believe there are no reliable measurements of the industry size or growth rates for the segments that we serve. However, we believe the market for authentication, anti-fraud, and electronic signature solutions will continue to grow driven by new government regulations, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and the growth in electronic commerce. The issues driving growth are global however, the rate of adoption in each country is a function of culture, competitive position, economic conditions and use of technology.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur revenue may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which we currently sell products. With our current concentration of revenue in Europe and specifically in the banking and finance vertical market, significant changes in the economic outlook for the European Banking market may have a significant effect on our revenue.\nCybersecurity Risks\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:\n 1. Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively; \n 2. The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and \n 3. New products and services that we introduced to the market are focused on processing information through our servers or in the cloud. \nWe believe that the risks and consequences of potential incidents in each of the above areas are different.\nIn the case of the information systems we use to help us run our business, we believe that an incident could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver product to our customers, but such a delay in these activities would not have a material impact on our overall results. To minimize this risk, we actively use various forms of security and monitor the use of our systems regularly to detect potential incidents as soon as possible.\nIn the case of products that we have traditionally sold, we believe that the risk of a potential cyber incident is minimal. We offer our customers the ability to either create the secret numbers themselves or have us create the numbers on their behalf. When asked to create the numbers, we do so in a secure environment with limited physical access and store the numbers on a system that is not connected to any other network, including other VASCO networks, and similarly, is not connected to the internet.\nIn the case of our new products and services, which involve the active daily processing of the secret numbers on our servers or servers managed by others in a hosted environment, we believe a cyber incident could have a material impact on our future business. We also believe that these products may be more susceptible to cyber attacks than our traditional products since it involves the active processing of transactions using the secret numbers. While we do not have a significant amount of revenue from these products today, we believe that these products have the potential to provide substantial future growth. A cyber incident involving these products in the future could substantially impair our ability to grow the business and we could suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm.\nTo minimize the risk, we review our security procedures on a regular basis. Our reviews include the processes and software programs we are currently using as well as new forms of cyber incidents and new or updated software programs that may be available in the market that would help mitigate the risk of incidents. Certain insurance coverages may apply to certain cyber incidents. Overall, we expect the cost of securing our networks will increase in future periods, whether through increased staff, systems or insurance coverage.\nWhile we did not experience any cyber incident in 2017, 2016, or 2015 that had a significant impact on our business, it is possible that we could experience an incident in 2018 or future years, which could result in unanticipated costs.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nIn 2017, approximately 72% of our revenue and approximately 76% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2016, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. While the majority of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., the majority of our revenue is billed in U.S. Dollars. In 2017, approximately 66% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 29% was denominated in Euros and 5% was denominated in other currencies. In 2016, approximately 69% of our revenue was denominated in U.S. Dollars, 26% was denominated in Euros, and 5% was denominated in other currencies.\nIn general, to minimize the net impact of currency fluctuations on operating income, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency. We expect that changes in currency rates may also impact our future results if we are unable to match amounts of revenue with our operating expenses in the same currency. If the amount of our revenue in Europe denominated in Euros continues as it is now or declines, we may not be able to balance fully the exposures of currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses.\nThe financial position and the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Singapore and Canada, are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates generated comprehensive income of $4.0 million in 2017, and comprehensive losses of $2.5 million and $3.3 million, in 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in Switzerland, Canada, and Singapore is the U.S. Dollar.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations as other non-operating income/expense. We reported foreign exchange transaction losses of $0.5 million in 2017, foreign exchange transaction gains of $0.1 million in 2016, and foreign exchange transaction losses of $1.2 million in 2015, respectively.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions and services. We believe comparison of revenues between periods is heavily influenced by the timing of orders and shipments reflecting the transactional nature of our business.\n \u00b7 Product and license revenue. Product and license revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. \n \u00b7 Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d) solutions, maintenance and support, and professional services. \nCost of Goods Sold\nOur total cost of goods sold consists of cost of product and license revenue and cost of service and other revenue. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, although it may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period.\n \u00b7 Cost of product and license revenue. Cost of product and license revenue primarily consists of direct product costs. \n \u00b7 Cost of service and other revenue. Cost of service and other revenue primarily consists of costs related to SaaS solutions, including personnel and equipment costs, and personnel costs of employees providing professional services and maintenance and support. \nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including our average selling price, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue among products, subscriptions and services. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on these factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are generally based on anticipated revenue levels and fixed over short periods of time. As a result, small variations in revenue may cause significant variations in the period-to-period comparisons of operating income or operating income as a percentage of revenue.\nGenerally, the most significant factor driving our operating expenses is headcount. Direct compensation and benefit plan expenses generally represent between 55% and 65% of our operating expenses. In addition, a number of other expense categories are directly related to headcount. We attempt to manage our headcount within the context of the economic environments in which we operate and the investments we believe we need to make for our infrastructure to support future growth and for our products to remain competitive.\nIn November 2015, with the acquisition of eSignLive, our headcount increased by 156. Average headcount for the full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 614, 595, and 412, respectively.\nHistorically, operating expenses have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We estimate the change in currency rates in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million in 2017.\nThe comparison of operating expenses can also be impacted significantly by costs related to our stock-based and long-term incentive plans. For full-year 2017, 2016, and 2015, operating expenses included $5.4 million, $4.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively, related to stock-based and long-term incentive plans. Generally, performance awards granted at the beginning of 2016 were not earned. Long-term incentive awards granted at the beginning of 2015 were earned. Long-term incentive plan compensation expense includes both cash and stock-based incentives.\n \u00b7 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, commissions and bonuses, trade shows, marketing programs and other marketing activities, travel, outside consulting costs, and long-term incentive compensation. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales resources in key focus areas, although our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and long-term incentive compensation. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future solutions, although our research and development expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, and long term incentive compensation. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars although our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u00b7 Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their respective amortization periods. \nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short-term instruments at current market rates.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes exchange gains (losses) on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currencies, subsidies received from foreign governments in support of our research and development in those countries and other miscellaneous non-operational expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate reflects our global structure related to the ownership of our intellectual property ( IP\u201d). All our IP in our traditional authentication business is owned by two subsidiaries, one in the U.S. and one in Switzerland. These two subsidiaries have entered into agreements with most of the other VASCO entities under which those other entities provide services to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries on either a percentage of revenue or on a cost plus basis or both. Under this structure, the earnings of our service provider subsidiaries are relatively constant. These service provider companies tend to be in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates. Fluctuations in earnings tend to flow to the U.S. company and Swiss company. In 2018, earnings flowing to the U.S. company are expected to be taxed at a rate of 21% to 25%, while earnings flowing to the Swiss company are expected to be taxed at a rate ranging from 11% to 12%. Our Canadian subsidiary currently sells and services global customers directly.\nAs the majority of our revenues are generated outside of the U.S., our consolidated effective tax rate is strongly influenced by the effective tax rate of our foreign operations. Changes in the effective rate related to foreign operations reflect changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the tax rates in each of the countries in which it is earned. The statutory tax rate for the primary foreign tax jurisdictions ranges from 11% to 35%.\nThe geographic mix of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily depends on the level of pretax income of our service provider subsidiaries and the benefit realized in Switzerland through the sales of product. The level of pretax income in our service provider subsidiaries is expected to vary based on:\n 1. the staff, programs and services offered on a yearly basis by the various subsidiaries as determined by management, or \n 2. the changes in exchange rates related to the currencies in the service provider subsidiaries, or \n 3. the amount of revenues that the service provider subsidiaries generate. \nFor items 1 and 2 above, there is a direct impact in the opposite direction on earnings of the U.S. and Swiss entities. Any change from item 3 is generally expected to result in a larger change in income in the U.S. and Swiss entities in the direction of the change (increased revenues expected to result in increased margins/pretax profits and conversely decreased revenues expected to result in decreased margins/pretax profits).\nIn addition to the provision of services, the intercompany agreements transfer the majority of the business risk to our U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries. As a result, the contracting subsidiaries' pretax income is reasonably assured while the pretax income of the U.S. and Swiss subsidiaries varies directly with our overall success in the market.\nIn November 2015, we acquired eSignLive, a foreign company with substantial IP and net operating loss and other tax carryforwards. The tax benefit of the carryforwards has been fully reserved as realization has not been deemed more likely than not.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted U.S. tax reform that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The legislation also includes a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.\nIn response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a one-year window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.\nWhile our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $28.1 million discrete tax expense in our 2017 financial statements. This expense is primarily comprised of a $2.3 million provisional deferred tax expense from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, an additional $7.3 million provisional deferred tax expense related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, as well as $18.5 million provisional charge for the deemed repatriation tax. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation, as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance, and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods. See Note 6, Income Taxes, for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands) and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue increased $1.0 million or 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Product and license revenue decreased by $8.8 million, or 6% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in product and license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in hardware revenue offset partially by an increase in software licenses. Services and other revenue increased by $9.8 million, or 27% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to an increase in SaaS and maintenance revenue.\nRevenue generated in EMEA decreased $3.0 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware products partially offset by an increase in software licenses.\nRevenue generated in the Americas increased $19.8 million, or 60% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased revenue from non-hardware products, including eSignLive and security software licenses.\nRevenue generated in the Asia Pacific region decreased $15.8 million, or 25% during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decline in hardware revenue.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\n\nThe cost of product and license revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 9% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost of product and license revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware revenue.\nThe cost of services and other revenue increased $2.0 million, or 24%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of services and other revenue was primarily due to increased services and other revenues and increased SaaS hosting fees.\nGross profit increased $3.9 million, or 3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin was 70% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 68% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin primarily reflects an increase in software solutions as a percentage of total revenues.\nThe majority of our inventory purchases are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our sales are denominated in various currencies including the Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2017, as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from sales in Euros, as measured in U. S. Dollars, increased, without a corresponding change in the cost of goods sold. The impact of changes in currency rates are estimated to have increased revenue by approximately $1.2 million for the full year of 2017. Had currency rates in the full year of 2017 been equal to rates in the same period in 2016, the gross profit margin would have been approximately 0.2 percentage points lower for the full year of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to headcount and increased marketing investments. Average full-time sales, marketing, support, and operating employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2017 was 614, compared to 595 for year ended December 31, 2016. Average headcount in 2017 was 3% higher than in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses decreased $0.1 million, or 0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Average full-time research and development employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2017 was 215, compared to 225 for year ended December 31, 2016. Average headcount in 2017 was 4% lower than in 2016, partially attributed to the divestiture of a non-strategic business line in August 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $5.8 million, or 18% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflect increased headcount, professional fees and facilities expense. Professional fees primarily relate to internal controls, legal and internal systems. Average full-time general and administrative employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2017 was 91, compared to 82 for year ended December 31, 2016. Average headcount in 2017 was 11% higher than in 2016.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.8 million, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no significant changes in our amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Income\n\nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.4 million, compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income for 2017 compared to the 2016 reflects an increase in the average interest rate earned on invested balances and an increase in the average invested balance.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other income (expense), net included exchange losses of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to exchange gains of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense for 2017 was $30.8 million, compared to $0.9 million in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2017 was 367%, compared to 8% in 2016. The increase in the rate is primarily due to the repatriation tax, change in permanently reinvested assertion, and tax rate change on deferred tax assets described in Note 6.\nOur future effective tax rate will be affected by U.S. tax reform. Effective in 2018, the U.S. statutory tax rate decreases from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax ( GILTI\u201d).\nLoss Carryforwards Available\nAt December 31, 2017, we have deferred tax assets of $21.7 million resulting from foreign and state NOL carryforwards of $120.5 million and other foreign deductible carryforwards of $31.2 million. At December 31, 2017, we have a valuation allowance of $12.8 million against deferred tax assets related to certain carryforwards. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding carryforwards and valuation allowances.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue decreased $49.1 million or 20% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Product and license revenue decreased by $62.9 million, or 29% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in product and license revenue was driven by a decrease in sales of hardware products, primarily products sold to Rabobank. Services and other revenue increased by $13.7 million, or 61% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in software revenues.\nRevenue generated in EMEA decreased $68.3 million, or 42% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in sales of hardware products, primarily products sold to Rabobank.\nRevenue generated in the Americas increased $7.6 million, or 30% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased revenues from non-hardware products, including eSignLive.\nRevenue generated in the Asia Pacific region increased $11.5 million, or 22% during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was due to increases in hardware products and software licenses sold.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Margin\n\nThe cost of product and license revenue decreased $41.8 million, or 44%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cost of product and license revenue was primarily driven by a decline in our hardware revenue, partially offset by an increase in software licenses.\nThe cost of service and other revenue increased $5.6 million, or 194%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cost of service and other revenue was primarily due to the cost of revenue associated with increased revenue related to the acquisition of eSignLive.\nGross profit decreased $12.9 million, or 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin was 68% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margin primarily reflects an increase in software solutions as a percentage of total revenues.\nOperating Expenses\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $19.1 million, or 50% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased compensation expense and increased marketing initiatives, including trade shows and other marketing efforts in relation to the eSignLive acquisition. Average full-time sales, marketing, support, and operating employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2016 was 288, compared to 199 for year ended December 31, 2015. Average headcount in 2016 was 45% higher than in 2015.\nResearch and development expenses increased $5.8 million, or 33% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased compensation expense related to the eSignLive acquisition. Average full-time research and development employee headcount for year ended December 31,\n2016 was 225, compared to 151 for year ended December 31, 2015. Average headcount in 2016 was 49% higher than in 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $0.8 million, or 3% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects a decrease in professional fees and other expenses partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses from eSignLive. Average full-time general and administrative employee headcount for year ended December 31, 2016 was 82, compared to 62 for year ended December 31, 2015. Average headcount in 2016 was 32% higher than in 2015.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8.8 million, compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of eSignLive in November 2015.\nInterest Income\n\nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net interest income reflected an increase in the average return on invested balances partially offset by a decrease in the average net cash balance. Our return on average net cash balances was 0.6% in 2016 compared to 0.2% in 2015. Average net cash and short term investment balances were $134.5 million in 2016, a decrease of $21.8 million or 14% from $156.3 million in 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.0 million, compared to $0.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other income (expense), net included exchange gains of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to exchange losses of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense for 2016 was $0.9 million, compared to $8.7 million in 2015. The effective tax rate in 2016 was 8%, a decrease of 9 percentage points from 17% in 2015. The decrease in the rate is primarily due to increase in losses in higher tax jurisdictions partially offset by the increase in the Swiss tax rate as applicable to VASCO.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net cash balances (total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash less bank borrowings) of $78.7 million and short-term investments of $79.7 million. We had no outstanding debt or restricted cash at December 31, 2017. Short term investments at December 31, 2017, consisting of high quality commercial paper with maturities of less than six months, were held by our U.S. and Swiss entities and issued by domestic and foreign corporations.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. tax reform was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $18.3 million, of which $1.2 million and $12.8 million were presented within income taxes payable\u201d and income tax payable, non-current,\u201d respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. As permitted by U.S. Tax Reform, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.\nWe also recorded a tax liability for withholding tax for distributing earnings of $7.3 million which is presented in deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $46.9 million of cash held by the United States and had $108.4 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to significant repatriation restrictions and may be subject to tax upon repatriation. However, we have provided for substantially all of the taxes as indicated above.\nWe believe that our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next twelve months.\nOperating Activities\nCash generated by operating activities is primarily comprised of net income, as adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments consist primarily of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment, and stock-based compensation. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in personnel cost as we grow our business.\nCash provided by operating activities was $17.6 million, $28.4 million and $68.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, purchases of property and equipment, and activity in connection with acquisitions. We expect to continue to purchase property and equipment to support the continued growth of our business as well to continue to invest in our infrastructure and activity in connection with acquisitions.\nCash provided by investing activities was $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, and used in investing activities of $56.5 million and $56.0 million during the years ended December 31 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to tax payments for restricted stock issuances.\nCash used in financing activities was $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $6.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, we repaid debt associated with the eSignLive acquisition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n\nTaxes payable represents one-time transition tax payable related to known amounts of cash taxes payable in future years as a result of U.S. tax reform. For further information, refer to Note 6.\nThe company had $0.1 million and $0.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, which have been set aside in a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740 Income Taxes. These amounts are not included in the above table as the timing of payment of such obligations, if any, is not determinable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, net realizable value of inventory and intangible assets. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605, Software - Revenue Recognition, ASC 985-605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements and Staff Accounting Bulletin 104.\nProduct and License Revenue includes hardware products and software licenses. Services and Other includes software as a service ( SaaS\u201d), maintenance and support, and professional services.\nRevenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nIn multiple-element arrangements, some of our products are accounted for under the software provisions of ASC 985-605 and others under the provisions that relate to the sale of non-software products.\nIn our typical multiple-element arrangement, the primary deliverables include:\n 1. a client component (i.e., an item that is used by the person being authenticated in the form of either a new standalone hardware device or software that is downloaded onto a device the customer already owns); \n 2. host system software that is installed on the customer's systems (i.e., software on the host system that verifies the identity of the person being authenticated) or licenses for additional users on the host system software if the host system software had been installed previously; and \n 3. post contract support (PCS) in the form of maintenance on the host system software or support. \nOur multiple-element arrangements may also include other items that are usually delivered prior to the recognition of any revenue are incidental to the overall transaction such as initialization of the hardware device, customization of the hardware device itself or the packaging in which it is delivered, deployment services where we deliver the device to our customer's end-use customer or employee and, in some limited cases, professional services to assist with the initial implementation of a new customer.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a hardware client device, we allocate the selling price among all elements, delivered and undelivered, based on our internal price lists and the percentage of the selling price of that element, per the price list, to the total of the estimated selling price of all of the elements per the price list. Our internal price lists for both delivered and undelivered elements were determined to be reasonable estimates of the selling price of each element based on a comparison of actual sales made to the price list.\nIn multiple-element arrangements that include a software client device, we continue to account for each element under the current standards of ASC 985-605 related to software. When software client device and host software are delivered elements, we use the Residual Method for determining the amount of revenue to recognize for token and software licenses if we have vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) for all of the undelivered elements. Any discount provided to the customer is applied fully to the delivered elements in such an arrangement. VSOE for undelivered elements is established using the bell curve method.\u201d Under this method, we conclude VSOE exists when a substantial majority of PCS renewals are within a narrow range of pricing. The estimated selling price of PCS items is based on an established percentage of the user license fee attributable to the specific software. In sales arrangements where VSOE of fair value has not been established, revenue for all elements is deferred and amortized over the life of the arrangement.\nFor transactions other than multiple-element arrangements, we recognize revenue as follows:\n 1. Product and License Revenue: Revenue from the sale of computer security hardware or the license of software is recorded upon shipment or, if an acceptance period is allowed, at the latter of shipment or customer acceptance. No significant obligations or contingencies exist with regard to delivery, customer acceptance or rights of return at the time revenue is recognized. \n 2. SaaS: We generate SaaS revenues from our cloud services offerings. SaaS revenues include fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. \n 3. Maintenance and Support Agreements: Maintenance and support agreements generally call for us to provide software updates and technical support, respectively, to customers. Revenue on maintenance and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance and support agreement. \n 4. Professional Services: We provide professional services to our customers. Revenue from such services is recognized during the period in which the services are performed. \nWe generate subscription services revenues primarily from our cloud services offerings. Subscription services revenues include subscription fees from customers for access to the eSignLive suite of solutions. Our standard customer arrangements generally do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time. As such, these arrangements are considered service contracts and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the contract.\nWe recognize revenue from sales to distributors and resellers on the same basis as sales made directly to customers. We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is probable.\nFor large-volume transactions, we may negotiate a specific price that is based on the number of users of the software license or quantities of hardware supplied. The per unit prices for large-volume transactions are generally lower than transactions for smaller quantities and the price differences are commonly referred to as volume-purchase discounts.\nAll revenue is reported on a net basis, excluding any sales taxes or value added taxes.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09, as amended, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. This new guidance will require significant amounts of judgements and estimates in implementing its five-step process to be followed in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and related disclosures. Refer to Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our status of adoption/implementation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for goods and services. We analyze accounts receivable, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on a specific review of all significant past-due accounts. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nNet Realizable Value of Inventory\nWe write down inventory where it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory. We analyze the quantity of inventory on hand, the quantity sold in the past year, the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers, the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when evaluating the valuation of our inventory. If the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly, additional write-downs may be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include proprietary technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs, are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived\nasset group exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets, are originally recorded at fair value. Intangible assets other than patents with definite lives are amortized over the useful life, generally three to seven years for proprietary technology and five to twelve years for customer relationships. Patents are amortized over the life of the patent, generally 20 years in the U.S.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. We assess the impairment of goodwill each November or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company's impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results used in the last quantitative goodwill impairment test. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed in light of certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity- and reporting unit specific events. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates. If it is determined under the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. Under the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in acquisition accounting. The residual amount after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting unit under the two-step assessment is determined using a combination of both income and market-based variation approaches. The inputs and assumptions to valuation methods used to estimate the fair value of reporting units involves significant judgments.\nWe have not recognized any impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities and in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax returns that\ndo not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the more likely than not\u201d standard has been meet when developing the provision for income taxes.\nWe monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. In response to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) issued guidance that allows us to record provisional amounts for the impacts of U.S. tax reform if the full accounting cannot be completed before we file our 2017 financial statements. For provisions of the tax law where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the impact, the guidance allows us to continue to apply the historical tax provisions in computing our income tax liability and deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The guidance also allows us to finalize accounting for the U.S. tax reform changes within one year of the December 22, 2017 enactment date. See Note 6 Income Taxes, for additional information on how we recorded the impacts of the U.S. tax reform\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe adopted ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory as of January 1, 2017. ASU 2015-11 requires measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer, usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material impact to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. During 2017, recognized revenue associated with term licenses represented 6% of 2017 revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging and up to four years scheduled. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates the adoption in the effective period and we are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the acquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied\nprospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within such annual periods and applies prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. We have adopted ASU 2015-16 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016. Measurement period adjustments identified subsequent to December 31, 2015 for the eSignLive Acquisition, further described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were recorded and disclosed in accordance with ASU 2015-16.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model to achieve its core principle: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. It also provides guidance on accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. In addition, entities must disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about: (i) the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue under the entity's contracts with customers; (ii) the significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the guidance to those contracts; and (iii) any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe FASB has issued numerous amendments to ASU 2014-09 from August 2015 through January 2018, which provides supplemental and clarifying guidance, as well as amend the effective date of the new standard.\nThe new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 on a modified-retrospective basis. Such method provides the cumulative effect from prior periods upon applying the new guidance to be recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption, including an adjustment to retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted.\nWe expect this new guidance to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition for certain of our multiple element arrangements. Currently, software license revenue from term license sales ( Term Licenses\u201d) is generally recognized ratably over the respective license term ( over time\u201d) due to a lack of VSOE for the PCS that is provided during the Term License. Upon adoption of the new standard, we expect to recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the distinct Term License upon delivery of the software to the customer ( point in time\u201d) and the non-license portion (e.g., PCS) of the transaction price over the respective PCS term ( over time\u201d). During 2017, revenue recognized associated with term licenses, and related PCS, represented approximately 6% of 2017 consolidated revenues. At December 31, 2017, these term arrangements had remaining license periods ranging up to four years. Also, under legacy GAAP when professional services are provided in a Term License for which VSOE of PCS does not exist, the professional services fees are currently recognized over the PCS period as well, as it is typically longer than the period to deliver professional services. Under the new standard, the professional services will be considered a separate performance obligation, and we will recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to the professional services as those services are performed. We also expect the adoption of the new standard to have a significant impact on the nature and extent of disclosures of contracts with customers and related costs.\nWe have determined the significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are sales commissions paid to our sales teams. Under legacy GAAP, we expense sales commissions as earned, and record such amounts as a component of Sales and marketing operating costs in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized sales commission expense of $4,250 in the 2017. Under the new guidance, we expect to capitalize portions of our sales commissions as an asset, and amortize the benefit to expense over an amortization period that will include the expected contract renewals, which we currently estimate may be up to 7 years. However, we will apply the practical expedient to expense commissions as incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. In addition, we will allocate the costs of obtaining a contract in each contract to the performance obligations in the contract and amortize the allocated cost commensurate with the transfer of control of each respective performance obligation. This will generally result in a large portion of the capitalized cost of obtaining the contract to be recognized when software licenses or hardware is delivered to the customer front, which is usually at the outset of the arrangement. At the date of the adoption of this new guidance, we expect to record an asset in our consolidated balance sheets for the amount of unamortized sales commissions for prior periods, as calculated under the new standard. We are finalizing the impact of this adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.\nWe continue to execute our implementation plan, which will continue through the filing of our consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2018. We are completing our stand-alone selling price analyses for certain goods and services, the evaluation of material rights in certain customer contracts, the income tax effect on our transition adjustments, and our evaluation of the new disclosure requirements. We are also finalizing on our newly developed processes and internal controls over revenue recognition and continue to implement system changes and enhancements.\nWe are in the process of evaluating all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018, and we expect to record a material reduction to retained earnings from the adoption of the new standard primarily due to the effect of Term License arrangements discussed above that would have been recognized as revenue in 2018 and beyond. For fiscal year 2018, we expect the financial impact of adoption of the new standard, which has the effect of reducing our 2018 revenue that would have been recognized under legacy GAAP, to be offset by the recognition of Term License revenue from newly executed contracts post-adoption that would have been deferred and recognized over multiple periods under legacy GAAP. However, our assessment of the foregoing is ongoing and subject to finalization, such that the actual impact of the adoption may differ materially from the discussion above.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is the requirement for lessees to report a right to use asset and a lease payment obligation on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a\nmanner similar to today's accounting, and for lessors the guidance remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Such guidance will impact how we account for our investments reported under the cost method of accounting as follows: Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) will be required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values will require a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. The ASU changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit instead of additional paid-in capital; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and (3) accounting for forfeitures. The other provisions of ASU 2016-09 are immaterial to the Company. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted ASU 2016-09 in our consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2016 and applicable aspects described were adopted prospectively. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in an increase to the tax provision of $169 that would have otherwise been debited to additional paid in capital. Similarly, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities decreased $169 and cash flows from financing activities decreased by the same amount. The Company also elected to begin accounting for forfeitures when they occur. The impact of this policy change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. The impact of this ASU on future periods is dependent on our stock price at the time restricted stock awards vest.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance clarifies eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the ASU requires a retrospective application unless it is determined that it is impractical to do so in which case it must be retrospectively applied at the earliest date practical. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The new guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for intercompany asset transfers. The core principle requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations - Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard changes the definition of a business by requiring that at least one substantive process exist in the\nacquired entity. It also states that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge (i.e. Step 2 of the current guidance), instead measuring the impairment charge as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e. Step 1 of the current guidance). The guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance will improve the presentation of pension cost by providing additional guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost in the income statement and on the components eligible for capitalization in assets. The core principle of the ASU is to provide more transparency in the presentation of these costs by requiring the service cost component to be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments require that the Consolidated Statements of Income impacts be applied retrospectively, while Balance Sheet changes should be applied prospectively.\nThe ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. However, early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. The Company will adopt the newly issued ASU as of January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "item_7_tables": "Table 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
