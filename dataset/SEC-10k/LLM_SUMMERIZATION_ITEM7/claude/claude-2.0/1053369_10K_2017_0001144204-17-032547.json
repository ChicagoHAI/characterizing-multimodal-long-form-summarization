You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nBackground\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.\nWe occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ. The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP\u201d) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA\u201d) registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing.\nStrategy\nWe focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ( ANDAs\u201d); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.\nOur focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require new drug applications ( NDAs\u201d) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Drug Price Competition Act\u201d) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.\nProduct Development Activities\nIn January 2016, we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx\u2122, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, we received notification of the FDA's acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA\u201d) of July 14, 2016. On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx\u2122 NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. On December 21, 2016, we met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that we could take to obtain approval of SequestOx\u2122. Based on the FDA response, we believe that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. We believe that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOx\u2122 formulation. Such plan includes, without limitation, conducting bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies, comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation. The fed study is in progress. The Company plans on initiating the fasted study after successful completion of the fed study. Resubmission of the SequestOx\u2122 application requires successful completion of all required studies, including these fed and fasted studies. Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that our intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if we receive marketing approval, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or that any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.\nOn August 9, 2016, we filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Percocet\u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet\u00ae is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Norco\u00ae (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII) 2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nThere can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.\nOn March 22, 2017, European Patent No. 1615623 titled Abuse-Resistant Oral Dosage Forms and Method of Use Thereof\u201d was issued. This patent expands the intellectual property for the Company's opioid abuse deterrent technology. Elite now has four US patents, one European patent, and two Canadian patents issued in this area with additional patents pending in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations:\nYears Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue, Cost of revenue and Gross profit:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufacturing fees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,326,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,002,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(675,907 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Licensing fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,310,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,495,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,184,710 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,637,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,498,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,860,617 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,898,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,484,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,414,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,739,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,014,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,274,860 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-53 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit - percentage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $2.9 million or 23%, to $9.6 million, as compared to $12.5 million, for the corresponding year.\nManufacturing fees decreased by $0.7 million, or 8%, due to decrease in generic Methadone, Hydromorphone and Phentermine sales, partially offset by increases in generic Naltrexone sales.\nLicensing fees decreased by $2.2 million, or 49%. This decrease is primarily due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of a New Drug Application for SequestOx\u2122. This milestone payment was offset by increases in license fees from generic sales licensed to TAGI and Epic.\nCosts of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of revenue increased by $1.4 million or 32%, to $5.9 million as compared to $4.5 million for the corresponding period. The increase in costs of revenue is primarily due to increased and continued investments in Company's facility and resources, and increased regulatory costs, leading to higher overhead absorption rates.\nOur gross profit margin was 39% during the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin is due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOx\u2122, which resulted in a greater gross profit margin in the prior year, as compared to the current year, combined with a product mix consisting of lower margin products and higher overhead absorption rates in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,301,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,428,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,127,090 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,083,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,903,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(819,952 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>333,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(313,278 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,095,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,330,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,235,727 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses.

The decrease was due to the timing and composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a focus on clinical trials for generic products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $2.1 million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 28% from $2.9 million of such costs for the prior year. The decrease was due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives focused on an actual and proportionate reduction of general and administrative expenses, as compared to commercial and product development activities and achieving an operating expense profile with an increased direct correlation to these commercial and product development activities.\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.36 million, an increase of $0.03 million or 7% from $0.33 million of such costs for the prior year. Non-cash compensation expense derives from the timing in amortization of the value of employee stock options issued over the course of the last three years.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 47% from $0.7 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to the combination of increased facility utilization and higher depreciation absorption rates currently as a result of facility expansion and improvements over the last year.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.4 million, compared to a loss from operations of $8.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nOther income (expense):\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(238,223 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(280,670 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of derivative instruments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,525,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,394,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,131,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,299,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,113,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,186,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended March 31, 2017 was net other income of $9.3 million, an increase in net other income of $2.2 million from the net other income of $7.1 million for the comparable period of the prior year.

The increase was primarily due to the expansion and upgrading of the Northvale Facility, which has required substantial investments in property, plant and equipment.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $8.3 million, compared to a loss from operations of $16.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther income (expense):\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(280,670 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(287,231 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of derivative instruments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,394,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,340,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,946,868 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-64 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,670,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,670,685 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,113,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,724,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,610,992 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-67 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income for the year ended March 31, 2016 totaled a net other income of $7.1 million, a decrease in net other income of $14.6 million from the net other income of $21.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was due to the change in the fair value of our outstanding warrants (derivative instruments) during the year ended March 31, 2016 totaling $7.4 million, as compared to a net derivative income of $20.3 million and gain on sale of investment totaling $1.7 for the year ended March 31, 2015, a $14.6 million overall decrease in other income. Please note that the change in fair value of derivative instruments is determined in large part by the number of warrants outstanding and the change in the closing price of our Common Stock as of the end of the year, as compared to the closing price at the beginning of the year, with a strong inverse relationship between derivative revenues and increases in the closing price of our Common Stock.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net loss from operations before the net benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits for the year ended March 31, 2016, including credits for income taxes totaling $0.5 million was $1.2 million, compared to a net income of $5.2 million, inclusive of credit for income taxes totaling $0.003 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nNet benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of Elite, received final approval from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for the sale of net tax benefits. The Company sold the net tax benefits approved for total proceeds of $520,452.\nChange in value of Series I convertible preferred stock:\nChanges in the value in our Series I convertible preferred stock, which is included in the calculation of net loss attributable to common shareholders resulted in the net loss being increased by $9.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, as compared to an increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of $23.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for the year ended March 31, 2016 was net loss of $10.0 million, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $28.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,412,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,713,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,698,764 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,344,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,640,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,295,443 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,067,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,073,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,994,207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company considers cash and working capital balances as several of the factors the Company uses in evaluating its performance, without limitation. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash on hand of $10.6 million and a working capital surplus of $15.1 million. The Company believes that such resources, combined with the Company's access to the new equity line with Lincoln Park Capital (see below), are sufficient to fund operations through the current operating cycle. For the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company had losses from operations totaling $7.4 million, net other income totaling $9.3 million and net income of $3.8 million. In addition, changes in the carrying value of preferred share mezzanine equity for the year ended March 31, 2017 were an increase of $20.7 million, with such amount being charged to net income available to common shareholders. Please note that the Company's other income/(expenses) and net income available to common shareholders are significantly influenced by the fluctuations in the fair value of outstanding preferred share and warrant derivatives, and that such fair values bear a strong, inverse correlation to the market share price of the Company's Common Stock.\nOur working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) increased by $3.0 million from $12.1 million as of March 31, 2016 to $15.1 million as of March 31, 2017, with such increase being primarily related to capital financings that included $7.6 million in proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and $1.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and options, offset in large part by purchases of fixed assets and leasehold improvements totaling $1.1 million and payment on principal of $0.2 million in NJEDA Bonds and other loans. Please note that capital financings provide cash to the Company without a corresponding current liability and accordingly have an accretive effect on working capital.\nThe Company does not anticipate being profitable for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, due in large part to its plans to conduct clinical development and commercialization activities on a range of abuse deterrent opioid products, on an accelerated and simultaneous basis. Such activities require the investment of significant amounts in clinical trials, safety and efficacy studies, bioequivalence studies, product manufacturing, regulatory expertise and filings, as well as investments in manufacturing and lab equipment and software. In order to finance these significant expenditures, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, with such agreement providing the Company with an equity line totaling $40 million. We believe this amount of financing, if received, is sufficient to fund the commercialization of the abuse deterrent opioid products identified. Please see below for further details on the financing transactions with Lincoln Park.\nIn addition, the Company had previously received Notices of Default from the Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of the debt service reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the company's failure to make scheduled principal payments. All monetary defaults have been cured during Fiscal 2015 and the Company is current on all NJEDA Bond interest and principal payments. See NJEDA Bonds\u201d below and the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled A notice of default was issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in relation to prior obligations of our tax-exempt bonds. Although we are current in our payments under these bonds, If the principal balances due under these bonds are accelerated pursuant to the notice of default, our ability to operate in the future will be materially and adversely affected\u201d.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,883,861 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,765,421 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,103,233 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,104,976 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,948,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,879,213 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,071,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,762,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,746,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended March 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.9 million, which included net income of $3.8 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park had agreed to purchase from us up to $40 million of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over a 36-month period.\nUpon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 1,928,641 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as consideration for its commitment to purchase additional shares of our common stock under that agreement and were obligated to issue up to an additional 1,928,641 commitment shares to Lincoln Park pro rata as up to $40 million of our common stock is purchased by Lincoln Park.\nThe 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement expired on June 1, 2017. During the term of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 110.6 million shares to Lincoln Park, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $27.0 million. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 3.2 million commitment shares.\nOn May 1, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d), together with a registration rights agreement (the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement\u201d), with Lincoln Park.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $40 million in shares of our common stock ( Common Stock\u201d), subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on June 5, 2017. We may direct Lincoln Park, at our sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock on any business day, provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent purchase, increasing to up to 1,000,000 shares, depending upon the closing sale price of the Common Stock (such purchases, Regular Purchases\u201d). However, in no event shall a Regular Purchase be more than $1,000,000. The purchase price of shares of Common Stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. In addition, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases under certain circumstances. Our sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nIn connection with the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued to Lincoln Park 5,540,550 shares of Common Stock and we are required to issue up to 5,540,550 additional shares of Common Stock pro rata as we require Lincoln Park to purchase our shares under the Purchase Agreement over the term of the agreement. Lincoln Park has represented to us, among other things, that it is an accredited investor\u201d (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d)). We sold the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The securities sold may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nThe 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement and the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations. There are no trading volume requirements or, other than the limitation on beneficial ownership discussed above, restrictions under the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.\nThe net proceeds received by us under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our stock to Lincoln Park. We anticipate that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will be used for research and product development, general corporate purposes and working capital requirements.\nA registration statement on form S-3 was filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 and was declared effective on June 5, 2017.\nHakim $1,000,000 Bridge Revolving Credit Line\nOn October 15, 2013 (the Hakim Credit Line Effective Date\u201d), and as amended on January 4, 2015, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (the Hakim Loan Agreement\u201d) with Nasrat Hakim, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and CEO.

Please see Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs\u201d)\u201d in Part I, Item 1 Business, above for more information on the Acquisition. The Mikah Note was amended on February 7, 2014 to make it convertible into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Mikah Note, as amended, was interest free and due and payable on the third anniversary of its issuance. Subject to certain limitations, the principal amount of the Mikah Note was convertible at the option of Mikah into shares of Common Stock at a rate of $0.07 (approximately 14,286 shares per $1,000 in principal amount), the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date that the asset purchase agreement and Note were executed and/or into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock at the rate of 1 share of Series I Preferred Stock for each $100,000 of principal owed on the Mikah Note. The conversion rate was adjustable for customary corporate actions such as stock splits and, subject to certain exclusions, includes weighted average anti-dilution for common stock transactions at prices below the then applicable conversion rate. Pursuant to a security agreement (the Security Agreement\u201d), repayment of the Mikah Note was secured by the ANDAs acquired in the Acquisition.\nOn February 7, 2014, Mikah converted the principal amount of $10,000,000, representing the entire principal balance due under the Mikah Note, into 100 shares of the Company's Series I Preferred Stock, and was retired.\nNJEDA Bonds\nOn August 31, 2005, the Company successfully completed a refinancing of a prior 1999 bond issue through the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds (the Bonds\u201d). The refinancing involved borrowing $4,155,000, evidenced by a 6.5% Series A Note in the principal amount of $3,660,000 maturing on September 1, 2030 and a 9% Series B Note in the principal amount of $495,000 maturing on September 1, 2012. The net proceeds, after payment of issuance costs, were used (i) to redeem the outstanding tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority on September 2, 1999, (ii) refinance other equipment financing and (iii) for the purchase of certain equipment to be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. As of March 31, 2016, all of the proceeds were utilized by the Company for such stated purposes.\nInterest is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Bonds are collateralized by a first lien on the Company's facility and equipment acquired with the proceeds of the original and refinanced Bonds. The related Indenture requires the maintenance of a Debt Service Reserve Fund of $366,000 in relation to the Series A Notes.\nBond issue costs of $354,000 were paid from the bond proceeds and are being amortized over the life of the bonds. Amortization of bond issuance costs amounted to $14,179 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe NJEDA Bonds require the Company to make an annual principal payment on September 1st of varying amounts as specified in the loan documents and semi-annual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st, equal to interest due on the outstanding principal at the applicable rate for the semi-annual period just ended.\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no interest or principal amounts in arrears.

Due to the relevance to the Company's operations, of the facility at 135 Ludlow Avenue, the Company expects to exercise the first five-year option. If such option were to be exercised, a new contractual obligation would be created, with payments totaling $1.2 million, exclusive of real estate taxes and insurance, over the full five-year term of the option period. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe are subject to price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the products that we sell. Management does not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCybersecurity\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company had no reportable incidents of cybersecurity.\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company enters into licensing, manufacturing and development agreements, which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including, without limitation, milestones, licensing fees, product sales and services. These multiple elements are assessed in accordance with ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements in order to determine whether particular components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting.\nAn arrangement component is considered to be a separate unit of accounting if the deliverable relating to the component has value to the customer on a standalone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in control of the Company.\nThe Company recognizes payments received pursuant to a multiple revenue agreement as revenue, only if the related delivered item(s) have stand-alone value, with the arrangement being accordingly accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. If such delivered item(s) are considered to either not have stand-alone value, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, and the payments received are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when performance obligations relating to the item(s) will be performed.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, it determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. If it cannot reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete its performance obligations under a multiple-element arrangement, revenues are then recognized on a straight-line basis over the period encompassing the expected completion of such obligations, with such period being reassessed at each subsequent reporting period.\nArrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price (the relative selling price method). When applying the relative selling price method, the selling price of each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if such exists; otherwise, third-part evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method. In deciding whether we can determine vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, the Company does not ignore information that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort.\nWhen determining the selling price for significant deliverables under a multiple-element revenue arrangement, the Company considers any or all of the following, without limitation, depending on information available or information that could be reasonably available without undue cost and effort: vendor-specific objective evidence, third party evidence or best estimate of selling price. More specifically, factors considered can include, without limitation and as appropriate, size of market for a specific product, number of suppliers and other competitive market factors, forecast market shares and gross profits, barriers/time frames to market entry/launch, intellectual property rights and protections, exclusive or non-exclusive arrangements, costs of similar/identical deliverables from third parties, contractual terms, including, without limitation, length of contract, renewal rights, commercial terms, profit allocations, and other commercial, financial, tangible and intangible factors that may be relevant in the valuation of a specific deliverable.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMilestone payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-28, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method for any deliverables or units of accounting under which the Company must achieve a defined performance obligation which is contingent upon future events or circumstances that are uncertain as of the inception of the arrangement providing for such future milestone payment. Determination of the substantiveness of a milestone is a matter of subjective assessment performed at the inception of the arrangement, and with consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meeting all of the following:\nTable 189: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>It must be either commensurate with the Company's performance in achieving the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company's performance to achieve the milestone; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>It relates solely to past performance; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaborative Arrangements\nContracts are considered to be collaborative arrangements when they satisfy the following criteria defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements:\nTable 192: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The parties to the contract must actively participate in the joint operating activity; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The joint operating activity must expose the parties to the possibility of significant risk and rewards, based on whether or not the activity is successful. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement with Epic Pharma LLC, dated June 4, 2015 (the 2015 Epic License Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company entered into a Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC dated August 24, 2016 (the SunGen Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs to acquire intangible assets; if such assets are determined to have a finite useful life they are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Costs to acquire indefinite lived intangible assets, such as costs related to ANDAs are capitalized accordingly.\nThe Company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of March 31st) and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others and without limitation: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate of the Company's segments; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates.\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be realizable in the future.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. These tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The cost of the stock-based payments to nonemployees that are fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at that date, unless there is a contractual term for services in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.\nIn accordance with the Company's Director compensation policy and certain employment contracts, director's fees and a portion of employee's salaries are to be paid via the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash, with the valuation of such share being calculated on a quarterly basis and equal to the simple average closing price of the Company's common stock.\nWarrants and Preferred Shares\nThe accounting treatment of warrants and preferred share series issued is determined pursuant to the guidance provided by ASC 470, Debt, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as applicable. Each feature of a freestanding financial instruments including, without limitation, any rights relating to subsequent dilutive issuances, dividend issuances, equity sales, rights offerings, forced conversions, optional redemptions, automatic monthly conversions, dividends and exercise are assessed with determinations made regarding the proper classification in the Company's financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-3\u201d). ASU 2015-3 revises previous guidance to require that debt issuance costs be reported in the audited consolidated financial statements as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the amendments, debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred charge (i.e. an asset) on the audited consolidated financial statements. This new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2015, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The amendments must be applied retrospectively. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03. Refer to Note 2 Change in Accounting Principle for the effect of adopting ASU 2015-03 on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendments in this update deferred the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim reporting periods within that period. Topic 606 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 and related ASUs noted below on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom March through December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2015-14.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-11 clarify the determination of net realizable value of inventory, applicable to measurement of inventory asset value on the balance sheet. The amendments do not change the core principal of the guidance provided in Topic 330, specifically the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market value, with market value being determined by the net realizable value of the inventory item(s). The amendments clarify, however, that net realizable value is to be measured as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-02 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-09 provide revised guidance in relation to the following with regards to share based payments: i) Accounting for forfeitures, ii) Income tax effects, and iii) classification of excess tax benefits. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero-coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-15 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement cash flows. The new standard is expected to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-18 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d (ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a set\u201d), is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment\u201d (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and an entity should apply the amendments of ASU 2017-04 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting\u201d (ASU 2017-09). ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces both (i) diversity in practice and (ii) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all three of the following are met: (1) The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement is used) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. If the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification. (2) The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. (3) The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. Note that the current disclosure requirements in Topic 718 apply regardless of whether an entity is required to apply modification accounting under the amendments in ASU 2017-09. ASU 2017-09 is effective for all annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, is intended to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nBackground\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.\nWe occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ. The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP\u201d) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA\u201d) registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing.\nStrategy\nWe focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ( ANDAs\u201d); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.\nOur focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require new drug applications ( NDAs\u201d) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Drug Price Competition Act\u201d) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.\n 57 \nWe believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.\nProduct Development Activities\nIn January 2016, we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOxTM, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, we received notification of the FDA's acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA\u201d) of July 14, 2016. On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOxTM NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. On December 21, 2016, we met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that we could take to obtain approval of SequestOxTM. Based on the FDA response, we believe that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. We believe that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOxTM formulation. Such plan includes, without limitation, conducting bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies, comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation. The fed study is in progress. The Company plans on initiating the fasted study after successful completion of the fed study. Resubmission of the SequestOxTM application requires successful completion of all required studies, including these fed and fasted studies. Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that our intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if we receive marketing approval, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or that any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.\nOn August 9, 2016, we filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Percocet\u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet\u00ae is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Norco\u00ae (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII) 2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nThere can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.\nOn March 22, 2017, European Patent No. 1615623 titled Abuse-Resistant Oral Dosage Forms and Method of Use Thereof\u201d was issued. This patent expands the intellectual property for the Company's opioid abuse deterrent technology.

This decrease is primarily due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of a New Drug Application for SequestOxTM. This milestone payment was offset by increases in license fees from generic sales licensed to TAGI and Epic.\nCosts of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of revenue increased by $1.4 million or 32%, to $5.9 million as compared to $4.5 million for the corresponding period. The increase in costs of revenue is primarily due to increased and continued investments in Company's facility and resources, and increased regulatory costs, leading to higher overhead absorption rates.\nOur gross profit margin was 39% during the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin is due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOxTM, which resulted in a greater gross profit margin in the prior year, as compared to the current year, combined with a product mix consisting of lower margin products and higher overhead absorption rates in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,301,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,428,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,127,090 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-33 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,083,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,903,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(819,952 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>333,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(313,278 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-47 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,095,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,330,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,235,727 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses.

The decrease was due to the timing and composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a focus on clinical trials for generic products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $2.1 million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 28% from $2.9 million of such costs for the prior year. The decrease was due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives focused on an actual and proportionate reduction of general and administrative expenses, as compared to commercial and product development activities and achieving an operating expense profile with an increased direct correlation to these commercial and product development activities.\n 59 \nNon-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.36 million, an increase of $0.03 million or 7% from $0.33 million of such costs for the prior year. Non-cash compensation expense derives from the timing in amortization of the value of employee stock options issued over the course of the last three years.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 47% from $0.7 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to the combination of increased facility utilization and higher depreciation absorption rates currently as a result of facility expansion and improvements over the last year.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.4 million, compared to a loss from operations of $8.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nOther income (expense):\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollars </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(238,223 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(280,670 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of derivative instruments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,525,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,394,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,131,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,299,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,113,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,186,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended March 31, 2017 was net other income of $9.3 million, an increase in net other income of $2.2 million from the net other income of $7.1 million for the comparable period of the prior year.

For the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company had losses from operations totaling $7.4 million, net other income totaling $9.3 million and net income of $3.8 million. In addition, changes in the carrying value of preferred share mezzanine equity for the year ended March 31, 2017 were an increase of $20.7 million, with such amount being charged to net income available to common shareholders. Please note that the Company's other income/(expenses) and net income available to common shareholders are significantly influenced by the fluctuations in the fair value of outstanding preferred share and warrant derivatives, and that such fair values bear a strong, inverse correlation to the market share price of the Company's Common Stock.\nOur working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) increased by $3.0 million from $12.1 million as of March 31, 2016 to $15.1 million as of March 31, 2017, with such increase being primarily related to capital financings that included $7.6 million in proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and $1.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and options, offset in large part by purchases of fixed assets and leasehold improvements totaling $1.1 million and payment on principal of $0.2 million in NJEDA Bonds and other loans. Please note that capital financings provide cash to the Company without a corresponding current liability and accordingly have an accretive effect on working capital.\nThe Company does not anticipate being profitable for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, due in large part to its plans to conduct clinical development and commercialization activities on a range of abuse deterrent opioid products, on an accelerated and simultaneous basis. Such activities require the investment of significant amounts in clinical trials, safety and efficacy studies, bioequivalence studies, product manufacturing, regulatory expertise and filings, as well as investments in manufacturing and lab equipment and software. In order to finance these significant expenditures, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, with such agreement providing the Company with an equity line totaling $40 million. We believe this amount of financing, if received, is sufficient to fund the commercialization of the abuse deterrent opioid products identified. Please see below for further details on the financing transactions with Lincoln Park.\nIn addition, the Company had previously received Notices of Default from the Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of the debt service reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the company's failure to make scheduled principal payments. All monetary defaults have been cured during Fiscal 2015 and the Company is current on all NJEDA Bond interest and principal payments. See NJEDA Bonds\u201d below and the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled A notice of default was issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in relation to prior obligations of our tax-exempt bonds. Although we are current in our payments under these bonds, If the principal balances due under these bonds are accelerated pursuant to the notice of default, our ability to operate in the future will be materially and adversely affected\u201d.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended March 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,883,861 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,765,421 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,103,233 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,104,976 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,948,829 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,879,213 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,071,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,762,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,746,424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 63 \nYear Ended March 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.9 million, which included net income of $3.8 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million.

This consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to Lincoln Park Capital of $13.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and option exercises of $0.8 million; offset by $0.2 million in other loan principal payments and $1.1 million related to payment of NJEDA bonds.\nOverall, as a result of the foregoing, the Company had a net increase in cash of $0.5 million during Fiscal 2015.\nLincoln Park Capital\nOn April 10, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park (the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park had agreed to purchase from us up to $40 million of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over a 36-month period.\nUpon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 1,928,641 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as consideration for its commitment to purchase additional shares of our common stock under that agreement and were obligated to issue up to an additional 1,928,641 commitment shares to Lincoln Park pro rata as up to $40 million of our common stock is purchased by Lincoln Park.\nThe 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement expired on June 1, 2017. During the term of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 110.6 million shares to Lincoln Park, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $27.0 million. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 3.2 million commitment shares.\nOn May 1, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d), together with a registration rights agreement (the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement\u201d), with Lincoln Park.\n 64 \nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $40 million in shares of our common stock ( Common Stock\u201d), subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on June 5, 2017. We may direct Lincoln Park, at our sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock on any business day, provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent purchase, increasing to up to 1,000,000 shares, depending upon the closing sale price of the Common Stock (such purchases, Regular Purchases\u201d). However, in no event shall a Regular Purchase be more than $1,000,000. The purchase price of shares of Common Stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. In addition, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases under certain circumstances. Our sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nIn connection with the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued to Lincoln Park 5,540,550 shares of Common Stock and we are required to issue up to 5,540,550 additional shares of Common Stock pro rata as we require Lincoln Park to purchase our shares under the Purchase Agreement over the term of the agreement. Lincoln Park has represented to us, among other things, that it is an accredited investor\u201d (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d)). We sold the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The securities sold may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nThe 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement and the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations. There are no trading volume requirements or, other than the limitation on beneficial ownership discussed above, restrictions under the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.\nThe net proceeds received by us under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our stock to Lincoln Park. We anticipate that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will be used for research and product development, general corporate purposes and working capital requirements.\nA registration statement on form S-3 was filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 and was declared effective on June 5, 2017.\nHakim $1,000,000 Bridge Revolving Credit Line\nOn October 15, 2013 (the Hakim Credit Line Effective Date\u201d), and as amended on January 4, 2015, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (the Hakim Loan Agreement\u201d) with Nasrat Hakim, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and CEO. Under the terms of the Hakim Loan Agreement, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to a line of credit ( Hakim Credit Line\u201d) in the maximum principal amount of up to $1,000,000 at any one time. Mr. Hakim provided the Credit Line for the purpose of supporting the acceleration of our product development activities. The outstanding amount matured on March 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the Hakim Credit Line bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. As of March 31, 2016, the principal balance owed under the Credit Line was $718k with an additional $71k in accrued interest being also owed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Line. The entire principal amount due under the Hakim Credit Line, which expired on March 31, 2016, was paid on May 24, 2016. An additional $9k in interest, accrued at an annual rate of 10%, was incurred on the principal balance outstanding during the period beginning on April 1, 2016 and ending on May 24, 2016, the date on which the principal balance was paid. All interest amounts owed in relation to principal balances outstanding on the Hakim Credit Line and consisting of interest amounts due and owing as of March 31, 2016 and interest amounts incurred subsequent to March 31, 2016 and up to the date of principal repayment, were paid on May 24, 2016.\n 65 \nConvertible Note Payable to Mikah Pharma LLC\nOn August 1, 2013, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, executed an asset purchase agreement (the Mikah Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Mikah Pharma LLC ( Mikah\u201d), an entity that is wholly owned by Mr. Nasrat Hakim, who, in conjunction with this transaction, was appointed as Elite's CEO, President and a Director on August 2, 2012, and acquired from Mikah a total of 13 Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs\u201d) consisting of 12 ANDAs approved by the FDA and one ANDA under active review with the FDA, and all amendments thereto (the Acquisition\u201d) for aggregate consideration of $10,000,000, inclusive of imputed interest payable pursuant to a non-interest bearing, secured convertible note due in August 2016 (the Mikah Note\u201d). Please see Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs\u201d)\u201d in Part I, Item 1 Business, above for more information on the Acquisition. The Mikah Note was amended on February 7, 2014 to make it convertible into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Mikah Note, as amended, was interest free and due and payable on the third anniversary of its issuance. Subject to certain limitations, the principal amount of the Mikah Note was convertible at the option of Mikah into shares of Common Stock at a rate of $0.07 (approximately 14,286 shares per $1,000 in principal amount), the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date that the asset purchase agreement and Note were executed and/or into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock at the rate of 1 share of Series I Preferred Stock for each $100,000 of principal owed on the Mikah Note. The conversion rate was adjustable for customary corporate actions such as stock splits and, subject to certain exclusions, includes weighted average anti-dilution for common stock transactions at prices below the then applicable conversion rate. Pursuant to a security agreement (the Security Agreement\u201d), repayment of the Mikah Note was secured by the ANDAs acquired in the Acquisition.\nOn February 7, 2014, Mikah converted the principal amount of $10,000,000, representing the entire principal balance due under the Mikah Note, into 100 shares of the Company's Series I Preferred Stock, and was retired.\nNJEDA Bonds\nOn August 31, 2005, the Company successfully completed a refinancing of a prior 1999 bond issue through the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds (the Bonds\u201d). The refinancing involved borrowing $4,155,000, evidenced by a 6.5% Series A Note in the principal amount of $3,660,000 maturing on September 1, 2030 and a 9% Series B Note in the principal amount of $495,000 maturing on September 1, 2012. The net proceeds, after payment of issuance costs, were used (i) to redeem the outstanding tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority on September 2, 1999, (ii) refinance other equipment financing and (iii) for the purchase of certain equipment to be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. As of March 31, 2016, all of the proceeds were utilized by the Company for such stated purposes.\nInterest is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Bonds are collateralized by a first lien on the Company's facility and equipment acquired with the proceeds of the original and refinanced Bonds. The related Indenture requires the maintenance of a Debt Service Reserve Fund of $366,000 in relation to the Series A Notes.\nBond issue costs of $354,000 were paid from the bond proceeds and are being amortized over the life of the bonds. Amortization of bond issuance costs amounted to $14,179 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\n 66 \nThe NJEDA Bonds require the Company to make an annual principal payment on September 1st of varying amounts as specified in the loan documents and semi-annual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st, equal to interest due on the outstanding principal at the applicable rate for the semi-annual period just ended.\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no interest or principal amounts in arrears. The Series B Notes were retired, at par in July 2014.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our enforceable and legally binding non-cancellable obligations as of March 31, 2017:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,537,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>289,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>570,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,360,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,045,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>436,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,075,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434,525 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other long-term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Consists of lease payments pursuant to the operating lease for 135 Ludlow Ave for a period, exclusive of taxes and insurance, expiring on December 31, 2021. The lease also includes an additional five-year option, exercised at the sole discretion of the Company and at fixed rates, which are defined in the lease. Due to the relevance to the Company's operations, of the facility at 135 Ludlow Avenue, the Company expects to exercise the first five-year option. If such option were to be exercised, a new contractual obligation would be created, with payments totaling $1.2 million, exclusive of real estate taxes and insurance, over the full five-year term of the option period. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe are subject to price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the products that we sell. Management does not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCybersecurity\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company had no reportable incidents of cybersecurity.\n 67 \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company enters into licensing, manufacturing and development agreements, which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including, without limitation, milestones, licensing fees, product sales and services. These multiple elements are assessed in accordance with ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements in order to determine whether particular components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting.\nAn arrangement component is considered to be a separate unit of accounting if the deliverable relating to the component has value to the customer on a standalone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in control of the Company.\nThe Company recognizes payments received pursuant to a multiple revenue agreement as revenue, only if the related delivered item(s) have stand-alone value, with the arrangement being accordingly accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. If such delivered item(s) are considered to either not have stand-alone value, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, and the payments received are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when performance obligations relating to the item(s) will be performed.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, it determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. If it cannot reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete its performance obligations under a multiple-element arrangement, revenues are then recognized on a straight-line basis over the period encompassing the expected completion of such obligations, with such period being reassessed at each subsequent reporting period.\nArrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price (the relative selling price method). When applying the relative selling price method, the selling price of each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if such exists; otherwise, third-part evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method. In deciding whether we can determine vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, the Company does not ignore information that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort.\nWhen determining the selling price for significant deliverables under a multiple-element revenue arrangement, the Company considers any or all of the following, without limitation, depending on information available or information that could be reasonably available without undue cost and effort: vendor-specific objective evidence, third party evidence or best estimate of selling price. More specifically, factors considered can include, without limitation and as appropriate, size of market for a specific product, number of suppliers and other competitive market factors, forecast market shares and gross profits, barriers/time frames to market entry/launch, intellectual property rights and protections, exclusive or non-exclusive arrangements, costs of similar/identical deliverables from third parties, contractual terms, including, without limitation, length of contract, renewal rights, commercial terms, profit allocations, and other commercial, financial, tangible and intangible factors that may be relevant in the valuation of a specific deliverable.\n 68 \nMilestone payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-28, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method for any deliverables or units of accounting under which the Company must achieve a defined performance obligation which is contingent upon future events or circumstances that are uncertain as of the inception of the arrangement providing for such future milestone payment. Determination of the substantiveness of a milestone is a matter of subjective assessment performed at the inception of the arrangement, and with consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meeting all of the following:\n \u00b7 It must be either commensurate with the Company's performance in achieving the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company's performance to achieve the milestone; and \n \u00b7 It relates solely to past performance; and \n \u00b7 It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement. \nCollaborative Arrangements\nContracts are considered to be collaborative arrangements when they satisfy the following criteria defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements:\n \u00b7 The parties to the contract must actively participate in the joint operating activity; and \n \u00b7 The joint operating activity must expose the parties to the possibility of significant risk and rewards, based on whether or not the activity is successful. \nThe Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement with Epic Pharma LLC, dated June 4, 2015 (the 2015 Epic License Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company entered into a Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC dated August 24, 2016 (the SunGen Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs to acquire intangible assets; if such assets are determined to have a finite useful life they are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Costs to acquire indefinite lived intangible assets, such as costs related to ANDAs are capitalized accordingly.\nThe Company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of March 31st) and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others and without limitation: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate of the Company's segments; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates.\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.\n 69 \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be realizable in the future.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. These tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The cost of the stock-based payments to nonemployees that are fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at that date, unless there is a contractual term for services in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.\nIn accordance with the Company's Director compensation policy and certain employment contracts, director's fees and a portion of employee's salaries are to be paid via the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash, with the valuation of such share being calculated on a quarterly basis and equal to the simple average closing price of the Company's common stock.\nWarrants and Preferred Shares\nThe accounting treatment of warrants and preferred share series issued is determined pursuant to the guidance provided by ASC 470, Debt, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as applicable. Each feature of a freestanding financial instruments including, without limitation, any rights relating to subsequent dilutive issuances, dividend issuances, equity sales, rights offerings, forced conversions, optional redemptions, automatic monthly conversions, dividends and exercise are assessed with determinations made regarding the proper classification in the Company's financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-3\u201d). ASU 2015-3 revises previous guidance to require that debt issuance costs be reported in the audited consolidated financial statements as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the amendments, debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred charge (i.e. an asset) on the audited consolidated financial statements. This new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2015, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The amendments must be applied retrospectively. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03. Refer to Note 2 Change in Accounting Principle for the effect of adopting ASU 2015-03 on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendments in this update deferred the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim reporting periods within that period. Topic 606 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 and related ASUs noted below on its audited consolidated financial statements.\n 70 \nFrom March through December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2015-14.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-11 clarify the determination of net realizable value of inventory, applicable to measurement of inventory asset value on the balance sheet. The amendments do not change the core principal of the guidance provided in Topic 330, specifically the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market value, with market value being determined by the net realizable value of the inventory item(s). The amendments clarify, however, that net realizable value is to be measured as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-02 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-09 provide revised guidance in relation to the following with regards to share based payments: i) Accounting for forfeitures, ii) Income tax effects, and iii) classification of excess tax benefits. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero-coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-15 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement cash flows. The new standard is expected to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-18 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d (ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a set\u201d), is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\n 71 \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment\u201d (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and an entity should apply the amendments of ASU 2017-04 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting\u201d (ASU 2017-09). ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces both (i) diversity in practice and (ii) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all three of the following are met: (1) The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement is used) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. If the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification. (2) The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. (3) The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. Note that the current disclosure requirements in Topic 718 apply regardless of whether an entity is required to apply modification accounting under the amendments in ASU 2017-09. ASU 2017-09 is effective for all annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, is intended to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nBackground\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products, using proprietary know-how and technology, particularly as it relates to abuse resistant products.\nWe occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ. The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP\u201d) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA\u201d) registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing.\nStrategy\nWe focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) development of our pain management products; (ii) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Application's ( ANDAs\u201d); (iii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iv) development of the other products in our pipeline including the products with our partners; (v) commercial exploitation of our products either by license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (vi) development of new products and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.\nOur focus is on the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require new drug applications ( NDAs\u201d) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Drug Price Competition Act\u201d) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.\n 57 \nWe believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.\nProduct Development Activities\nIn January 2016, we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOxTM, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, we received notification of the FDA's acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA\u201d) of July 14, 2016. On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOxTM NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form. On December 21, 2016, we met with the FDA for an end-of-review meeting to discuss steps that we could take to obtain approval of SequestOxTM. Based on the FDA response, we believe that there is a clear path forward to address the issues cited in the CRL. We believe that the meeting minutes, received from the FDA on January 23, 2017, supported a plan to address the issues cited by the FDA in the CRL by modifying the SequestOxTM formulation. Such plan includes, without limitation, conducting bioequivalence and bioavailability fed and fasted studies, comparing the modified formulation to the original formulation. The fed study is in progress. The Company plans on initiating the fasted study after successful completion of the fed study. Resubmission of the SequestOxTM application requires successful completion of all required studies, including these fed and fasted studies. Please note, however, that there can be no assurances that our intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if we receive marketing approval, there can be no assurances of future revenues or profits relating to this product, or that any such future revenues and profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.\nOn August 9, 2016, we filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Percocet\u00ae (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen, USP CII) 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg tablets with 325mg of acetaminophen. Percocet\u00ae is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to severe pain. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nOn December 12, 2016, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Norco\u00ae (hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets USP CII) 2.5mg/325mg, 5mg/325mg, 7.5mg/325mg and 10mg/325mg tablets. Norco is a combination medication and is used to help relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. The combination products of hydrocodone and acetaminophen have total annual US sales of approximately $700 million, according to IMS Health Data. The Company has not received a response from the FDA regarding this ANDA filing.\nThere can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization within this time period, or at all. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.\nOn March 22, 2017, European Patent No. 1615623 titled Abuse-Resistant Oral Dosage Forms and Method of Use Thereof\u201d was issued. This patent expands the intellectual property for the Company's opioid abuse deterrent technology. Elite now has four US patents, one European patent, and two Canadian patents issued in this area with additional patents pending in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\n 58 \nResults of Operations:\nYears Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue, Cost of revenue and Gross profit:\n\nTotal revenues for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $2.9 million or 23%, to $9.6 million, as compared to $12.5 million, for the corresponding year.\nManufacturing fees decreased by $0.7 million, or 8%, due to decrease in generic Methadone, Hydromorphone and Phentermine sales, partially offset by increases in generic Naltrexone sales.\nLicensing fees decreased by $2.2 million, or 49%. This decrease is primarily due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of a New Drug Application for SequestOxTM. This milestone payment was offset by increases in license fees from generic sales licensed to TAGI and Epic.\nCosts of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of revenue increased by $1.4 million or 32%, to $5.9 million as compared to $4.5 million for the corresponding period. The increase in costs of revenue is primarily due to increased and continued investments in Company's facility and resources, and increased regulatory costs, leading to higher overhead absorption rates.\nOur gross profit margin was 39% during the year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin is due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOxTM, which resulted in a greater gross profit margin in the prior year, as compared to the current year, combined with a product mix consisting of lower margin products and higher overhead absorption rates in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses:\n\nOperating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $5.2 million, or 32%, to $11.1 million, as compared to $16.3 million for the prior year.\nResearch and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $8.3 million, a decrease of $4.1 million or 33% from $12.4 million of such costs for the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing and composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products in addition to a focus on clinical trials for generic products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2017 were $2.1 million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 28% from $2.9 million of such costs for the prior year. The decrease was due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives focused on an actual and proportionate reduction of general and administrative expenses, as compared to commercial and product development activities and achieving an operating expense profile with an increased direct correlation to these commercial and product development activities.\n 59 \nNon-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.36 million, an increase of $0.03 million or 7% from $0.33 million of such costs for the prior year. Non-cash compensation expense derives from the timing in amortization of the value of employee stock options issued over the course of the last three years.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 47% from $0.7 million of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was due to the combination of increased facility utilization and higher depreciation absorption rates currently as a result of facility expansion and improvements over the last year.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.4 million, compared to a loss from operations of $8.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016.\nOther income (expense):\n\nOther income (expense), net for the year ended March 31, 2017 was net other income of $9.3 million, an increase in net other income of $2.2 million from the net other income of $7.1 million for the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in other income was due to the change in the fair value of our outstanding warrants (derivative instruments) during the year ended March 31, 2017 totaling other income of $9.5 million, as compared to $7.4 million for the prior year. Please note that the change in fair value of derivative instruments is determined in large part by the number of warrants outstanding and the change in the closing price of our Common Stock as of the end of the year, as compared to the closing price at the beginning of the year, with a strong inverse relationship between derivative revenues and increases in the closing price of our Common Stock.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net income from operations before the net benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $1.9 million, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the prior year.\nNet benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of Elite, received final approval from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for the sale of net tax benefits. The Company sold the net tax benefits approved for total proceeds of $1,870,114.\nChange in value of Series I convertible preferred stock:\nChanges in the value in our Series I convertible preferred stock, which is included in the calculation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders resulted in an increase in net income of $20.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, as compared to an increase in net loss of $9.3 million for the prior year. Accordingly, net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended March 31, 2017 was a net income of $24.5 million, compared to a net loss of $10.0 million for the prior year.\n 60 \nYears Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015\nRevenue, Cost of revenue and Gross profit:\n\nTotal revenues for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased by $7.5 million, or 149%, to $12.5 million, as compared to $5.0 million, for the corresponding year due to continued growth in the Company's generic product lines.\nManufacturing fees increased by $4.1 million, or 107%, due to continued growth in the Company's generic product sales.\nLicensing fees increased by $3.4 million, or 294%. This increase is due to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOxTM in addition to increased profit splits from product sales relating to TAGI and Epic.\nCosts of revenue consists of manufacturing and assembly costs. Our costs of revenue increased by $1.5 million or 49%, to $4.5 million, as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is due to the increase in manufacturing volumes.\nOur gross profit margin was 64% during the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to 40% during the year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is due in large part to the Company earning a one-time, non-refundable $2.5 million milestone in January 2016 related to the filing of an NDA for SequestOxTM.\nOperating expenses:\n\nOperating expenses consist of research and development costs, general and administrative, non-cash compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased by $2.2 million, or 12%, to $16.3 million, as compared to $18.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nResearch and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 were $12.4 million, a decrease of $2.3 million or 16% from $14.7 million of such costs for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was due to the timing and composition of ongoing development of our abuse deterrent opioid and other products.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2.9 million. We have continued to increase the utilization of our manufacturing facilities resulting in lower unallocated overheads.\n 61 \nNon-cash compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.33 million, an increase of $0.07 million, or approximately 28% from $0.26 million for the comparable period of the prior year. The increase was due to the issuance of options to purchase an aggregate of 4,334,000 shares of Common Stock to various employees during the year ended March 31, 2016, primarily pursuant to employment agreements, and the timing of the amortization schedule established at the time of issuance of the related stock options\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $0.67 million, an increase of $0.05 million, or 8% from $0.62 million of such costs for the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the expansion and upgrading of the Northvale Facility, which has required substantial investments in property, plant and equipment.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our loss from operations for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $8.3 million, compared to a loss from operations of $16.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nOther income (expense):\n\nOther income for the year ended March 31, 2016 totaled a net other income of $7.1 million, a decrease in net other income of $14.6 million from the net other income of $21.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was due to the change in the fair value of our outstanding warrants (derivative instruments) during the year ended March 31, 2016 totaling $7.4 million, as compared to a net derivative income of $20.3 million and gain on sale of investment totaling $1.7 for the year ended March 31, 2015, a $14.6 million overall decrease in other income. Please note that the change in fair value of derivative instruments is determined in large part by the number of warrants outstanding and the change in the closing price of our Common Stock as of the end of the year, as compared to the closing price at the beginning of the year, with a strong inverse relationship between derivative revenues and increases in the closing price of our Common Stock.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net loss from operations before the net benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits for the year ended March 31, 2016, including credits for income taxes totaling $0.5 million was $1.2 million, compared to a net income of $5.2 million, inclusive of credit for income taxes totaling $0.003 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\nNet benefit from sale of state net operating loss credits\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of Elite, received final approval from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for the sale of net tax benefits. The Company sold the net tax benefits approved for total proceeds of $520,452.\nChange in value of Series I convertible preferred stock:\nChanges in the value in our Series I convertible preferred stock, which is included in the calculation of net loss attributable to common shareholders resulted in the net loss being increased by $9.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2016, as compared to an increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of $23.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. Accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders for the year ended March 31, 2016 was net loss of $10.0 million, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $28.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.\n 62 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\n\nThe Company considers cash and working capital balances as several of the factors the Company uses in evaluating its performance, without limitation. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash on hand of $10.6 million and a working capital surplus of $15.1 million. The Company believes that such resources, combined with the Company's access to the new equity line with Lincoln Park Capital (see below), are sufficient to fund operations through the current operating cycle. For the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company had losses from operations totaling $7.4 million, net other income totaling $9.3 million and net income of $3.8 million. In addition, changes in the carrying value of preferred share mezzanine equity for the year ended March 31, 2017 were an increase of $20.7 million, with such amount being charged to net income available to common shareholders. Please note that the Company's other income/(expenses) and net income available to common shareholders are significantly influenced by the fluctuations in the fair value of outstanding preferred share and warrant derivatives, and that such fair values bear a strong, inverse correlation to the market share price of the Company's Common Stock.\nOur working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities) increased by $3.0 million from $12.1 million as of March 31, 2016 to $15.1 million as of March 31, 2017, with such increase being primarily related to capital financings that included $7.6 million in proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the 2014 Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and $1.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and options, offset in large part by purchases of fixed assets and leasehold improvements totaling $1.1 million and payment on principal of $0.2 million in NJEDA Bonds and other loans. Please note that capital financings provide cash to the Company without a corresponding current liability and accordingly have an accretive effect on working capital.\nThe Company does not anticipate being profitable for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, due in large part to its plans to conduct clinical development and commercialization activities on a range of abuse deterrent opioid products, on an accelerated and simultaneous basis. Such activities require the investment of significant amounts in clinical trials, safety and efficacy studies, bioequivalence studies, product manufacturing, regulatory expertise and filings, as well as investments in manufacturing and lab equipment and software. In order to finance these significant expenditures, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, with such agreement providing the Company with an equity line totaling $40 million. We believe this amount of financing, if received, is sufficient to fund the commercialization of the abuse deterrent opioid products identified. Please see below for further details on the financing transactions with Lincoln Park.\nIn addition, the Company had previously received Notices of Default from the Trustee of the NJEDA Bonds as a result of the utilization of the debt service reserve being used to pay interest payments as well as the company's failure to make scheduled principal payments. All monetary defaults have been cured during Fiscal 2015 and the Company is current on all NJEDA Bond interest and principal payments. See NJEDA Bonds\u201d below and the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled A notice of default was issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in relation to prior obligations of our tax-exempt bonds. Although we are current in our payments under these bonds, If the principal balances due under these bonds are accelerated pursuant to the notice of default, our ability to operate in the future will be materially and adversely affected\u201d.\nSummary of Cash Flows:\n\n 63 \nYear Ended March 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $7.9 million, which included net income of $3.8 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million. The changes in the balance of assets and liabilities include a decrease in account receivables totaling $0.6 million which resulted in a net increase in cash, offset by an increase in inventories of $3.1 million and decreases in deferred revenues of $1.0 million, accounts payables, other current liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.0 million, each of which result in a net decrease in cash. These instances of decreases in cash are offset by change in non-cash compensation accrued of $0.4 million, non-cash change in fair value of derivative financial instruments - warrants of $9.5 million, and non-cash compensation from the issuance of common stock of $0.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $1.1 million, which primarily was for the purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $8.1 million. This consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to Lincoln Park Capital of $7.6 million, proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and option exercises of $1.9 million; offset by $1.3 million in bond and loan principal payments, including repayment of a related party line of credit of $0.7 million.\nOverall, as a result of the foregoing, the Company had a net decrease in cash of $0.9 million during Fiscal 2017.\nYear Ended March 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $2.8 million, which included a net loss of $0.7 million. This decrease in cash is offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.9 million. The changes in the balance of assets and liabilities include a decrease in account receivables and prepaid expenses totaling $0.2 million, and an increase in deferred revenues of $4.2 million, each of which result in a net increase in cash, offset by increases in inventories of $0.3 million and decreases in accounts payables and other current liabilities of $2.2 million, each of which result in a net decrease in cash. In addition, there was a non-cash change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments - warrants of $7.4 million, change in non-cash compensation accrued of $0.6 million, and non-cash compensation from the issuance of common stock of $0.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $1.9 million, which primarily was for the purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $8.8 million. This consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to Lincoln Park Capital of $6.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and options exercises of $3.0 million; offset by $0.4 million in bond and loan principal payments.\nOverall, as a result of the foregoing, the Company had a net increase in cash of $4 million during Fiscal 2016.\nYear Ended March 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 was $15.1 million, which included net income of $5.2 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. The changes in the balance of assets and liabilities include an increase in account receivables, inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets totaling $2.0 million, and offset by an increase in deferred revenues and customer deposits of $1.2 million. These instances of decreases in cash are offset by change in non-cash compensation accrued of $0.7 million, non-cash change in fair value of derivative financial instruments - warrants of $20.3 million, non-cash compensation from the issuance of common stock of $0.3 million and gain on sale of investment of $1.7 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 was $2.9 million. This consisted in $2.0 million of cash expenditures related to purchases of property and equipment, offset by $5.0 million from proceeds related to the sale of investment in Novel.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 was $12.7 million. This consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to Lincoln Park Capital of $13.2 million, proceeds from the exercise of cash warrants and option exercises of $0.8 million; offset by $0.2 million in other loan principal payments and $1.1 million related to payment of NJEDA bonds.\nOverall, as a result of the foregoing, the Company had a net increase in cash of $0.5 million during Fiscal 2015.\nLincoln Park Capital\nOn April 10, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Lincoln Park (the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park had agreed to purchase from us up to $40 million of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over a 36-month period.\nUpon execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 1,928,641 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as consideration for its commitment to purchase additional shares of our common stock under that agreement and were obligated to issue up to an additional 1,928,641 commitment shares to Lincoln Park pro rata as up to $40 million of our common stock is purchased by Lincoln Park.\nThe 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement expired on June 1, 2017. During the term of the 2014 LPC Purchase Agreement, we sold an aggregate of 110.6 million shares to Lincoln Park, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $27.0 million. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 3.2 million commitment shares.\nOn May 1, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d), together with a registration rights agreement (the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement\u201d), with Lincoln Park.\n 64 \nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $40 million in shares of our common stock ( Common Stock\u201d), subject to certain limitations, from time to time, over the 36-month period commencing on June 5, 2017. We may direct Lincoln Park, at our sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock on any business day, provided that at least one business day has passed since the most recent purchase, increasing to up to 1,000,000 shares, depending upon the closing sale price of the Common Stock (such purchases, Regular Purchases\u201d). However, in no event shall a Regular Purchase be more than $1,000,000. The purchase price of shares of Common Stock related to the future funding will be based on the prevailing market prices of such shares at the time of sales. In addition, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases under certain circumstances. Our sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement are limited to no more than the number of shares that would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates, at any single point in time, of more than 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.\nIn connection with the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued to Lincoln Park 5,540,550 shares of Common Stock and we are required to issue up to 5,540,550 additional shares of Common Stock pro rata as we require Lincoln Park to purchase our shares under the Purchase Agreement over the term of the agreement. Lincoln Park has represented to us, among other things, that it is an accredited investor\u201d (as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d)). We sold the securities in reliance upon an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The securities sold may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nThe 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement and the 2017 LPC Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for us and our operations. There are no trading volume requirements or, other than the limitation on beneficial ownership discussed above, restrictions under the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has covenanted not to cause or engage in any manner whatsoever, any direct or indirect short selling or hedging of our shares.\nThe net proceeds received by us under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our stock to Lincoln Park. We anticipate that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park under the 2017 LPC Purchase Agreement will be used for research and product development, general corporate purposes and working capital requirements.\nA registration statement on form S-3 was filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 and was declared effective on June 5, 2017.\nHakim $1,000,000 Bridge Revolving Credit Line\nOn October 15, 2013 (the Hakim Credit Line Effective Date\u201d), and as amended on January 4, 2015, we entered into a bridge loan agreement (the Hakim Loan Agreement\u201d) with Nasrat Hakim, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and CEO. Under the terms of the Hakim Loan Agreement, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to a line of credit ( Hakim Credit Line\u201d) in the maximum principal amount of up to $1,000,000 at any one time. Mr. Hakim provided the Credit Line for the purpose of supporting the acceleration of our product development activities. The outstanding amount matured on March 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the Hakim Credit Line bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. As of March 31, 2016, the principal balance owed under the Credit Line was $718k with an additional $71k in accrued interest being also owed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Line. The entire principal amount due under the Hakim Credit Line, which expired on March 31, 2016, was paid on May 24, 2016. An additional $9k in interest, accrued at an annual rate of 10%, was incurred on the principal balance outstanding during the period beginning on April 1, 2016 and ending on May 24, 2016, the date on which the principal balance was paid. All interest amounts owed in relation to principal balances outstanding on the Hakim Credit Line and consisting of interest amounts due and owing as of March 31, 2016 and interest amounts incurred subsequent to March 31, 2016 and up to the date of principal repayment, were paid on May 24, 2016.\n 65 \nConvertible Note Payable to Mikah Pharma LLC\nOn August 1, 2013, Elite Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, executed an asset purchase agreement (the Mikah Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Mikah Pharma LLC ( Mikah\u201d), an entity that is wholly owned by Mr. Nasrat Hakim, who, in conjunction with this transaction, was appointed as Elite's CEO, President and a Director on August 2, 2012, and acquired from Mikah a total of 13 Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs\u201d) consisting of 12 ANDAs approved by the FDA and one ANDA under active review with the FDA, and all amendments thereto (the Acquisition\u201d) for aggregate consideration of $10,000,000, inclusive of imputed interest payable pursuant to a non-interest bearing, secured convertible note due in August 2016 (the Mikah Note\u201d). Please see Thirteen Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( ANDAs\u201d)\u201d in Part I, Item 1 Business, above for more information on the Acquisition. The Mikah Note was amended on February 7, 2014 to make it convertible into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Mikah Note, as amended, was interest free and due and payable on the third anniversary of its issuance. Subject to certain limitations, the principal amount of the Mikah Note was convertible at the option of Mikah into shares of Common Stock at a rate of $0.07 (approximately 14,286 shares per $1,000 in principal amount), the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date that the asset purchase agreement and Note were executed and/or into shares of the Company's Series I Convertible Preferred Stock at the rate of 1 share of Series I Preferred Stock for each $100,000 of principal owed on the Mikah Note. The conversion rate was adjustable for customary corporate actions such as stock splits and, subject to certain exclusions, includes weighted average anti-dilution for common stock transactions at prices below the then applicable conversion rate. Pursuant to a security agreement (the Security Agreement\u201d), repayment of the Mikah Note was secured by the ANDAs acquired in the Acquisition.\nOn February 7, 2014, Mikah converted the principal amount of $10,000,000, representing the entire principal balance due under the Mikah Note, into 100 shares of the Company's Series I Preferred Stock, and was retired.\nNJEDA Bonds\nOn August 31, 2005, the Company successfully completed a refinancing of a prior 1999 bond issue through the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds (the Bonds\u201d). The refinancing involved borrowing $4,155,000, evidenced by a 6.5% Series A Note in the principal amount of $3,660,000 maturing on September 1, 2030 and a 9% Series B Note in the principal amount of $495,000 maturing on September 1, 2012. The net proceeds, after payment of issuance costs, were used (i) to redeem the outstanding tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority on September 2, 1999, (ii) refinance other equipment financing and (iii) for the purchase of certain equipment to be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. As of March 31, 2016, all of the proceeds were utilized by the Company for such stated purposes.\nInterest is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The Bonds are collateralized by a first lien on the Company's facility and equipment acquired with the proceeds of the original and refinanced Bonds. The related Indenture requires the maintenance of a Debt Service Reserve Fund of $366,000 in relation to the Series A Notes.\nBond issue costs of $354,000 were paid from the bond proceeds and are being amortized over the life of the bonds. Amortization of bond issuance costs amounted to $14,179 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\n 66 \nThe NJEDA Bonds require the Company to make an annual principal payment on September 1st of varying amounts as specified in the loan documents and semi-annual interest payments on March 1st and September 1st, equal to interest due on the outstanding principal at the applicable rate for the semi-annual period just ended.\nAs of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no interest or principal amounts in arrears. The Series B Notes were retired, at par in July 2014.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our enforceable and legally binding non-cancellable obligations as of March 31, 2017:\n\n 1 Consists of lease payments pursuant to the operating lease for 135 Ludlow Ave for a period, exclusive of taxes and insurance, expiring on December 31, 2021. The lease also includes an additional five-year option, exercised at the sole discretion of the Company and at fixed rates, which are defined in the lease. Due to the relevance to the Company's operations, of the facility at 135 Ludlow Avenue, the Company expects to exercise the first five-year option. If such option were to be exercised, a new contractual obligation would be created, with payments totaling $1.2 million, exclusive of real estate taxes and insurance, over the full five-year term of the option period. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe are subject to price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the products that we sell. Management does not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCybersecurity\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company had no reportable incidents of cybersecurity.\n 67 \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company enters into licensing, manufacturing and development agreements, which may include multiple revenue generating activities, including, without limitation, milestones, licensing fees, product sales and services. These multiple elements are assessed in accordance with ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Element Arrangements in order to determine whether particular components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting.\nAn arrangement component is considered to be a separate unit of accounting if the deliverable relating to the component has value to the customer on a standalone basis, and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in control of the Company.\nThe Company recognizes payments received pursuant to a multiple revenue agreement as revenue, only if the related delivered item(s) have stand-alone value, with the arrangement being accordingly accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. If such delivered item(s) are considered to either not have stand-alone value, the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting, and the payments received are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when performance obligations relating to the item(s) will be performed.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, it determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. If it cannot reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete its performance obligations under a multiple-element arrangement, revenues are then recognized on a straight-line basis over the period encompassing the expected completion of such obligations, with such period being reassessed at each subsequent reporting period.\nArrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price (the relative selling price method). When applying the relative selling price method, the selling price of each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if such exists; otherwise, third-part evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method. In deciding whether we can determine vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, the Company does not ignore information that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort.\nWhen determining the selling price for significant deliverables under a multiple-element revenue arrangement, the Company considers any or all of the following, without limitation, depending on information available or information that could be reasonably available without undue cost and effort: vendor-specific objective evidence, third party evidence or best estimate of selling price. More specifically, factors considered can include, without limitation and as appropriate, size of market for a specific product, number of suppliers and other competitive market factors, forecast market shares and gross profits, barriers/time frames to market entry/launch, intellectual property rights and protections, exclusive or non-exclusive arrangements, costs of similar/identical deliverables from third parties, contractual terms, including, without limitation, length of contract, renewal rights, commercial terms, profit allocations, and other commercial, financial, tangible and intangible factors that may be relevant in the valuation of a specific deliverable.\n 68 \nMilestone payments are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-28, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method for any deliverables or units of accounting under which the Company must achieve a defined performance obligation which is contingent upon future events or circumstances that are uncertain as of the inception of the arrangement providing for such future milestone payment. Determination of the substantiveness of a milestone is a matter of subjective assessment performed at the inception of the arrangement, and with consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meeting all of the following:\n \u00b7 It must be either commensurate with the Company's performance in achieving the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company's performance to achieve the milestone; and \n \u00b7 It relates solely to past performance; and \n \u00b7 It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement. \nCollaborative Arrangements\nContracts are considered to be collaborative arrangements when they satisfy the following criteria defined in ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements:\n \u00b7 The parties to the contract must actively participate in the joint operating activity; and \n \u00b7 The joint operating activity must expose the parties to the possibility of significant risk and rewards, based on whether or not the activity is successful. \nThe Company entered into a sales and distribution licensing agreement with Epic Pharma LLC, dated June 4, 2015 (the 2015 Epic License Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company entered into a Master Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC dated August 24, 2016 (the SunGen Agreement\u201d), which has been determined to satisfy the criteria for consideration as a collaborative agreement, and is accounted for accordingly, in accordance with GAAP.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. In determining collectability, historical trends are evaluated and specific customer issues are reviewed on a periodic basis to arrive at appropriate allowances.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs to acquire intangible assets; if such assets are determined to have a finite useful life they are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Costs to acquire indefinite lived intangible assets, such as costs related to ANDAs are capitalized accordingly.\nThe Company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of March 31st) and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others and without limitation: a significant decline in the Company's expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate of the Company's segments; unanticipated competition; and slower growth rates.\nAs of March 31, 2017, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.\n 69 \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Where applicable, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets that it determines will not be realizable in the future.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of an uncertain tax position that it has taken or expects to take on income tax returns it files if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. These tax benefits are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the terms of the awards. The cost of the stock-based payments to nonemployees that are fully vested and non-forfeitable as at the grant date is measured and recognized at that date, unless there is a contractual term for services in which case such compensation would be amortized over the contractual term.\nIn accordance with the Company's Director compensation policy and certain employment contracts, director's fees and a portion of employee's salaries are to be paid via the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash, with the valuation of such share being calculated on a quarterly basis and equal to the simple average closing price of the Company's common stock.\nWarrants and Preferred Shares\nThe accounting treatment of warrants and preferred share series issued is determined pursuant to the guidance provided by ASC 470, Debt, ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as applicable. Each feature of a freestanding financial instruments including, without limitation, any rights relating to subsequent dilutive issuances, dividend issuances, equity sales, rights offerings, forced conversions, optional redemptions, automatic monthly conversions, dividends and exercise are assessed with determinations made regarding the proper classification in the Company's financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-3\u201d). ASU 2015-3 revises previous guidance to require that debt issuance costs be reported in the audited consolidated financial statements as a direct deduction from the face amount of the related liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the amendments, debt issuance costs were presented as a deferred charge (i.e. an asset) on the audited consolidated financial statements. This new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2015, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The amendments must be applied retrospectively. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03. Refer to Note 2 Change in Accounting Principle for the effect of adopting ASU 2015-03 on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendments in this update deferred the effective date for implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year and is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim reporting periods within that period. Topic 606 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 and related ASUs noted below on its audited consolidated financial statements.\n 70 \nFrom March through December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2015-14.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ( ASU 2015-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2015-11 clarify the determination of net realizable value of inventory, applicable to measurement of inventory asset value on the balance sheet. The amendments do not change the core principal of the guidance provided in Topic 330, specifically the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market value, with market value being determined by the net realizable value of the inventory item(s). The amendments clarify, however, that net realizable value is to be measured as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-02 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-09\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-09 provide revised guidance in relation to the following with regards to share based payments: i) Accounting for forfeitures, ii) Income tax effects, and iii) classification of excess tax benefits. The guidance is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption being optional and permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15\u201d). ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero-coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification, including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing activities. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-15 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement cash flows. The new standard is expected to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-18 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business\u201d (ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a set\u201d), is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-01 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\n 71 \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment\u201d (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and an entity should apply the amendments of ASU 2017-04 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-04 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No 2017-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting\u201d (ASU 2017-09). ASU 2017-09 provides clarity and reduces both (i) diversity in practice and (ii) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all three of the following are met: (1) The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement is used) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. If the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification. (2) The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. (3) The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. Note that the current disclosure requirements in Topic 718 apply regardless of whether an entity is required to apply modification accounting under the amendments in ASU 2017-09. ASU 2017-09 is effective for all annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2017-09 on its audited consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not
