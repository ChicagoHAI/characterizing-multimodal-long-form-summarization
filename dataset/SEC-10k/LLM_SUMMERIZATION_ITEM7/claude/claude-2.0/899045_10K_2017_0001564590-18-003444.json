This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company's net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company's ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, which affect the rates the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays.\nHistorically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Cash,\u201d for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately $297.3 million. See Uses of Cash-Acquisitions,\u201d for more information.\nThe Company's business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the past three years:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard - Traditional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard - Digital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PP&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to approximate our 2017 spending.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and acquisition-adjusted net revenue.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets and investments.\nFFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate non-controlling interest.\nWe define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) non-cash tax expense (benefit); (iv) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (v) amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (viii) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (ix) an adjustment for non-controlling interest.\nAcquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as acquisition net revenue\u201d. In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period.\nAdjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as depreciation and amortization may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period over period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (4) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct advertising expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.2 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of Lamar Media's senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.7 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $317.7 million, as compared to net income of $298.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,525,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 317,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,664\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,961\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 671,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.4 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.3 million as compared to $488.9 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.0 million to $439.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.0 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.5 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $298.8 million, as compared to net income of $262.6 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by\nadding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,353,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,457,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,765\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,330\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 591,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.5 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 10.6% to $488.9 million as compared to $442.1 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, corporate expenses and interest expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nThe Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the principal borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media.\nSources of Cash\nTotal Liquidity at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately $354.6 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $115.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $239.1 million of availability under the revolving portion of Lamar Media's senior credit facility. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility, and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility.\nCash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 our cash provided by operating activities was $507.0 million, $521.8 million and $477.7 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the same period in 2016 relates to an increase in revenues offset by increases in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities. We generated cash flows from operations during 2017 in excess of our cash needs for operations and capital expenditures as described herein. We used the excess cash generated principally to pay dividends and fund our acquisitions. See - Cash Flows\u201d for more information.\nCredit Facilities. On May 15, 2017, Lamar Media entered into a Third Restatement Agreement ( Restatement Agreement\u201d) with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media's existing senior credit facility. The Restatement Agreement amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 3, 2014, as amended, which consisted of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a $300.0 million Term A loan facility. On January 7, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Incremental Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2014 with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as\nadministrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Incremental Amendment established a $300.0 million Term A-1 loan as a new class of incremental term loan. Lamar Media borrowed the $300.0 million in Term A-1 loans on January 7, 2016. The Term A-1 loan was repaid in full with the proceeds of an intuitional private placement of senior notes on January 28, 2016.\nLamar Media's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (as amended, the senior credit facility\u201d) consists of (i) a new $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which will mature on May 15, 2022, (ii) a new $450.0 million Term A loan facility (the Term A loans\u201d) which will mature on May 15, 2022, and (iii) an incremental facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to pro forma compliance with the secured debt ratio financial maintenance covenant described under Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility.\u201d\nUnder the senior credit facility Lamar Media borrowed all $450.0 million in Term A loans on May 15, 2017. The net proceeds, together with borrowing under the revolving portion of senior credit facility and cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the existing senior credit facility, and all revolving commitments under that facility were terminated.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior credit facility was $636.8 million, consisting of $438.8 million outstanding in Term A loans and $198.0 million of revolving credit loans. In addition, Lamar Media had approximately $239.1 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility included in the senior credit facility.\nNote Offerings. On January 28, 2016, Lamar Media completed an institutional private placement of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026. The institutional private placement resulted in net proceeds to Lamar Media, after payment of fees and expenses of approximately $394.5 million. Lamar Media used the proceeds of this offering to repay the $300.0 million Term A-1 loan, which it borrowed on January 7, 2016 in order to fund the acquisition of certain assets of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., and a portion of the borrowing outstanding under its revolving credit facility. On September 1, 2016, Lamar Media completed an exchange offer for all of its then outstanding 5 3/4% Senior Notes, which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an equal principal amount of newly issued 5 3/4% Senior Notes that were so registered. Lamar Media did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer.\nFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\nInternally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers.\nCredit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the senior credit facility and its outstanding debt securities.\nRestrictions Under Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to its outstanding debt securities. Currently Lamar Media has outstanding $500 million 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in February 2012 (the 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $535 million 5% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2012 (the 5% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $510 million 5 3/8% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 (the 5 3/8% Senior Notes\u201d) and the $400 million 5 3/4% Senior Notes issued in January 2016 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). On February 16, 2018, we announced that we intend to redeem all $500.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes on March 19, 2018.\nThe indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media's restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision.\nIn addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> up to $1.5 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> certain purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations to acquire or lease property in the ordinary course of business that cannot exceed the greater of $50 million or 5% of Lamar Media's net tangible assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> additional debt not to exceed $75 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestrictions under Senior Credit Facility. Lamar Media is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions under the senior credit facility. If the Company or Lamar Media fails to comply with these tests, the lenders under the senior credit facility will be entitled to exercise certain remedies, including the termination of the lending commitments and the acceleration of the debt payments under the senior credit facility. At December 31, 2017, and currently, we were in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility.\nLamar Media must maintain a secured debt ratio, defined as total consolidated secured debt of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries, minus the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness subject to exceptions, one of which is that it may incur additional indebtedness not exceeding the greater of $250.0 million and 6% of its total assets.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional unsecured senior indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its senior debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (excluding subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended is less than 4.5 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional subordinated indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (including subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended, is less than 6.5 to 1.0.\nUnder the senior credit facility, EBITDA\u201d means, for any period, operating income for Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis without duplication in accordance with GAAP) for such period (calculated (A) before (i) taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) any other non-cash income or charges accrued for such period, (vi) charges and expenses in connection with the senior credit facility, any actual or proposed acquisition, disposition or investment (excluding, in each case, purchases and sales of advertising space and operating assets in the ordinary course of business) and any actual or proposed offering of securities, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness (or amendment to any agreement relating to indebtedness), including any refinancing thereof, or recapitalization and (vii) any loss or gain relating to amounts paid or earned in cash prior to the stated settlement date of any swap agreement that has been reflected in operating income for such period) and (B) after giving effect to the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies projected by Lamar Media in good faith to be realized as a result of any acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition within 18 months of any such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such action; provided, (a) the aggregate amount for all such cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies will not exceed an amount equal to 15% of EBITDA for the applicable four quarter period and (b) any such adjustment to EBITDA may only take into account cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies that are (I) directly attributable to such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, (II) expected to have a continuing impact on Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries and (III) factually supportable, in each case all as certified by the chief financial officer of Lamar Media) on behalf of Lamar Media, and excluding (except to the extent received or paid in cash by Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its restricted subsidiaries income or loss attributable to equity in affiliates for such period), excluding any extraordinary and unusual gains or losses during such period, and excluding the proceeds of any casualty events and dispositions. For purposes hereof, the effect thereon of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R shall be excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, Lamar Media has consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA will be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period.\nThe Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs through fiscal 2018. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company's balance sheet.\nUses of Cash\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We anticipate our 2018 total capital expenditures will closely approximate our 2017 spending.\nAcquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed approximately 50 acquisitions for a cash purchase price of $297.3 million, which included the acquisition of more than 2,700 billboard displays across various markets. The acquisitions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2017 were financed using available cash on hand or borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nStock Repurchase Program. On December 11, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's Class A common stock. There were no repurchases under the repurchase program and the repurchase program expired on June 30, 2016.\nNote Redemption. On February 16, 2018, Lamar Media announced its intent to redeem in full all $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes. The redemption will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes and terms of the notice of redemption. Lamar Media expects the notes to be redeemed on March 19, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 101.958% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to (but not including) the redemption date. Lamar intends to fund the redemption through borrowings from the establishment of a new term loan facility under Lamar Media's senior credit facility. See Sources of Cash-Credit Facility for more information.\nTerm A Loans. The Term A loans mature on May 15, 2022 and began amortizing on September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining quarterly installments scheduled to be paid on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 are as follows:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Principal Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal Amount\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018-June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,625.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2019-June 30, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,437.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2020-March 31, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,875.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term A Loan Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor each borrowing of Term A loans or revolving credit loans, Lamar Media can elect whether such loans bear interest at (i) the Adjusted Base Rate plus (a) 0.75%, or (b) 0.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus (a) 1.75%, or (b) 1.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements. The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A loans and revolving credit facility.\nDividends. On February 22, 2018, Lamar Advertising Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.91 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on March 19, 2018. The Company expects aggregate quarterly distributions to stockholders in 2018, including the dividend payable on March 29, 2018 (but excluding the dividend paid on January 2, 2018, described below), will total $3.65 per common share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared distributions of $325.5 million or $3.32 per share of common stock, including paid distributions of $243.9 million or $2.49 per share of common stock. On January 2, 2018, the Company paid its quarterly distribution declared on November 28, 2017 of $0.83 per share to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on December 18, 2017, for approximately $81.5 million.\nThe Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company's control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on\ndistributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company's ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company's distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nDebt Service and Contractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.56 billion. In the future, Lamar Media has principal reduction obligations and revolver commitment reductions under the senior credit facility. In addition, it has fixed commercial commitments. These commitments are detailed as follows:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,556.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,027.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,443.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations on long term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 739.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard site and other operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 305.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 236.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 809.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total payments due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,845.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 642.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,490.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,363.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Interest rates on our variable rate instruments are assuming rates at the December 2017 levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Expiration Per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Amount\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Bank Facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby Letters of Credit(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Lamar Media had $198.0 million outstanding under the revolving facility at December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> The standby letters of credit are issued under Lamar Media's revolving credit facility and reduce the availability of the facility by the same amount.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nThe Company's cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in revenues of approximately $41.0 million, offset by an increase of interest expense of approximately $4.7 million, an increase of operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) of approximately $27.0 million and an increase in operating net assets of $29.0 million, as compared to the comparable period in 2016.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $280.9 million from $681.0 million in 2016 to $400.1 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in acquisition activity of $287.7 million as compared to the same period in 2016.\nThe Company's cash flows used in financing activities was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $171.9 million in 2016. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the fact that the Company received proceeds from its note offering in 2016 but did not conduct a similar offering in 2017, offset by the reduction of cash paid for dividends and distributions over the comparable period in 2016.\nEffect of Recent Hurricanes and Named Storms\nThe Company has operations in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, and as such, its operations in those geographical areas may be impacted by disruptions related to tropical storms, should they occur.\nDuring August and September 2017, there were three named storms which made landfall in the Southeastern portion of the United States and Puerto Rico. Specifically, hurricane Harvey made landfall in August and primarily affected markets in southeast Texas; hurricane Irma made landfall on September 12, 2017 and primarily affected markets in Florida and Georgia; and hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017 and primarily affected Puerto Rico.\nThe Company has developed contingency plans designed to mitigate damage to our assets, such as removing the faces of our billboard signs prior to the storms making landfall, which better enables the structures to withstand high winds during the storm, and\nthis approach was largely successful. The named storms affecting the markets in Florida, Georgia and Texas caused little or no damage to our structures and minimal effect to our revenue, operations and/or operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our operations in those markets were fully operational as of September 30, 2017.\nWhile our physical billboard structure inventory in Puerto Rico was also largely unaffected by hurricane Maria, the island was not. The island was largely without power for most of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the storm had a significant impact on our customers in the short-term. Consequently, the Company recognized only $0.3 million in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Currently, conditions are continuing to improve, and while it may take several months for our Puerto Rico operations to be fully functioning, the Company does not expect the impact of this storm to materially impact consolidated revenue, operating income or net income for 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the revenues from our Puerto Rico operations comprised only 0.5% and 0.7% of our total consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets, goodwill impairment and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events and, where applicable, established valuation techniques. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.\nIntangible Assets. The Company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet. Intangible assets primarily represent site locations of $699.1 million and customer relationships of $80.3 million associated with the Company's acquisitions. The fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results, including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates, of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment. If actual results differ from management's assumptions, an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined. Historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the Company's intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment. The Company has a significant amount of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and must perform an impairment test of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have identified two reporting units (Logo operations and Billboard operations) in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 and no changes have been made to our reporting units from the prior period.\nWhen testing for impairment, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The key assumptions used in the analysis for each reporting unit include future operating performance, terminal rate of growth and weighted average cost of capital. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit, we would record an impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment charge was recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. The Company had an asset retirement obligation of $215.1 million as of December 31, 2017. This liability relates to the Company's obligation upon the termination or non-renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition. The Company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred. The liability is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset's carrying amount. Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. In calculating the liability, the Company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle, adjusted for inflation and market risk.\nThis calculation includes 100% of the Company's billboard structures on leased land (which currently consist of approximately 74,500 structures). The Company uses a 15-year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets, including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets, which includes the initial term of the lease, plus consideration of any renewal period. Historical third-party cost information is used to estimate the cost of dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on the Company's historical credit-adjusted risk free rate.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATORY UPDATE\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Codified as ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.\nThe Company completed its review of contracts during the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined the adoption of ASC 606 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The substantial majority of the Company's revenues are derived from billboard, logo and transit space contracts with customers which are currently accounted for as leases under ASC 840, Leases. We will continue to account for these revenues under ASC 840, Leases through December 31, 2018. Through our contract review we have determined the majority of our space contracts with customers will not meet the criteria of a lease upon the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases on January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2019 our revenues from new and modified contracts for billboard, logo and transit space will be accounted for within ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our production revenues will be recognized in accordance with ASC 606 beginning January 1, 2018. We adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 using the cumulative effect transition method. The Company will not have an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings for the adoption of this update.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The amendments are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company's 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect retrospective adoption of the update and the impact was not considered material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective beginning January 1, 2019 with retrospective application. The Company is the process of assessing the impact ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are disclosed in Note 6.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update is designed to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this updated did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the update for the period ended December 31, 2016. The update did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the definition of a business. The update clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is allowed for transactions which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company adopted the update in ASU No. 2017-01 for transactions which occurred on or after October 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. The update simplifies how a company completes its goodwill impairment test by eliminating the two-step process, which requires determining the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The update requires completing the goodwill impairment test by comparing the difference between the reporting units carrying value and fair\nvalue. Goodwill charges, if any, would be determined by reducing the goodwill balance by the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value. The update is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on or after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted this update for its December 31, 2017 goodwill impairment test.\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842) - Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842. The update provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance in Topic 840. An entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements under Topic 842 upon adoption. An entity that does not elect this practical expedient should evaluate all existing or expired land easements in connection with the adoption of the new lease requirements in Topic 842 to assess whether they meet the definition of a lease. The Company plans to elect the provided practical expedients within this update upon our adoption of Topic 842.\nLAMAR MEDIA CORP.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct advertising expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.6 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Lamar Media recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of its senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of its Term A-1 loan under the senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.8 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $318.1 million, as compared to net income of $299.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,525,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 318,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,664\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,961\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 671,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.8 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.7 million as compared to $489.3 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets of over 1.5%. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to Lamar Media's acquisition of five new U.S markets in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to an $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.1 million to $439.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Lamar Media recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of the Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes. See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.6 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $299.2 million, as compared to net income of $262.9 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,353,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,457,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,765\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,330\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 591,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.8 million.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company's net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company's ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, which affect the rates the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays.\nHistorically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Cash,\u201d for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately $297.3 million. See Uses of Cash-Acquisitions,\u201d for more information.\nThe Company's business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the past three years:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard - Traditional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard - Digital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logos\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land and buildings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PP&E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 109,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 110,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to approximate our 2017 spending.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and acquisition-adjusted net revenue.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets and investments.\nFFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate non-controlling interest.\nWe define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) non-cash tax expense (benefit); (iv) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (v) amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (viii) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (ix) an adjustment for non-controlling interest.\nAcquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as acquisition net revenue\u201d. In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period.\nAdjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as depreciation and amortization may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period over period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (4) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct advertising expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.2 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of Lamar Media's senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.7 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $317.7 million, as compared to net income of $298.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,525,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 317,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,664\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,961\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 671,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.4 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.3 million as compared to $488.9 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.0 million to $439.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.0 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.5 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $298.8 million, as compared to net income of $262.6 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by\nadding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,353,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,457,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,765\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,330\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 591,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.5 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 10.6% to $488.9 million as compared to $442.1 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, corporate expenses and interest expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nThe Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the principal borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media.\nSources of Cash\nTotal Liquidity at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately $354.6 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $115.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $239.1 million of availability under the revolving portion of Lamar Media's senior credit facility. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility, and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility.\nCash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 our cash provided by operating activities was $507.0 million, $521.8 million and $477.7 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the same period in 2016 relates to an increase in revenues offset by increases in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities. We generated cash flows from operations during 2017 in excess of our cash needs for operations and capital expenditures as described herein. We used the excess cash generated principally to pay dividends and fund our acquisitions. See - Cash Flows\u201d for more information.\nCredit Facilities. On May 15, 2017, Lamar Media entered into a Third Restatement Agreement ( Restatement Agreement\u201d) with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media's existing senior credit facility. The Restatement Agreement amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 3, 2014, as amended, which consisted of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a $300.0 million Term A loan facility. On January 7, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Incremental Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2014 with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as\nadministrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Incremental Amendment established a $300.0 million Term A-1 loan as a new class of incremental term loan. Lamar Media borrowed the $300.0 million in Term A-1 loans on January 7, 2016. The Term A-1 loan was repaid in full with the proceeds of an intuitional private placement of senior notes on January 28, 2016.\nLamar Media's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (as amended, the senior credit facility\u201d) consists of (i) a new $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which will mature on May 15, 2022, (ii) a new $450.0 million Term A loan facility (the Term A loans\u201d) which will mature on May 15, 2022, and (iii) an incremental facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to pro forma compliance with the secured debt ratio financial maintenance covenant described under Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility.\u201d\nUnder the senior credit facility Lamar Media borrowed all $450.0 million in Term A loans on May 15, 2017. The net proceeds, together with borrowing under the revolving portion of senior credit facility and cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the existing senior credit facility, and all revolving commitments under that facility were terminated.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior credit facility was $636.8 million, consisting of $438.8 million outstanding in Term A loans and $198.0 million of revolving credit loans. In addition, Lamar Media had approximately $239.1 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility included in the senior credit facility.\nNote Offerings. On January 28, 2016, Lamar Media completed an institutional private placement of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026. The institutional private placement resulted in net proceeds to Lamar Media, after payment of fees and expenses of approximately $394.5 million. Lamar Media used the proceeds of this offering to repay the $300.0 million Term A-1 loan, which it borrowed on January 7, 2016 in order to fund the acquisition of certain assets of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., and a portion of the borrowing outstanding under its revolving credit facility. On September 1, 2016, Lamar Media completed an exchange offer for all of its then outstanding 5 3/4% Senior Notes, which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an equal principal amount of newly issued 5 3/4% Senior Notes that were so registered. Lamar Media did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer.\nFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\nInternally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers.\nCredit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the senior credit facility and its outstanding debt securities.\nRestrictions Under Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to its outstanding debt securities. Currently Lamar Media has outstanding $500 million 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in February 2012 (the 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $535 million 5% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2012 (the 5% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $510 million 5 3/8% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 (the 5 3/8% Senior Notes\u201d) and the $400 million 5 3/4% Senior Notes issued in January 2016 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). On February 16, 2018, we announced that we intend to redeem all $500.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes on March 19, 2018.\nThe indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media's restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision.\nIn addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets:\n \u2022 up to $1.5 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility; \n \u2022 indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt; \n \u2022 inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries; \n \u2022 certain purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations to acquire or lease property in the ordinary course of business that cannot exceed the greater of $50 million or 5% of Lamar Media's net tangible assets; and \n \u2022 additional debt not to exceed $75 million. \nRestrictions under Senior Credit Facility. Lamar Media is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions under the senior credit facility. If the Company or Lamar Media fails to comply with these tests, the lenders under the senior credit facility will be entitled to exercise certain remedies, including the termination of the lending commitments and the acceleration of the debt payments under the senior credit facility. At December 31, 2017, and currently, we were in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility.\nLamar Media must maintain a secured debt ratio, defined as total consolidated secured debt of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries, minus the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness subject to exceptions, one of which is that it may incur additional indebtedness not exceeding the greater of $250.0 million and 6% of its total assets.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional unsecured senior indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its senior debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (excluding subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended is less than 4.5 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional subordinated indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (including subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended, is less than 6.5 to 1.0.\nUnder the senior credit facility, EBITDA\u201d means, for any period, operating income for Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis without duplication in accordance with GAAP) for such period (calculated (A) before (i) taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) any other non-cash income or charges accrued for such period, (vi) charges and expenses in connection with the senior credit facility, any actual or proposed acquisition, disposition or investment (excluding, in each case, purchases and sales of advertising space and operating assets in the ordinary course of business) and any actual or proposed offering of securities, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness (or amendment to any agreement relating to indebtedness), including any refinancing thereof, or recapitalization and (vii) any loss or gain relating to amounts paid or earned in cash prior to the stated settlement date of any swap agreement that has been reflected in operating income for such period) and (B) after giving effect to the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies projected by Lamar Media in good faith to be realized as a result of any acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition within 18 months of any such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such action; provided, (a) the aggregate amount for all such cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies will not exceed an amount equal to 15% of EBITDA for the applicable four quarter period and (b) any such adjustment to EBITDA may only take into account cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies that are (I) directly attributable to such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, (II) expected to have a continuing impact on Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries and (III) factually supportable, in each case all as certified by the chief financial officer of Lamar Media) on behalf of Lamar Media, and excluding (except to the extent received or paid in cash by Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its restricted subsidiaries income or loss attributable to equity in affiliates for such period), excluding any extraordinary and unusual gains or losses during such period, and excluding the proceeds of any casualty events and dispositions. For purposes hereof, the effect thereon of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R shall be excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, Lamar Media has consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA will be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period.\nThe Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs through fiscal 2018. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company's balance sheet.\nUses of Cash\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We anticipate our 2018 total capital expenditures will closely approximate our 2017 spending.\nAcquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed approximately 50 acquisitions for a cash purchase price of $297.3 million, which included the acquisition of more than 2,700 billboard displays across various markets. The acquisitions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2017 were financed using available cash on hand or borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nStock Repurchase Program. On December 11, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's Class A common stock. There were no repurchases under the repurchase program and the repurchase program expired on June 30, 2016.\nNote Redemption. On February 16, 2018, Lamar Media announced its intent to redeem in full all $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes. The redemption will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes and terms of the notice of redemption. Lamar Media expects the notes to be redeemed on March 19, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 101.958% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to (but not including) the redemption date. Lamar intends to fund the redemption through borrowings from the establishment of a new term loan facility under Lamar Media's senior credit facility. See Sources of Cash-Credit Facility for more information.\nTerm A Loans. The Term A loans mature on May 15, 2022 and began amortizing on September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining quarterly installments scheduled to be paid on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 are as follows:\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> Principal Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Principal Amount\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> March 31, 2018-June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,625.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2019-June 30, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,437.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2020-March 31, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,875.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term A Loan Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor each borrowing of Term A loans or revolving credit loans, Lamar Media can elect whether such loans bear interest at (i) the Adjusted Base Rate plus (a) 0.75%, or (b) 0.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus (a) 1.75%, or (b) 1.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements. The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A loans and revolving credit facility.\nDividends. On February 22, 2018, Lamar Advertising Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.91 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on March 19, 2018. The Company expects aggregate quarterly distributions to stockholders in 2018, including the dividend payable on March 29, 2018 (but excluding the dividend paid on January 2, 2018, described below), will total $3.65 per common share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared distributions of $325.5 million or $3.32 per share of common stock, including paid distributions of $243.9 million or $2.49 per share of common stock. On January 2, 2018, the Company paid its quarterly distribution declared on November 28, 2017 of $0.83 per share to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on December 18, 2017, for approximately $81.5 million.\nThe Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company's control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on\ndistributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company's ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company's distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nDebt Service and Contractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.56 billion. In the future, Lamar Media has principal reduction obligations and revolver commitment reductions under the senior credit facility. In addition, it has fixed commercial commitments. These commitments are detailed as follows:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,556.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,027.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,443.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest obligations on long term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 739.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billboard site and other operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 305.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 236.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 809.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total payments due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,845.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 642.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,490.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,363.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Interest rates on our variable rate instruments are assuming rates at the December 2017 levels. \nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Expiration Per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Amount\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than 1\nYear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Bank Facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 450.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby Letters of Credit(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) Lamar Media had $198.0 million outstanding under the revolving facility at December 31, 2017. \n (3) The standby letters of credit are issued under Lamar Media's revolving credit facility and reduce the availability of the facility by the same amount. \nCash Flows\nThe Company's cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in revenues of approximately $41.0 million, offset by an increase of interest expense of approximately $4.7 million, an increase of operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) of approximately $27.0 million and an increase in operating net assets of $29.0 million, as compared to the comparable period in 2016.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $280.9 million from $681.0 million in 2016 to $400.1 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in acquisition activity of $287.7 million as compared to the same period in 2016.\nThe Company's cash flows used in financing activities was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $171.9 million in 2016. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the fact that the Company received proceeds from its note offering in 2016 but did not conduct a similar offering in 2017, offset by the reduction of cash paid for dividends and distributions over the comparable period in 2016.\nEffect of Recent Hurricanes and Named Storms\nThe Company has operations in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, and as such, its operations in those geographical areas may be impacted by disruptions related to tropical storms, should they occur.\nDuring August and September 2017, there were three named storms which made landfall in the Southeastern portion of the United States and Puerto Rico. Specifically, hurricane Harvey made landfall in August and primarily affected markets in southeast Texas; hurricane Irma made landfall on September 12, 2017 and primarily affected markets in Florida and Georgia; and hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017 and primarily affected Puerto Rico.\nThe Company has developed contingency plans designed to mitigate damage to our assets, such as removing the faces of our billboard signs prior to the storms making landfall, which better enables the structures to withstand high winds during the storm, and\nthis approach was largely successful. The named storms affecting the markets in Florida, Georgia and Texas caused little or no damage to our structures and minimal effect to our revenue, operations and/or operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our operations in those markets were fully operational as of September 30, 2017.\nWhile our physical billboard structure inventory in Puerto Rico was also largely unaffected by hurricane Maria, the island was not. The island was largely without power for most of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the storm had a significant impact on our customers in the short-term. Consequently, the Company recognized only $0.3 million in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Currently, conditions are continuing to improve, and while it may take several months for our Puerto Rico operations to be fully functioning, the Company does not expect the impact of this storm to materially impact consolidated revenue, operating income or net income for 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the revenues from our Puerto Rico operations comprised only 0.5% and 0.7% of our total consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets, goodwill impairment and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events and, where applicable, established valuation techniques. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.\nIntangible Assets. The Company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet. Intangible assets primarily represent site locations of $699.1 million and customer relationships of $80.3 million associated with the Company's acquisitions. The fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results, including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates, of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment. If actual results differ from management's assumptions, an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined. Historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the Company's intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment. The Company has a significant amount of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and must perform an impairment test of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have identified two reporting units (Logo operations and Billboard operations) in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 and no changes have been made to our reporting units from the prior period.\nWhen testing for impairment, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The key assumptions used in the analysis for each reporting unit include future operating performance, terminal rate of growth and weighted average cost of capital. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit, we would record an impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment charge was recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. The Company had an asset retirement obligation of $215.1 million as of December 31, 2017. This liability relates to the Company's obligation upon the termination or non-renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition. The Company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred. The liability is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset's carrying amount. Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. In calculating the liability, the Company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle, adjusted for inflation and market risk.\nThis calculation includes 100% of the Company's billboard structures on leased land (which currently consist of approximately 74,500 structures). The Company uses a 15-year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets, including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets, which includes the initial term of the lease, plus consideration of any renewal period. Historical third-party cost information is used to estimate the cost of dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on the Company's historical credit-adjusted risk free rate.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATORY UPDATE\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Codified as ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.\nThe Company completed its review of contracts during the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined the adoption of ASC 606 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The substantial majority of the Company's revenues are derived from billboard, logo and transit space contracts with customers which are currently accounted for as leases under ASC 840, Leases. We will continue to account for these revenues under ASC 840, Leases through December 31, 2018. Through our contract review we have determined the majority of our space contracts with customers will not meet the criteria of a lease upon the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases on January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2019 our revenues from new and modified contracts for billboard, logo and transit space will be accounted for within ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our production revenues will be recognized in accordance with ASC 606 beginning January 1, 2018. We adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 using the cumulative effect transition method. The Company will not have an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings for the adoption of this update.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The amendments are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company's 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect retrospective adoption of the update and the impact was not considered material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective beginning January 1, 2019 with retrospective application. The Company is the process of assessing the impact ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are disclosed in Note 6.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update is designed to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this updated did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the update for the period ended December 31, 2016. The update did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the definition of a business. The update clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is allowed for transactions which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company adopted the update in ASU No. 2017-01 for transactions which occurred on or after October 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. The update simplifies how a company completes its goodwill impairment test by eliminating the two-step process, which requires determining the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The update requires completing the goodwill impairment test by comparing the difference between the reporting units carrying value and fair\nvalue. Goodwill charges, if any, would be determined by reducing the goodwill balance by the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value. The update is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on or after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted this update for its December 31, 2017 goodwill impairment test.\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842) - Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842. The update provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance in Topic 840. An entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements under Topic 842 upon adoption. An entity that does not elect this practical expedient should evaluate all existing or expired land easements in connection with the adoption of the new lease requirements in Topic 842 to assess whether they meet the definition of a lease. The Company plans to elect the provided practical expedients within this update upon our adoption of Topic 842.\nLAMAR MEDIA CORP.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct advertising expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.6 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Lamar Media recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of its senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of its Term A-1 loan under the senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.8 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $318.1 million, as compared to net income of $299.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,541,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,525,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 318,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,126\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,127\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,664\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18,961\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 671,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.8 million.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.7 million as compared to $489.3 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets of over 1.5%. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to Lamar Media's acquisition of five new U.S markets in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to an $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.1 million to $439.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Lamar Media recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of the Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes. See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.6 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $299.2 million, as compared to net income of $262.9 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,353,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,500,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,457,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\nIncrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 299,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 262,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,095\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,765\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,330\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 591,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.8 million.

These statements speak only as of the date of this document, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the statements, except as may be required by law.\nLAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company's net revenues are derived primarily from the rental of advertising space on outdoor advertising displays owned and operated by the Company. Revenue growth is based on many factors that include the Company's ability to increase occupancy of its existing advertising displays; raise advertising rates; and acquire new advertising displays and its operating results are therefore affected by general economic conditions, as well as trends in the advertising industry. Advertising spending is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, which affect the rates the Company is able to charge for advertising on its displays and its ability to maximize advertising sales or occupancy on its displays.\nHistorically, the Company has made strategic acquisitions of outdoor advertising assets to increase the number of outdoor advertising displays it operates in existing and new markets. The Company continues to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. The Company has financed its historical acquisitions and intends to finance any future acquisition activity from available cash, borrowings under its senior credit facility or the issuance of debt or equity securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Cash,\u201d for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed acquisitions for a total cash purchase price of approximately $297.3 million. See Uses of Cash-Acquisitions,\u201d for more information.\nThe Company's business requires expenditures for maintenance and capitalized costs associated with the construction of new billboard displays, the entrance into and renewal of logo sign and transit contracts, and the purchase of real estate and operating equipment. The following table presents a breakdown of capitalized expenditures for the past three years:\n\nWe expect our 2018 capital expenditures to approximate our 2017 spending.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nOur management reviews our performance by focusing on several key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d), Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and acquisition-adjusted net revenue.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets and investments.\nFFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate non-controlling interest.\nWe define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) non-cash tax expense (benefit); (iv) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (v) amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (viii) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (ix) an adjustment for non-controlling interest.\nAcquisition-adjusted net revenue adjusts our net revenue for the prior period by adding to it the net revenue generated by the acquired assets before our acquisition of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating acquisition-adjusted revenue, therefore, we include revenue generated by assets that we did not own in the period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue generated by the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as acquisition net revenue\u201d. In addition, we also adjust the prior period to subtract revenue generated by the assets that have been divested since the prior period and, therefore, no revenue derived from those assets is reflected in the current period.\nAdjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as depreciation and amortization may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) acquisition-adjusted net revenue is a supplement to net revenue to enable investors to compare period over period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (4) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and acquisition-adjusted net revenue to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.2 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of Lamar Media's senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.7 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $317.7 million, as compared to net income of $298.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\n\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.4 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization) of $25.7 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and corporate expenses of $11.7 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Income/FFO/AFFO\n(in thousands)\n\nFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $513.0 million as compared to FFO of $475.6 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.3 million as compared to $488.9 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired in the five new U.S. markets purchased in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.0 million to $439.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.0 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of Lamar Media's Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.5 million increase in net income before income taxes. The Company recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, the Company recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $298.8 million, as compared to net income of $262.6 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by\nadding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\n\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.5 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $95.1 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and corporate expenses of $29.2 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Income/FFO/AFFO\n\nFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $475.6 million as compared to FFO of $430.9 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 10.6% to $488.9 million as compared to $442.1 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense), partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, corporate expenses and interest expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nThe Company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility. The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Lamar Media Corp., is the principal borrower under the senior credit facility and maintains all corporate operating cash balances. Any cash requirements of the Company, therefore, must be funded by distributions from Lamar Media.\nSources of Cash\nTotal Liquidity at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017 we had approximately $354.6 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $115.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $239.1 million of availability under the revolving portion of Lamar Media's senior credit facility. We are currently in compliance with the maintenance covenant included in the senior credit facility, and we would remain in compliance after giving effect to borrowing the full amount available to us under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility.\nCash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 our cash provided by operating activities was $507.0 million, $521.8 million and $477.7 million, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 over the same period in 2016 relates to an increase in revenues offset by increases in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities. We generated cash flows from operations during 2017 in excess of our cash needs for operations and capital expenditures as described herein. We used the excess cash generated principally to pay dividends and fund our acquisitions. See - Cash Flows\u201d for more information.\nCredit Facilities. On May 15, 2017, Lamar Media entered into a Third Restatement Agreement ( Restatement Agreement\u201d) with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media's existing senior credit facility. The Restatement Agreement amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 3, 2014, as amended, which consisted of a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a $300.0 million Term A loan facility. On January 7, 2016, Lamar Media entered into Incremental Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 3, 2014 with the Company, certain of Lamar Media's subsidiaries as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as\nadministrative agent and the lenders party thereto. The Incremental Amendment established a $300.0 million Term A-1 loan as a new class of incremental term loan. Lamar Media borrowed the $300.0 million in Term A-1 loans on January 7, 2016. The Term A-1 loan was repaid in full with the proceeds of an intuitional private placement of senior notes on January 28, 2016.\nLamar Media's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2017 (as amended, the senior credit facility\u201d) consists of (i) a new $450.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility which will mature on May 15, 2022, (ii) a new $450.0 million Term A loan facility (the Term A loans\u201d) which will mature on May 15, 2022, and (iii) an incremental facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to pro forma compliance with the secured debt ratio financial maintenance covenant described under Restrictions under Senior Credit Facility.\u201d\nUnder the senior credit facility Lamar Media borrowed all $450.0 million in Term A loans on May 15, 2017. The net proceeds, together with borrowing under the revolving portion of senior credit facility and cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the existing senior credit facility, and all revolving commitments under that facility were terminated.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior credit facility was $636.8 million, consisting of $438.8 million outstanding in Term A loans and $198.0 million of revolving credit loans. In addition, Lamar Media had approximately $239.1 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility included in the senior credit facility.\nNote Offerings. On January 28, 2016, Lamar Media completed an institutional private placement of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026. The institutional private placement resulted in net proceeds to Lamar Media, after payment of fees and expenses of approximately $394.5 million. Lamar Media used the proceeds of this offering to repay the $300.0 million Term A-1 loan, which it borrowed on January 7, 2016 in order to fund the acquisition of certain assets of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., and a portion of the borrowing outstanding under its revolving credit facility. On September 1, 2016, Lamar Media completed an exchange offer for all of its then outstanding 5 3/4% Senior Notes, which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an equal principal amount of newly issued 5 3/4% Senior Notes that were so registered. Lamar Media did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer.\nFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\nInternally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting internally generated cash flow are general economic conditions, specific economic conditions in the markets where the Company conducts its business and overall spending on advertising by advertisers.\nCredit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the senior credit facility and its outstanding debt securities.\nRestrictions Under Debt Securities. Lamar must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to its outstanding debt securities. Currently Lamar Media has outstanding $500 million 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in February 2012 (the 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $535 million 5% Senior Subordinated Notes issued in October 2012 (the 5% Senior Subordinated Notes\u201d), $510 million 5 3/8% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 (the 5 3/8% Senior Notes\u201d) and the $400 million 5 3/4% Senior Notes issued in January 2016 (the 5 3/4% Senior Notes\u201d). On February 16, 2018, we announced that we intend to redeem all $500.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes on March 19, 2018.\nThe indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness but permit the incurrence of indebtedness (including indebtedness under the senior credit facility), (i) if no default or event of default would result from such incurrence and (ii) if after giving effect to any such incurrence, the leverage ratio (defined as the sum of (x) total consolidated debt plus (y) the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred stock of Lamar Media's restricted subsidiaries to trailing four fiscal quarter EBITDA (as defined in the indentures)) would be less than 7.0 to 1. Currently, Lamar Media is not in default under the indentures of any of its outstanding notes and, therefore, would be permitted to incur additional indebtedness subject to the foregoing provision.\nIn addition to debt incurred under the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, the indentures relating to Lamar Media's outstanding notes permit Lamar Media to incur indebtedness pursuant to the following baskets:\n \u2022 up to $1.5 billion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility; \n \u2022 indebtedness outstanding on the date of the indentures or debt incurred to refinance outstanding debt; \n \u2022 inter-company debt between Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries or between restricted subsidiaries; \n \u2022 certain purchase money indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations to acquire or lease property in the ordinary course of business that cannot exceed the greater of $50 million or 5% of Lamar Media's net tangible assets; and \n \u2022 additional debt not to exceed $75 million. \nRestrictions under Senior Credit Facility. Lamar Media is required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions under the senior credit facility. If the Company or Lamar Media fails to comply with these tests, the lenders under the senior credit facility will be entitled to exercise certain remedies, including the termination of the lending commitments and the acceleration of the debt payments under the senior credit facility. At December 31, 2017, and currently, we were in compliance with all such tests under the senior credit facility.\nLamar Media must maintain a secured debt ratio, defined as total consolidated secured debt of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries, minus the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to EBITDA, as defined below, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, of less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is restricted from incurring additional indebtedness subject to exceptions, one of which is that it may incur additional indebtedness not exceeding the greater of $250.0 million and 6% of its total assets.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional unsecured senior indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its senior debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (excluding subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended is less than 4.5 to 1.0.\nLamar Media is also restricted from incurring additional subordinated indebtedness under certain circumstances unless, after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness, it is in compliance with the secured debt ratio covenant and its total debt ratio, defined as (a) total consolidated debt (including subordinated debt) of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries as of any date minus the lesser of (i) $150 million and (ii) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries to (b) EBITDA, as defined below, for the most recent four fiscal quarters then ended, is less than 6.5 to 1.0.\nUnder the senior credit facility, EBITDA\u201d means, for any period, operating income for Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis without duplication in accordance with GAAP) for such period (calculated (A) before (i) taxes, (ii) interest expense, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) any other non-cash income or charges accrued for such period, (vi) charges and expenses in connection with the senior credit facility, any actual or proposed acquisition, disposition or investment (excluding, in each case, purchases and sales of advertising space and operating assets in the ordinary course of business) and any actual or proposed offering of securities, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness (or amendment to any agreement relating to indebtedness), including any refinancing thereof, or recapitalization and (vii) any loss or gain relating to amounts paid or earned in cash prior to the stated settlement date of any swap agreement that has been reflected in operating income for such period) and (B) after giving effect to the amount of cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies projected by Lamar Media in good faith to be realized as a result of any acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition within 18 months of any such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such action; provided, (a) the aggregate amount for all such cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies will not exceed an amount equal to 15% of EBITDA for the applicable four quarter period and (b) any such adjustment to EBITDA may only take into account cost savings, operating expense reductions and other operating improvements or synergies that are (I) directly attributable to such acquisition, investment, merger, amalgamation or disposition, (II) expected to have a continuing impact on Lamar Media and its restricted subsidiaries and (III) factually supportable, in each case all as certified by the chief financial officer of Lamar Media) on behalf of Lamar Media, and excluding (except to the extent received or paid in cash by Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any of its restricted subsidiaries income or loss attributable to equity in affiliates for such period), excluding any extraordinary and unusual gains or losses during such period, and excluding the proceeds of any casualty events and dispositions. For purposes hereof, the effect thereon of any adjustments required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R shall be excluded. If during any period for which EBITDA is being determined, Lamar Media has consummated any acquisition or disposition, EBITDA will be determined on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition or disposition had been made or consummated on the first day of such period.\nThe Company believes that its current level of cash on hand, availability under the senior credit facility and future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet its operating needs through fiscal 2018. All debt obligations are reflected on the Company's balance sheet.\nUses of Cash\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were approximately $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We anticipate our 2018 total capital expenditures will closely approximate our 2017 spending.\nAcquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed approximately 50 acquisitions for a cash purchase price of $297.3 million, which included the acquisition of more than 2,700 billboard displays across various markets. The acquisitions occurring during the year ended December 31, 2017 were financed using available cash on hand or borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nStock Repurchase Program. On December 11, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's Class A common stock. There were no repurchases under the repurchase program and the repurchase program expired on June 30, 2016.\nNote Redemption. On February 16, 2018, Lamar Media announced its intent to redeem in full all $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes. The redemption will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes and terms of the notice of redemption. Lamar Media expects the notes to be redeemed on March 19, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 101.958% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to (but not including) the redemption date. Lamar intends to fund the redemption through borrowings from the establishment of a new term loan facility under Lamar Media's senior credit facility. See Sources of Cash-Credit Facility for more information.\nTerm A Loans. The Term A loans mature on May 15, 2022 and began amortizing on September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining quarterly installments scheduled to be paid on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 are as follows:\n\nFor each borrowing of Term A loans or revolving credit loans, Lamar Media can elect whether such loans bear interest at (i) the Adjusted Base Rate plus (a) 0.75%, or (b) 0.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus (a) 1.75%, or (b) 1.50% at any time that the total debt ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements. The guarantees, covenants, events of default and other terms of the senior credit facility apply to the Term A loans and revolving credit facility.\nDividends. On February 22, 2018, Lamar Advertising Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.91 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on March 19, 2018. The Company expects aggregate quarterly distributions to stockholders in 2018, including the dividend payable on March 29, 2018 (but excluding the dividend paid on January 2, 2018, described below), will total $3.65 per common share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared distributions of $325.5 million or $3.32 per share of common stock, including paid distributions of $243.9 million or $2.49 per share of common stock. On January 2, 2018, the Company paid its quarterly distribution declared on November 28, 2017 of $0.83 per share to its stockholders of record of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock on December 18, 2017, for approximately $81.5 million.\nThe Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company's control, including financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on\ndistributions in our existing and future debt instruments, the Company's ability to utilize net operating losses to offset, in whole or in part, the Company's distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nDebt Service and Contractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.56 billion. In the future, Lamar Media has principal reduction obligations and revolver commitment reductions under the senior credit facility. In addition, it has fixed commercial commitments. These commitments are detailed as follows:\n\n (1) Interest rates on our variable rate instruments are assuming rates at the December 2017 levels. \n\n (2) Lamar Media had $198.0 million outstanding under the revolving facility at December 31, 2017. \n (3) The standby letters of credit are issued under Lamar Media's revolving credit facility and reduce the availability of the facility by the same amount. \nCash Flows\nThe Company's cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in revenues of approximately $41.0 million, offset by an increase of interest expense of approximately $4.7 million, an increase of operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) of approximately $27.0 million and an increase in operating net assets of $29.0 million, as compared to the comparable period in 2016.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $280.9 million from $681.0 million in 2016 to $400.1 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in acquisition activity of $287.7 million as compared to the same period in 2016.\nThe Company's cash flows used in financing activities was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $171.9 million in 2016. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the fact that the Company received proceeds from its note offering in 2016 but did not conduct a similar offering in 2017, offset by the reduction of cash paid for dividends and distributions over the comparable period in 2016.\nEffect of Recent Hurricanes and Named Storms\nThe Company has operations in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, and as such, its operations in those geographical areas may be impacted by disruptions related to tropical storms, should they occur.\nDuring August and September 2017, there were three named storms which made landfall in the Southeastern portion of the United States and Puerto Rico. Specifically, hurricane Harvey made landfall in August and primarily affected markets in southeast Texas; hurricane Irma made landfall on September 12, 2017 and primarily affected markets in Florida and Georgia; and hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017 and primarily affected Puerto Rico.\nThe Company has developed contingency plans designed to mitigate damage to our assets, such as removing the faces of our billboard signs prior to the storms making landfall, which better enables the structures to withstand high winds during the storm, and\nthis approach was largely successful. The named storms affecting the markets in Florida, Georgia and Texas caused little or no damage to our structures and minimal effect to our revenue, operations and/or operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our operations in those markets were fully operational as of September 30, 2017.\nWhile our physical billboard structure inventory in Puerto Rico was also largely unaffected by hurricane Maria, the island was not. The island was largely without power for most of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the storm had a significant impact on our customers in the short-term. Consequently, the Company recognized only $0.3 million in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Currently, conditions are continuing to improve, and while it may take several months for our Puerto Rico operations to be fully functioning, the Company does not expect the impact of this storm to materially impact consolidated revenue, operating income or net income for 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the revenues from our Puerto Rico operations comprised only 0.5% and 0.7% of our total consolidated net revenue, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to intangible assets, goodwill impairment and asset retirement obligations. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events and, where applicable, established valuation techniques. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.\nIntangible Assets. The Company has significant intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet. Intangible assets primarily represent site locations of $699.1 million and customer relationships of $80.3 million associated with the Company's acquisitions. The fair values of intangible assets recorded are determined using discounted cash flow models that require management to make assumptions related to future operating results, including projecting net revenue growth discounted using current cost of capital rates, of each acquisition and the anticipated future economic environment. If actual results differ from management's assumptions, an impairment of these intangibles may exist and a charge to income would be made in the period such impairment is determined. Historically no impairment charge has been required with respect to the Company's intangible assets.\nGoodwill Impairment. The Company has a significant amount of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and must perform an impairment test of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have identified two reporting units (Logo operations and Billboard operations) in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350 and no changes have been made to our reporting units from the prior period.\nWhen testing for impairment, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The key assumptions used in the analysis for each reporting unit include future operating performance, terminal rate of growth and weighted average cost of capital. To the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit, we would record an impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment charge was recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. The Company had an asset retirement obligation of $215.1 million as of December 31, 2017. This liability relates to the Company's obligation upon the termination or non-renewal of a lease to dismantle and remove its billboard structures from the leased land and to reclaim the site to its original condition. The Company records the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred. The liability is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset's carrying amount. Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset. In calculating the liability, the Company calculates the present value of the estimated cost to dismantle using an average cost to dismantle, adjusted for inflation and market risk.\nThis calculation includes 100% of the Company's billboard structures on leased land (which currently consist of approximately 74,500 structures). The Company uses a 15-year retirement period based on historical operating experience in its core markets, including the actual time that billboard structures have been located on leased land in such markets and the actual length of the leases in the core markets, which includes the initial term of the lease, plus consideration of any renewal period. Historical third-party cost information is used to estimate the cost of dismantling of the structures and the reclamation of the site. The interest rate used to calculate the present value of such costs over the retirement period is based on the Company's historical credit-adjusted risk free rate.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REGULATORY UPDATE\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09 (Codified as ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.\nThe Company completed its review of contracts during the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined the adoption of ASC 606 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The substantial majority of the Company's revenues are derived from billboard, logo and transit space contracts with customers which are currently accounted for as leases under ASC 840, Leases. We will continue to account for these revenues under ASC 840, Leases through December 31, 2018. Through our contract review we have determined the majority of our space contracts with customers will not meet the criteria of a lease upon the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases on January 1, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2019 our revenues from new and modified contracts for billboard, logo and transit space will be accounted for within ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our production revenues will be recognized in accordance with ASC 606 beginning January 1, 2018. We adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 using the cumulative effect transition method. The Company will not have an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings for the adoption of this update.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The amendments are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company's 2016 consolidated balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect retrospective adoption of the update and the impact was not considered material.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements. The amendments in this update are effective beginning January 1, 2019 with retrospective application. The Company is the process of assessing the impact ASU No. 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. The Company expects the primary impact to our consolidated financial statements will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are disclosed in Note 6.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update is designed to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this updated did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the update for the period ended December 31, 2016. The update did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations: Clarifying the definition of a business. The update clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is allowed for transactions which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company adopted the update in ASU No. 2017-01 for transactions which occurred on or after October 1, 2016. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. The update simplifies how a company completes its goodwill impairment test by eliminating the two-step process, which requires determining the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. The update requires completing the goodwill impairment test by comparing the difference between the reporting units carrying value and fair\nvalue. Goodwill charges, if any, would be determined by reducing the goodwill balance by the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value. The update is effective for annual and interim fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on or after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted this update for its December 31, 2017 goodwill impairment test.\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842) - Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842. The update provides an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance in Topic 840. An entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements under Topic 842 upon adoption. An entity that does not elect this practical expedient should evaluate all existing or expired land easements in connection with the adoption of the new lease requirements in Topic 842 to assess whether they meet the definition of a lease. The Company plans to elect the provided practical expedients within this update upon our adoption of Topic 842.\nLAMAR MEDIA CORP.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Lamar Media for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Lamar Media and the related notes.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet revenues increased $41.0 million or 2.7% to $1.541 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $1.500 billion for the same period in 2016. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $28.6 million or 2.2% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2016 and 2017, and the addition of approximately 275 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $2.4 million, which represents an increase of 3.0% over the prior period. Transit revenue increased $10.0 million, which represents an increase of 9.3% over the prior period, primarily due to several new transit and airport markets acquired in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenues for the comparable period in 2016, increased $15.5 million, or 1.0%. The $15.5 million increase in revenue primarily consisted of an $8.3 million increase in billboard revenue, a $3.1 million increase in logo revenue and a $4.1 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $8.1 million or 0.9% to $879.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $8.1 million increase over the prior year is comprised of a $22.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets, partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses of $14.0 million primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation of $15.1 million over the same period in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired during 2016 and 2017.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $10.4 million over the same period in 2016. The $10.4 million decrease is comprised of a $6.6 million decrease in non-cash gains recognized for acquisition swap transactions in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, approximately $1.0 million of losses in Puerto Rico related to hurricane Maria in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $2.8 million decrease in gains related to various transactions of inventory sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $16.3 million to $455.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $439.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Lamar Media recognized a $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of its senior credit facility as compared to a $3.2 million loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2016 related to the prepayment of its Term A-1 loan under the senior credit facility.\nInterest expense increased approximately $4.7 million from $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $128.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily resulting from an increase in debt outstanding due to the refinancing of Lamar Media's senior credit facility in 2017. See - Uses of Cash for more information.\nThe increase in operating income and decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by the increase in interest expense over the comparable period in 2016, resulted in a $14.8 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $9.2 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is approximately 2.8%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $318.1 million, as compared to net income of $299.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2015 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2016 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2017.\nReconciliations of 2016 reported net revenue to 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 as well as a comparison of 2016 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2017 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\n\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2.1% to $671.8 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization) of $25.7 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and corporate expenses of $11.7 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Income/FFO/AFFO\n(in thousands)\n\nFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $513.3 million as compared to FFO of $476.0 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.5% to $496.7 million as compared to $489.3 million for the same period in 2016. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense, exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by increases in general and administrative and corporate expenses (excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense) and maintenance capitalized expenditures.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year ended December 31, 2015\nNet revenues increased $146.9 million or 10.9% to $1.50 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.35 billion for the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable primarily to an increase in billboard net revenues of $125.0 million or 10.5% over the prior period, which is primarily related to the integration of outdoor assets acquired during 2015 and 2016, which included five new U.S. markets in January 2016 from Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and the addition of approximately 300 digital displays during the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, logo sign revenue increased $5.7 million, which represents an increase of 7.6% over the prior period, primarily due to the addition of a logo program in Tennessee and an overall increase in occupancy in all other logo markets of over 1.5%. Transit revenue increased $16.2 million, which represents an increase of 17.7% over the prior period, primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Airports in July 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $42.7 million increase in net revenues as compared to acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $42.7 million increase in revenue primarily consists of a $32.6 million increase in billboard revenue, a $4.2 million increase in logo revenue and a $5.9 million increase in transit revenue over the acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue represents an increase of 2.9% over the comparable period in 2015. See Reconciliations\u201d below.\nTotal operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and gain on sale of assets, increased $83.7 million or 10.6% to $871.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $83.7 million increases over the prior year is comprised of a $79.1 million increase in operating expenses related to the operations of our outdoor advertising assets and an increase in corporate expenses of $4.6 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to Lamar Media's acquisition of five new U.S markets in January 2016.\nGain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.3 million over the same period in 2015 primarily due to an $8.6 million non-cash gain resulting from an exchange of outdoor advertising assets in the period.\nDue primarily to the above factors, operating income increased $56.1 million to $439.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $383.4 million for the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Lamar Media recognized a $3.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of the Term A-1 loan under its senior credit facility\nInterest expense increased approximately $25.3 million from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from the January 2016 issuance of Lamar Media's $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 3/4% Senior Notes. See - Uses of Cash - Tender Offers and Debt Repayment\u201d for more information.\nThe increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment over the comparable period in 2015, resulted in a $27.6 million increase in net income before income taxes. Lamar Media recognized $13.4 million in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately 4.3%, which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT and adjustments for foreign items.\nAs a result of the above factors, Lamar Media recognized net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $299.2 million, as compared to net income of $262.9 million for the same period in 2015.\nReconciliations:\nBecause acquisitions occurring after December 31, 2014 have contributed to our net revenue results for the periods presented, we provide 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue, which adjusts our 2015 net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 by adding to or subtracting from it the net revenue generated by the acquired or divested assets prior to our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations of 2015 reported net revenue to 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as a comparison of 2015 acquisition-adjusted net revenue to 2016 reported net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, are provided below:\nReconciliation and Comparison of Reported Net Revenue to Acquisition-Adjusted Net Revenue\n\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Income/Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.1% to $657.8 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) of $95.1 million, and was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative and corporate expenses of $29.1 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.\nNet Income/FFO/AFFO\n(in thousands)\n\nFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $476.0 million as compared to FFO of $431.2 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 10.6% to $489.3 million as compared to $442.4 million for the same period in 2015. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (net revenue less direct advertising expense) and decrease in interest expense, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and corporate expenses.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
