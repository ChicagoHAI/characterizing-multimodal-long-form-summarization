MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nManagement's discussion and analysis, which we refer to as MD&A,\u201d of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows should be read together with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" to provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. We believe the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been an independent publicly-traded company during all of the periods presented.\nOur Business\nWe are a market leader and global supplier of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing and specialty component solutions, serving the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, military, aerospace and industrial markets. We use our leading position in micro-electro-mechanical systems (\"MEMS\") microphones and strong capabilities in speaker, receiver and audio processing technologies to optimize audio systems and improve the user experience in smartphones, tablets and wearables. We are also the leader in acoustics components used in hearing aids and have a strong position in high-end oscillators (timing devices) and capacitors. Our focus on our customers, combined with our unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, rigorous testing and global scale, enables us to deliver innovative solutions that optimize the user experience.\nOur Business Segments\nWe are organized into two reportable segments based on how management analyzes performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions. These segments were determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are comprised of (i) Mobile Consumer Electronics ( MCE\u201d) and (ii) Specialty Components ( SC\u201d). The segments are aligned around similar product applications serving our key end markets, to enhance focus on end market growth strategies.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MCE designs and manufactures innovative acoustic products, including microphones, speakers, receivers, integrated modules and audio processing technologies used in several applications that serve the handset, tablet and other consumer electronic markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities in North America, Europe and Asia; and manufacturing facilities in Asia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SC specializes in the design and manufacture of specialized electronic components used in medical and life science applications, as well as high-performance solutions and components used in communications infrastructure and a wide variety of other markets. SC's transducer products are used principally in hearing aid applications within the commercial audiology markets, while its oscillator products predominantly serve the telecom infrastructure market and its capacitor products are used in applications including radio, radar, satellite, power supplies, transceivers and medical implants serving the defense, aerospace, telecommunication and life sciences markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities are located in North America, Europe and Asia.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and to a lesser extent through distributors worldwide.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock ( Shares\u201d) of Audience, Inc. (\"Audience\"), a leading provider of intelligent voice and audio solutions that improve voice quality and the user experience in mobile devices. For additional information on the Audience acquisition, refer to Note 2. Acquisition of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 11, 2016, we announced our intent to sell the speaker and receiver product line in our mobile consumer electronics segment. While we've made operational improvements to this product line over the past several years, we do not believe this product line can leverage our long-term investment in semiconductor and software design capabilities. By exiting this product line, we anticipate meaningful improvements to our overall gross and operating margins while reducing capital expenditure investments and improving free cash flow.\nAs a result, the Company expects to reclassify the assets, liabilities and results of the operations of the product line to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2016. Knowles has not entered into any definitive agreement for the sale of the product line and there can be no assurance that Knowles will complete a sale in a timely manner or at all.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, Knowles recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191.5 million resulting from the carrying value of the speaker and receiver product line's net assets being less than their fair-market value.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the speaker and receiver product line had revenues of $235.0 million and losses before income taxes of $272.4 million.\nResults of Operations\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements and segment information were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Dover's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. Accordingly, our financial statements prior to February 28, 2014 are presented herein on a consolidated basis and reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows of our business operated as part of Dover prior to the Separation, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d or U.S. GAAP\u201d). The Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future, or what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had Knowles been a stand-alone company during all the periods presented.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared with the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures included herein, we have presented certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP measures as supplements to our GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of our business and our Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of our performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist us in comparing our performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance.\nThe Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation included herein.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,214.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP gross profit as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(236.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP (benefit from) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(233.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) earnings per share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.02\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) On July 1, 2015, the Company issued 3.2 million shares to former holders of Audience shares and for the conversion of vested in-the-money Audience stock options. The Company also converted unvested in-the-money Audience stock options and restricted stock units for an aggregate of 461,371 shares of its common stock. On February 28, 2014, Dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2014 received one share of Knowles common stock for every two shares of Dover's common stock held as of the record date. The computation of diluted earnings per common share for 2013 was calculated using the number of shares distributed on February 28, 2014. See Note 18. Earnings per Share of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding earnings per share.\nRevenues\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,084.6 million, compared with $1,141.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $56.7 million or 5.0%. This was due to a decrease in SC revenues and MCE revenues of $29.3 million and $27.4 million, respectively. SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China long-term evolution (\"LTE\") infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products. MCE revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\n2014 Versus 2013\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1,141.3 million, compared with $1,214.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $73.5 million or 6.1%. This was due to a decrease in MCE revenues of $93.1 million, partially offset by an increase in SC revenues of $19.5 million. MCE revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in MCE revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2103 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. The decreases in MCE revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year. The increase in SC revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, SC revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in SC revenues were partially offset by lower pricing. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\nCost of Goods Sold\n2015 Versus 2014\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $785.1 million, compared with $883.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $98.8 million or 11.2%. This decrease was driven by numerous factors. We had lower fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges associated with the prior year cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility (the \"Vienna action\") and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. In addition, we incurred inventory charges in the prior year related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. In the current year, we had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and cost savings from the Vienna action. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable fixed overhead absorption expenses and the impacts from increased shipping volume, which includes $12.6 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $883.9 million, compared with $775.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $108.4 million or 14.0%. The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges of $32.6 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. The increase was also due to warranty and inventory charges, as well as unfavorable fixed overhead absorption related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. Lastly, the increase was due to higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lost shipments of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and cost savings from restructuring actions.\nImpairment of Fixed and Other Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $48.2 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as we have concluded that the product line lacks a future path to profitability. On February 11, 2016 we announced our intention to sell this product line during 2016. In addition, the MCE and SC business segments recorded other impairment charges in connection with restructuring actions of $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of fixed and other assets.\nDuring 2014, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the MCE business segment.\nDuring 2013, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the SC business segment.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe undertake restructuring programs from time to time to better align our operations with current market conditions. Such activities include targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures to further optimize operations. It is likely that we will have restructuring charges in the future as we execute on our strategy to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. Details regarding restructuring programs undertaken during the reporting period are as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million, comprised primarily of the $9.5 million of restructuring expenses associated with the integration of Audience. The remaining charges primarily relate to the continued transfer of our capacitor business into lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility as part of our previously announced plan to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. As a result of the Vienna action, which was substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $20.7 million. This included $16.0 million related to severance pay and benefits and $4.7 million related to contract termination and other costs. Of the total $20.7 million in restructuring charges, $14.5 million were classified as Cost of goods sold and $6.2 million were classified as Operating expenses.\nIn conjunction with this restructuring action, we also accelerated depreciation on fixed assets and recorded inventory charges of $18.8 million and incurred production transfer costs of $6.2 million, bringing the total recorded costs related to the Vienna restructuring action to $45.7 million.\nIn line with our previously announced plans to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, we also recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 million during year ended December 31, 2014 related to other actions. These actions included programs to transfer our hearing health business and certain of our capacitor businesses into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities, as well as to reduce headcount in the consumer electronics business.\nIn 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $16.3 million relating to programs to integrate activities within the consumer electronics business, to migrate the Company's U.K.-based capacitor production into our existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and to reduce headcount within our German and North American operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market in order to better align the business with current market dynamics.\nGross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit\n2015 Versus 2014\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $242.5 million, compared with $232.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.8 million or 4.2%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 22.4%, compared with 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by: lower fixed asset and inventory charges as described above, lower restructuring and production transfer costs and the cost savings from such actions. In the current year, the Company had benefits from an increase in shipping volume, which includes the $6.3 million associated with our acquired Audience operations, as well as favorable impacts from productivity initiatives and foreign currency translations. These improvements were partially offset by lower average selling prices, increased impairment charges, higher fixed overhead absorption expenses and unfavorable product mix.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $320.7 million, compared with $335.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $15.1 million or 4.5%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 29.6%, as compared with 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower average selling prices, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower inventory charges in the current year, benefits from productivity initiatives, favorable foreign currency translations and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $232.7 million, compared with $427.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $195.2 million or 45.6%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 20.4%, compared with 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $48.1 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $335.8 million, compared with $450.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $114.3 million or 25.4%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 29.4%, as compared with 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $112.1 million and $83.0 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 10.3% and 7.3%, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily driven by our recently acquired Audience research and development operations of $21.5 million, lower revenue and an increase in new product development spending.\n2014 Versus 2013\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $83.0 million and $82.6 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 7.3% and 6.8%, respectively.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $208.1 million, compared with $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million or 5.9%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 19.2%, compared with 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was mainly due to our recently acquired Audience operations of $19.6 million, lower revenue and transaction-related expenses incurred related to the acquisition of Audience, partially offset by lower legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $196.5 million, compared with $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.5 million or 1.8%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 17.2%, compared with 15.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in selling and administrative expenses were corporate allocations from our Former Parent of $3.4 million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represent administration of treasury, employee compensation and benefits, public and investor relations, internal audit, corporate income tax, supply chain and legal services through the Separation date. In 2014, we also incurred our own costs related to such support functions as part of being an independent company for the majority of the year. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $143.3 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as the product line lacked a future path to profitability. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of intangible assets.\n(Loss) Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(236.2) million, compared with $(48.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $187.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of intangibles of $144.7 million and $43.8 million of expenses from our recently acquired Audience operations, which includes $9.5 million of restructuring expenses, partially offset by reduced legal expenses and higher GAAP gross profit.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $66.6 million, compared with $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $46.8 million or 41.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.1%, as compared with 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These declines were primarily due to lower non-GAAP gross profit and higher non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.3 million, which primarily relate to our recently acquired Audience operations. The decrease was partially offset by reduced legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $(48.5) million, compared with $143.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $192.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $45.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Additionally, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $16.1 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $113.4 million, compared with $222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $108.9 million or 49.0%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 9.9%, as compared with 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nInterest Expense, net\n2015 Versus 2014\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $12.7 million, compared with $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.1 million or 92.4%. The increase in interest expense was due to a combination of a higher average debt balance outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to a draw down from our revolving credit facility to fund the Audience acquisition and higher interest rates. Additionally, during 2015 we had twelve months of interest expense for our Credit facilities compared to only ten months of interest expense during 2014. We incurred $400.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities on February 28, 2014.\n2014 Versus 2013\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, compared with $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $35.4 million or 84.3%. During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into five-year credit facilities totaling $500.0 million and borrowed $400.0 million on February 28, 2014 to finance a cash payment to Dover in connection with the Separation. The interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to these borrowings. The interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2013 relates to interest expense on the net notes payable to Dover that were settled during the fourth quarter of 2013 in anticipation of the Separation.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes and Non-GAAP (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nThe effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a 6.1% benefit, compared with a 57.9% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the ETR is due primarily to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by two tax holidays granted to us by Malaysia effective through December 31, 2021, offset unfavorably by the impact of valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions (United States (\"U.S.\"), Austria and China). For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31,2015 was a 5.4% benefit, compared with an 11.7% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss, the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia, and judgments as to the realizability of our deferred tax assets. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021. The U.S. and Austrian operations were in cumulative loss positions as of December 31, 2015. Based on this, the speaker and receiver product line asset impairments, and other relevant information, the Company concluded that tax losses and deferred assets generated in the U.S. and Austria would not be benefited currently or in the future.\n2014 Versus 2013\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements reflect income tax expense and deferred tax balances that have been calculated on a stand-alone basis although our operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by our Former Parent.\nThe ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a 57.9% provision, compared with a 4.2% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by net discrete items of $38.2 million. The discrete items recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by a Malaysian tax holiday of $4.4 million. The discrete benefit from the Malaysian tax holiday relates to 2013; however, it was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 when we received approval from the relevant taxing authority. For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". Absent the discrete items, the ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.4% benefit, compared with a 6.4% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the ETR, excluding the discrete items, was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.7% provision, compared with an 8.0% provision for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss and the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021.\nDiluted (Loss) Earnings per Share and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share\n2015 Versus 2014\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(2.69) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT, partially offset by income tax benefits.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.65, compared with $1.10 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT.\n2014 Versus 2013\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $1.24 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT and the impact of a discrete tax expense resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $35.4 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.10, compared with $1.95 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.05 related to the discrete Malaysia tax holiday benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense.\nReconciliation

Knowles uses non-GAAP measures as supplements to its GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of its business, and its Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist Knowles in comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(2) Production Transfer Costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to new or existing facilities in Asia. These amounts are included in the corresponding Gross profit, Selling and administrative expenses, Operating expenses and Loss before interest and income taxes for each period presented.\n(3) In 2015, \"Other\" in Gross profit and Operating expenses represent expenses related to the Audience acquisition. In 2014, \"Other\" in Gross profit represents a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. In 2014, \"Other\" in Operating expenses represents expenses related to the spin-off of Knowles from Dover Corporation.\n(4) The Non-GAAP reconciling adjustments are those adjustments made to reconcile Loss before interest and income taxes to Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes.\n(5) Diluted average shares outstanding are consistent with basic average shares outstanding as all periods are reporting a net loss.\n(6) The number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations on a non-GAAP basis excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.\nSegment Results

Revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE revenues were $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $777.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $93.1 million or 12.0%. Revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level product defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nMCE operating loss was $(239.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease in earnings of $165.2 million. The decrease was due primarily to intangible and fixed asset impairments in the speaker and receiver product line of $191.5 million, as it lacked a future path to profitability. In addition, MCE's decrease was affected by lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $41.1 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations and related restructuring actions of $9.5 million. In addition, MCE had unfavorable fixed overhead absorption and product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower restructuring and related charges from the Vienna actions as well as cost savings from the Vienna action. MCE also experienced an increase in revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption. In addition, MCE had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $31.3 million or 66.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.4%, compared with 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $30.3 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower impacts from the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold in 2014, cost savings from the Vienna action, favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE operating (loss) earnings were $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $197.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges, restructuring charges and production transfer costs of $55.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from the Vienna restructuring action.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $171.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $124.7 million or 72.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9%, compared with 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold, ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from the Vienna restructuring action.\nSpecialty Components\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>457.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangibles amortization expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed asset, inventory and other charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production transfer costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Production transfer costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to new or existing facilities in Asia.

SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China LTE infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC revenues were $457.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $437.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $19.5 million or 4.5%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower pricing.\nOperating Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nSC operating earnings were $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $8.8 million or 12.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $10.7 million or 10.4%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 21.6%, compared with 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC operating earnings were $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $5.0 million or 7.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes, cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing and higher production transfer costs of $7.5 million, mainly driven by the transfer of our hearing health business into a new, lower-cost Asian manufacturing facility.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.8 million or 10.5%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 22.6%, compared with 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense, partially offset by lower pricing.\nFinancial Condition\nHistorically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. As a result of the Separation, we no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with our Former Parent. Historically, we have utilized these arrangements to fund significant expenditures, such as manufacturing capacity expansion and acquisitions. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. We believe that our future cash flow from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our working capital needs, dividends (if any), capital expenditures and strategic investments. We have secured a revolving line of credit in the United States from a syndicate of commercial banks to provide additional liquidity. Furthermore, if we were to require additional cash in the United States above and beyond our domestic cash on the balance sheet, the free cash flow generated by the domestic businesses and availability under our revolving credit facility, we would most likely seek to raise long-term financing through the U.S. debt or bank markets.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Audience. Under the terms of the transaction, we issued 3.2 million shares and paid $61.6 million in cash to former holders of Shares and for the settlement of vested Audience stock options. We funded the cash portion of the consideration through a draw down from our existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand. In addition, the amendment to our existing credit agreement to modify specific terms and conditions, including the definition of certain covenants to permit the acquisition, became effective upon the closing of the transaction.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including third party debt incurred in connection with the Separation, as well as any debt that we may incur in the future, will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash from operations, financings or asset sales and the tax consequences of our repatriation of overseas cash. Due to the global nature of our operations, a significant portion of our cash is held outside the Unites States. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $63.3 million and $55.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, cash held by our non-U.S. operations totaled $59.7 million and $53.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe hold the vast majority of our cash and operating cash flows outside the United States, since this cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our capital expenditures and growth plans, as our manufacturing locations are primarily based outside of the United States. We have not provided for U.S. income taxes on $1.8 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, because we intend to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the United States.\nWe generate cash flow in the United States primarily through ongoing product sales, management fees and royalty income and we utilize cash in the United States primarily for expenses relating to operations and corporate functions, including management, administration and research and development. We have generated approximately $15.4 million, $36.4 million and $43.7 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the United States, as defined below, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which has been sufficient to meet our domestic cash needs in each such year, as most of our capital expenditures and expenses occurred outside of the United States during those years. Adjusted operating cash flow in the United States is not presented in accordance with GAAP and is defined as operating cash flow generated within the United States, net of corporate expense allocations, but excluding net U.S. interest expense related to intercompany notes payable to our Former Parent of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The adjusted operating cash flow in the United States amounts exclude U.S. interest expense related to intercompany net notes payable to our Former Parent, as these notes were settled prior to the Separation and these amounts are not necessarily representative of interest payments related to our future debt. We project that our cash generation within the United States for the foreseeable future will be self-sustaining to meet all estimated U.S. expenditures and, as such, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy our domestic cash needs, including the service of any third party debt incurred in the United States.\nOur management will continue to reassess our need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nCash Flow Summary\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized in the following table:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased $37.1 million compared to 2014, primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower revenues. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly accrued other expenses and deferred taxes, decreased operating cash flows. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $18.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $58.8 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower revenues and increased restructuring and production transfer related expenses. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $32.2 million. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly deferred taxes and accrued other expenses, increased operating cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities results primarily from cash outflows for capital expenditures, the capitalization of patent defense costs and investment activity.\nCapital spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $63.1 million, $83.9 million and $105.2 million, or 5.8%, 7.4% and 8.7% as a percentage of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The large drivers of the capital expenditures have been related to investment in new product launches, the ongoing investment in MEMS manufacturing capacity expansion to support growth in the handset market as well as manufacturing footprint optimization projects. Construction and customization of a new manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines started in 2012 and continued throughout 2013. Fully operational in 2014, this 215,000 square foot facility supports several growth and productivity initiatives for us.\nCapitalization of patent defense costs. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically seven to ten years. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid $1.0 million, $16.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in gross legal costs related to the defense of our patents. Capitalized patent defense costs decreased in 2015 due primarily to lower legal expenses incurred in 2014 associated with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nAcquisitions and sales of investments. We paid $35.1 million, net of cash acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 to acquire Audience. We received proceeds of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from the sale of investments, which were part of the acquisition of Audience. We paid $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to acquire a non-controlling interest in a MEMS timing device company and subsequently received proceeds of $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 from the sale of our non-controlling interest in the same MEMS timing device company.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $45.0 million in additional net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the $15.0 million in scheduled principal payments on our term loan, whereas cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to cash payments to our Former Parent of $468.2 million as a result of the Separation, partially offset by $400.0 million in proceeds from debt. For additional information on our debt, see Note 11. Borrowings and Lines of Credit of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our management believes these measures are useful in measuring our cash generated from operations and cash generated from operations as a percentage of revenue that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase Knowles' common stock. Free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue are not presented in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. As such, free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nOur businesses tend to have stronger revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles due to the highly technical nature of the industries they serve, which can result in new OEM product launches that can impact quarterly revenues, earnings and cash flow.\nThe following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, we generated free cash flow of $15.3 million, representing 1.4% of revenue, compared to free cash flow in 2014 of $31.6 million, representing 2.8% of revenue and free cash flow in 2013 of $69.1 million, or 5.7% of revenue. The decrease in free cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to a reduction in earnings. The lower free cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a reduction in earnings.\nIn 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0% of revenue.\nContingent Obligations\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and investigations arising in the normal course of business.

Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings and Lines of Credit\nOn January 27, 2014, we entered into a $200.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility, as well as a $300.0 million five-year senior secured term loan facility pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement, which are referred to collectively as the Credit Facilities.\u201d In connection with the Separation, we incurred $100.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $300.0 million of borrowings under the term loan facility, in each case to finance a cash payment to Dover immediately prior to the Separation.\nOn December 31, 2014, we amended our Credit Facilities to (i) increase the amount of the revolving credit facility in the Original Credit Agreement to $350.0 million from $200.0 million, (ii) increase the amount of the letter of credit subfacility in the Original Credit Agreement to $50.0 million from $25.0 million, (iii) eliminated the swing line subfacility in the amount of up to $35.0 million in the Original Credit Agreement and (iv) reduced to $100.0 million from $250.0 million the amount of additional incremental revolving or term loans in the Original Credit Agreement. All other terms and conditions of the Credit Facilities remained essentially the same.\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to facilitate its ability to consummate the acquisition of Audience, which became effective upon the closing of the transaction. The amendment, among other things (i) amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the credit agreement to allow the Company to make certain adjustments attributable to cash items in excess of the 15% cap set forth therein for any fiscal quarter occurring in the fiscal year 2014 (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities), (ii) provided that pro forma calculations with respect to the acquisition (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities) shall disregard the consolidated EBITDA attributable to Audience for all periods prior to the first day of the first fiscal quarter following the acquisition and (iii) provided that all calculations as to whether the acquisition is a Permitted Acquisition\u201d under the credit agreement will be made as of the date of the agreement, but after giving effect to the amendment.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to its Credit Agreement in which it amended the definition of change in control\u201d to allow the incumbent board to approve a slate of directors.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to its Credit Agreement in connection with the Company's decision to sell the speakers and receivers product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment. The third amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the Credit Agreement to allow adjustments for (i) the amount by which consolidated net income has been reduced by net losses attributable to the \"Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations\" (defined as the operations (including assets held for sale) comprising the speaker and receiver product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment that have been disposed of, abandoned or discontinued or which are being held for sale) for any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2016 and (ii) cash costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations on or prior to March 31, 2017, with an aggregate cap on adjustments attributable to such cash costs and expenses of $45.0 million; provided that, in each case, such adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations shall be disregarded in calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The third amendment also includes permanent reduction by the Company of the aggregate revolving commitment under the Credit Agreement from $350.0 million to $300.0 million.\nUp to $100.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings in euros, British pounds sterling and other currencies requested by us and agreed to by the lenders.\nLoans outstanding under the term facility will mature on January 27, 2019 and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in annual amounts (expressed as percentages of the loans made under the term facility on the initial funding date of the term facility, which was February 28, 2014) as set forth below, with the remaining balance due on the final maturity date of the term facility.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year after debt execution date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Annum Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have the right to prepay borrowings under the facilities and to reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in each case, at any time without premium or penalty (except for Eurodollar breakage fees, if any). We are required to prepay borrowings under the term facility with 100% of the net cash proceeds of sales or dispositions of assets or other property (including, among others, the proceeds of issuances of equity interests by subsidiaries), subject to certain reinvestment rights and other exceptions. The interest rates under the facilities are variable based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate at the time of the borrowing and our leverage as measured by a consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio and initially are set at LIBOR plus 1.50%. A commitment fee will accrue on the average daily unused portion of the revolving facility at the rate of 0.2% to 0.4%, initially set at 0.25%. As we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates based on the structure of our Credit Facilities, we entered into an interest rate swap on November 12, 2014 to convert variable interest rate payments into a fixed rate on a notional amount of $100.0 million of debt for monthly interest payments starting in January 2016 and ending in July 2018.\nThe facilities contain customary covenants, which include, among others, limitations or restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and entry into sales and leaseback transactions, mergers, transfers of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and certain transactions limiting the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The facilities also include a requirement, to be tested quarterly, that we maintain both (i) a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.25 to 1.0 and (ii) a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of 3.25 to 1.0. For these ratios, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated interest expense are calculated in a manner defined in the debt agreement. The facilities include customary events of defaults. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nRisk Management\nWe are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our ongoing business operations, including changes in currency exchange rates, the dependence on key customers and price volatility for certain commodities. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exposure\nWe conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, could result in increased foreign exchange exposures. A weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but would be beneficial to the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. A strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would positively affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but adversely would have a negative effect on the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily driven by changes in the Chinese renminbi (yuan), the euro, the Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso. Based on our current sales and manufacturing activity, a sustained 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar for a period of one year would reduce our operating results by approximately $44.1 million pre-tax.\nDependence on Key Customers; Concentration of Credit\nThe loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Apple, Inc. accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 20% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 25% and 15% of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during these periods. If a key customer fails to meet payment obligations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing for various precious metals, such as palladium and gold, and rare earth\u201d materials (dysprosium and neodymium), fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.\nInterest Rates\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting our external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2015 would be $3.3 million on a pre-tax basis. In 2014, we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on $100.0 million of our outstanding debt. The swap is effective in January 2016 and matures in July 2018, and the interest rate expense on the $100.0 million will be approximately $1.8 million on a pre-tax basis for the year ending December 31, 2016. Changes to variable interest rates during January 2016 through July 2018 will not impact interest expenses on the notional amount of the swap.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of GAAP. GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss. We do not have significant service revenue, licensing income, or multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize third-party licensing or royalty income as revenue over the related contract term. Revenue is recognized net of customer discounts, rebates and returns. Rebates are recognized over the contract period based on expected revenue levels. Sales discounts and rebates totaled $9.9 million, $14.3 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Returns and allowances totaled $7.2 million, $10.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The value of inventory may decline as a result of surplus inventory, price reductions, or technological obsolescence. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of inventory when items have no future demand (obsolete inventory) and additionally, where inventory items on hand have demand, yet have insufficient forecasted activity to consume the entire stock within a reasonable period. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of such at-risk inventory items after considering the nature of the risk and any mitigating factors.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks) are not amortized. Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We conduct our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year with an evaluation date of October 1. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two-step process. We identified four reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment test. Step one of the test compares the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its book value. This method uses our market assumptions including projections of future cash flows, determinations of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis. The projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The fair value of all of our reporting units determined in step one exceeded the carrying values by at least 20%. A reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units could trigger an impairment in the future. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Step two, which compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one during any of the periods presented. Should our market capitalization fall below the book value of our total stockholders' equity and remain at that level for a sustained period, we could conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets are materially impaired, in which case, we would be required under GAAP to record a non-cash charge to our earnings, which could be a significant amount and adversely impact our financial results.\nSimilar to goodwill, in testing its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we use a relief from royalty method to calculate and compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value. This method estimates the fair value of trade names by calculating the present value of royalty income that could hypothetically be earned by licensing the trade name to a third party over the remaining useful life. Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles was indicated for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information on goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.\nOther Intangible and Long-Lived Assets: Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of unpatented technology, patents, trademarks customer relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years. We rely on patents and proprietary technology and seek patent protection for products and methods. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically 7 to 10 years. We assess the future economic benefit and/or the successful outcome of legal action related to patent defense involves considerable management judgment and a different outcome could result in material write-offs of the carrying value of these assets. Other intangible assets with determinable lives at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $65.0 million, $238.3 million and $286.3 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $0.5 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in legal costs related to the defense of our patents.\nLong-lived assets (including intangible assets with determinable lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We recorded Impairments of fixed and other assets of $53.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, we recorded Impairment of intangible assets of $144.7 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Balances: For purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been estimated as if we filed income tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from our Former Parent. As a stand-alone entity, our deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those of our Former Parent in the historical periods.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such assessments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires considerable judgment on the part of management with respect to the benefits that could be realized from future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors.\nWe have evaluated our deferred tax assets for each of the reporting periods, including an assessment of cumulative income over the prior three-year period. Since we are in a cumulative loss position in the United States, there is significant negative evidence that impairs the ability to rely on projections of future income. Due to a lack of significant positive evidence and cumulative losses in the respective prior three-year periods, a valuation allowance was required for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 periods.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Adjustments are made to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are believed to be appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were (6.1)%, 57.9% and (4.2)%, respectively.\nWe have not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes on the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, or the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\nAccruals and Reserves: We have accruals and reserves that require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using certain factors, which include but are not limited to, actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. Most recently, we have established liabilities for restructuring activities, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts.\nStock-Based Compensation: The principal awards issued under the stock-based compensation plans include stock options, restricted stock units and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (\"SSARs\"). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period and is included in Cost of goods sold, Research and development expenses and Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, depending on the functional area of the underlying employees.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SSARs and stock options granted to employees. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is equal to the share price at the date of the grant. At the time of grant, we estimate forfeitures, based on historical experience, in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. See Note 13. Equity Incentive Program of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to our stock-based compensation.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nManagement's discussion and analysis, which we refer to as MD&A,\u201d of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows should be read together with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" to provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. We believe the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been an independent publicly-traded company during all of the periods presented.\nOur Business\nWe are a market leader and global supplier of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing and specialty component solutions, serving the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, military, aerospace and industrial markets. We use our leading position in micro-electro-mechanical systems (\"MEMS\") microphones and strong capabilities in speaker, receiver and audio processing technologies to optimize audio systems and improve the user experience in smartphones, tablets and wearables. We are also the leader in acoustics components used in hearing aids and have a strong position in high-end oscillators (timing devices) and capacitors. Our focus on our customers, combined with our unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, rigorous testing and global scale, enables us to deliver innovative solutions that optimize the user experience.\nOur Business Segments\nWe are organized into two reportable segments based on how management analyzes performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions. These segments were determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are comprised of (i) Mobile Consumer Electronics ( MCE\u201d) and (ii) Specialty Components ( SC\u201d). The segments are aligned around similar product applications serving our key end markets, to enhance focus on end market growth strategies.\n \u2022 MCE designs and manufactures innovative acoustic products, including microphones, speakers, receivers, integrated modules and audio processing technologies used in several applications that serve the handset, tablet and other consumer electronic markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities in North America, Europe and Asia; and manufacturing facilities in Asia. \n \u2022 SC specializes in the design and manufacture of specialized electronic components used in medical and life science applications, as well as high-performance solutions and components used in communications infrastructure and a wide variety of other markets. SC's transducer products are used principally in hearing aid applications within the commercial audiology markets, while its oscillator products predominantly serve the telecom infrastructure market and its capacitor products are used in applications including radio, radar, satellite, power supplies, transceivers and medical implants serving the defense, aerospace, telecommunication and life sciences markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities are located in North America, Europe and Asia. \nWe sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and to a lesser extent through distributors worldwide.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock ( Shares\u201d) of Audience, Inc. (\"Audience\"), a leading provider of intelligent voice and audio solutions that improve voice quality and the user experience in mobile devices. For additional information on the Audience acquisition, refer to Note 2. Acquisition of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 11, 2016, we announced our intent to sell the speaker and receiver product line in our mobile consumer electronics segment. While we've made operational improvements to this product line over the past several years, we do not believe this product line can leverage our long-term investment in semiconductor and software design capabilities. By exiting this product line, we anticipate meaningful improvements to our overall gross and operating margins while reducing capital expenditure investments and improving free cash flow.\nAs a result, the Company expects to reclassify the assets, liabilities and results of the operations of the product line to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2016. Knowles has not entered into any definitive agreement for the sale of the product line and there can be no assurance that Knowles will complete a sale in a timely manner or at all.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, Knowles recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191.5 million resulting from the carrying value of the speaker and receiver product line's net assets being less than their fair-market value.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the speaker and receiver product line had revenues of $235.0 million and losses before income taxes of $272.4 million.\nResults of Operations\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements and segment information were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Dover's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. Accordingly, our financial statements prior to February 28, 2014 are presented herein on a consolidated basis and reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows of our business operated as part of Dover prior to the Separation, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d or U.S. GAAP\u201d). The Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future, or what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had Knowles been a stand-alone company during all the periods presented.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared with the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures included herein, we have presented certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP measures as supplements to our GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of our business and our Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of our performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist us in comparing our performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance.\nThe Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation included herein.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions, except per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,084.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,141.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,214.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>450.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP gross profit as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(236.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(48.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>222.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP (benefit from) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(233.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) earnings per share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.02\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) On July 1, 2015, the Company issued 3.2 million shares to former holders of Audience shares and for the conversion of vested in-the-money Audience stock options. The Company also converted unvested in-the-money Audience stock options and restricted stock units for an aggregate of 461,371 shares of its common stock. On February 28, 2014, Dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2014 received one share of Knowles common stock for every two shares of Dover's common stock held as of the record date. The computation of diluted earnings per common share for 2013 was calculated using the number of shares distributed on February 28, 2014. See Note 18. Earnings per Share of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding earnings per share.\nRevenues\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,084.6 million, compared with $1,141.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $56.7 million or 5.0%. This was due to a decrease in SC revenues and MCE revenues of $29.3 million and $27.4 million, respectively. SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China long-term evolution (\"LTE\") infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products. MCE revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\n2014 Versus 2013\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1,141.3 million, compared with $1,214.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $73.5 million or 6.1%. This was due to a decrease in MCE revenues of $93.1 million, partially offset by an increase in SC revenues of $19.5 million. MCE revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in MCE revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2103 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. The decreases in MCE revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year. The increase in SC revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, SC revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in SC revenues were partially offset by lower pricing. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\nCost of Goods Sold\n2015 Versus 2014\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $785.1 million, compared with $883.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $98.8 million or 11.2%. This decrease was driven by numerous factors. We had lower fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges associated with the prior year cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility (the \"Vienna action\") and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. In addition, we incurred inventory charges in the prior year related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. In the current year, we had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and cost savings from the Vienna action. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable fixed overhead absorption expenses and the impacts from increased shipping volume, which includes $12.6 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $883.9 million, compared with $775.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $108.4 million or 14.0%. The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges of $32.6 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. The increase was also due to warranty and inventory charges, as well as unfavorable fixed overhead absorption related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. Lastly, the increase was due to higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lost shipments of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and cost savings from restructuring actions.\nImpairment of Fixed and Other Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $48.2 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as we have concluded that the product line lacks a future path to profitability. On February 11, 2016 we announced our intention to sell this product line during 2016. In addition, the MCE and SC business segments recorded other impairment charges in connection with restructuring actions of $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of fixed and other assets.\nDuring 2014, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the MCE business segment.\nDuring 2013, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the SC business segment.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe undertake restructuring programs from time to time to better align our operations with current market conditions. Such activities include targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures to further optimize operations. It is likely that we will have restructuring charges in the future as we execute on our strategy to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. Details regarding restructuring programs undertaken during the reporting period are as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million, comprised primarily of the $9.5 million of restructuring expenses associated with the integration of Audience. The remaining charges primarily relate to the continued transfer of our capacitor business into lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility as part of our previously announced plan to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. As a result of the Vienna action, which was substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $20.7 million. This included $16.0 million related to severance pay and benefits and $4.7 million related to contract termination and other costs. Of the total $20.7 million in restructuring charges, $14.5 million were classified as Cost of goods sold and $6.2 million were classified as Operating expenses.\nIn conjunction with this restructuring action, we also accelerated depreciation on fixed assets and recorded inventory charges of $18.8 million and incurred production transfer costs of $6.2 million, bringing the total recorded costs related to the Vienna restructuring action to $45.7 million.\nIn line with our previously announced plans to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, we also recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 million during year ended December 31, 2014 related to other actions. These actions included programs to transfer our hearing health business and certain of our capacitor businesses into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities, as well as to reduce headcount in the consumer electronics business.\nIn 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $16.3 million relating to programs to integrate activities within the consumer electronics business, to migrate the Company's U.K.-based capacitor production into our existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and to reduce headcount within our German and North American operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market in order to better align the business with current market dynamics.\nGross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit\n2015 Versus 2014\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $242.5 million, compared with $232.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.8 million or 4.2%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 22.4%, compared with 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by: lower fixed asset and inventory charges as described above, lower restructuring and production transfer costs and the cost savings from such actions. In the current year, the Company had benefits from an increase in shipping volume, which includes the $6.3 million associated with our acquired Audience operations, as well as favorable impacts from productivity initiatives and foreign currency translations. These improvements were partially offset by lower average selling prices, increased impairment charges, higher fixed overhead absorption expenses and unfavorable product mix.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $320.7 million, compared with $335.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $15.1 million or 4.5%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 29.6%, as compared with 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower average selling prices, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower inventory charges in the current year, benefits from productivity initiatives, favorable foreign currency translations and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $232.7 million, compared with $427.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $195.2 million or 45.6%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 20.4%, compared with 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $48.1 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $335.8 million, compared with $450.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $114.3 million or 25.4%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 29.4%, as compared with 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $112.1 million and $83.0 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 10.3% and 7.3%, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily driven by our recently acquired Audience research and development operations of $21.5 million, lower revenue and an increase in new product development spending.\n2014 Versus 2013\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $83.0 million and $82.6 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 7.3% and 6.8%, respectively.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $208.1 million, compared with $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million or 5.9%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 19.2%, compared with 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was mainly due to our recently acquired Audience operations of $19.6 million, lower revenue and transaction-related expenses incurred related to the acquisition of Audience, partially offset by lower legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $196.5 million, compared with $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.5 million or 1.8%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 17.2%, compared with 15.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in selling and administrative expenses were corporate allocations from our Former Parent of $3.4 million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represent administration of treasury, employee compensation and benefits, public and investor relations, internal audit, corporate income tax, supply chain and legal services through the Separation date. In 2014, we also incurred our own costs related to such support functions as part of being an independent company for the majority of the year. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $143.3 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as the product line lacked a future path to profitability. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of intangible assets.\n(Loss) Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(236.2) million, compared with $(48.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $187.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of intangibles of $144.7 million and $43.8 million of expenses from our recently acquired Audience operations, which includes $9.5 million of restructuring expenses, partially offset by reduced legal expenses and higher GAAP gross profit.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $66.6 million, compared with $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $46.8 million or 41.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.1%, as compared with 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These declines were primarily due to lower non-GAAP gross profit and higher non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.3 million, which primarily relate to our recently acquired Audience operations. The decrease was partially offset by reduced legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $(48.5) million, compared with $143.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $192.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $45.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Additionally, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $16.1 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $113.4 million, compared with $222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $108.9 million or 49.0%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 9.9%, as compared with 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nInterest Expense, net\n2015 Versus 2014\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $12.7 million, compared with $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.1 million or 92.4%. The increase in interest expense was due to a combination of a higher average debt balance outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to a draw down from our revolving credit facility to fund the Audience acquisition and higher interest rates. Additionally, during 2015 we had twelve months of interest expense for our Credit facilities compared to only ten months of interest expense during 2014. We incurred $400.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities on February 28, 2014.\n2014 Versus 2013\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, compared with $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $35.4 million or 84.3%. During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into five-year credit facilities totaling $500.0 million and borrowed $400.0 million on February 28, 2014 to finance a cash payment to Dover in connection with the Separation. The interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to these borrowings. The interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2013 relates to interest expense on the net notes payable to Dover that were settled during the fourth quarter of 2013 in anticipation of the Separation.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes and Non-GAAP (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nThe effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a 6.1% benefit, compared with a 57.9% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the ETR is due primarily to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by two tax holidays granted to us by Malaysia effective through December 31, 2021, offset unfavorably by the impact of valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions (United States (\"U.S.\"), Austria and China). For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31,2015 was a 5.4% benefit, compared with an 11.7% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss, the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia, and judgments as to the realizability of our deferred tax assets. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021. The U.S. and Austrian operations were in cumulative loss positions as of December 31, 2015. Based on this, the speaker and receiver product line asset impairments, and other relevant information, the Company concluded that tax losses and deferred assets generated in the U.S. and Austria would not be benefited currently or in the future.\n2014 Versus 2013\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements reflect income tax expense and deferred tax balances that have been calculated on a stand-alone basis although our operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by our Former Parent.\nThe ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a 57.9% provision, compared with a 4.2% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by net discrete items of $38.2 million. The discrete items recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by a Malaysian tax holiday of $4.4 million. The discrete benefit from the Malaysian tax holiday relates to 2013; however, it was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 when we received approval from the relevant taxing authority. For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". Absent the discrete items, the ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.4% benefit, compared with a 6.4% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the ETR, excluding the discrete items, was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.7% provision, compared with an 8.0% provision for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss and the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021.\nDiluted (Loss) Earnings per Share and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share\n2015 Versus 2014\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(2.69) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT, partially offset by income tax benefits.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.65, compared with $1.10 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT.\n2014 Versus 2013\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $1.24 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT and the impact of a discrete tax expense resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $35.4 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.10, compared with $1.95 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.05 related to the discrete Malaysia tax holiday benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense.\nReconciliation

Knowles uses non-GAAP measures as supplements to its GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of its business, and its Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist Knowles in comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(2) Production Transfer Costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to new or existing facilities in Asia.

Revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE revenues were $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $777.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $93.1 million or 12.0%. Revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level product defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nMCE operating loss was $(239.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease in earnings of $165.2 million. The decrease was due primarily to intangible and fixed asset impairments in the speaker and receiver product line of $191.5 million, as it lacked a future path to profitability. In addition, MCE's decrease was affected by lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $41.1 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations and related restructuring actions of $9.5 million. In addition, MCE had unfavorable fixed overhead absorption and product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower restructuring and related charges from the Vienna actions as well as cost savings from the Vienna action. MCE also experienced an increase in revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption. In addition, MCE had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $31.3 million or 66.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.4%, compared with 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $30.3 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower impacts from the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold in 2014, cost savings from the Vienna action, favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE operating (loss) earnings were $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $197.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges, restructuring charges and production transfer costs of $55.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from the Vienna restructuring action.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $171.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $124.7 million or 72.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9%, compared with 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold, ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.

SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China LTE infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC revenues were $457.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $437.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $19.5 million or 4.5%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower pricing.\nOperating Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nSC operating earnings were $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $8.8 million or 12.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $10.7 million or 10.4%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 21.6%, compared with 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC operating earnings were $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $5.0 million or 7.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes, cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing and higher production transfer costs of $7.5 million, mainly driven by the transfer of our hearing health business into a new, lower-cost Asian manufacturing facility.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.8 million or 10.5%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 22.6%, compared with 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense, partially offset by lower pricing.\nFinancial Condition\nHistorically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. As a result of the Separation, we no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with our Former Parent. Historically, we have utilized these arrangements to fund significant expenditures, such as manufacturing capacity expansion and acquisitions. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. We believe that our future cash flow from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our working capital needs, dividends (if any), capital expenditures and strategic investments. We have secured a revolving line of credit in the United States from a syndicate of commercial banks to provide additional liquidity. Furthermore, if we were to require additional cash in the United States above and beyond our domestic cash on the balance sheet, the free cash flow generated by the domestic businesses and availability under our revolving credit facility, we would most likely seek to raise long-term financing through the U.S. debt or bank markets.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Audience. Under the terms of the transaction, we issued 3.2 million shares and paid $61.6 million in cash to former holders of Shares and for the settlement of vested Audience stock options. We funded the cash portion of the consideration through a draw down from our existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand. In addition, the amendment to our existing credit agreement to modify specific terms and conditions, including the definition of certain covenants to permit the acquisition, became effective upon the closing of the transaction.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including third party debt incurred in connection with the Separation, as well as any debt that we may incur in the future, will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash from operations, financings or asset sales and the tax consequences of our repatriation of overseas cash. Due to the global nature of our operations, a significant portion of our cash is held outside the Unites States. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $63.3 million and $55.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, cash held by our non-U.S. operations totaled $59.7 million and $53.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe hold the vast majority of our cash and operating cash flows outside the United States, since this cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our capital expenditures and growth plans, as our manufacturing locations are primarily based outside of the United States. We have not provided for U.S. income taxes on $1.8 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, because we intend to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the United States.\nWe generate cash flow in the United States primarily through ongoing product sales, management fees and royalty income and we utilize cash in the United States primarily for expenses relating to operations and corporate functions, including management, administration and research and development. We have generated approximately $15.4 million, $36.4 million and $43.7 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the United States, as defined below, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which has been sufficient to meet our domestic cash needs in each such year, as most of our capital expenditures and expenses occurred outside of the United States during those years. Adjusted operating cash flow in the United States is not presented in accordance with GAAP and is defined as operating cash flow generated within the United States, net of corporate expense allocations, but excluding net U.S. interest expense related to intercompany notes payable to our Former Parent of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The adjusted operating cash flow in the United States amounts exclude U.S. interest expense related to intercompany net notes payable to our Former Parent, as these notes were settled prior to the Separation and these amounts are not necessarily representative of interest payments related to our future debt. We project that our cash generation within the United States for the foreseeable future will be self-sustaining to meet all estimated U.S. expenditures and, as such, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy our domestic cash needs, including the service of any third party debt incurred in the United States.\nOur management will continue to reassess our need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nCash Flow Summary\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized in the following table:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(108.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased $37.1 million compared to 2014, primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower revenues. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly accrued other expenses and deferred taxes, decreased operating cash flows. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $18.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $58.8 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower revenues and increased restructuring and production transfer related expenses. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $32.2 million. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly deferred taxes and accrued other expenses, increased operating cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities results primarily from cash outflows for capital expenditures, the capitalization of patent defense costs and investment activity.\nCapital spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $63.1 million, $83.9 million and $105.2 million, or 5.8%, 7.4% and 8.7% as a percentage of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The large drivers of the capital expenditures have been related to investment in new product launches, the ongoing investment in MEMS manufacturing capacity expansion to support growth in the handset market as well as manufacturing footprint optimization projects. Construction and customization of a new manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines started in 2012 and continued throughout 2013. Fully operational in 2014, this 215,000 square foot facility supports several growth and productivity initiatives for us.\nCapitalization of patent defense costs. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically seven to ten years. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid $1.0 million, $16.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in gross legal costs related to the defense of our patents. Capitalized patent defense costs decreased in 2015 due primarily to lower legal expenses incurred in 2014 associated with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nAcquisitions and sales of investments. We paid $35.1 million, net of cash acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 to acquire Audience. We received proceeds of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from the sale of investments, which were part of the acquisition of Audience. We paid $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to acquire a non-controlling interest in a MEMS timing device company and subsequently received proceeds of $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 from the sale of our non-controlling interest in the same MEMS timing device company.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $45.0 million in additional net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the $15.0 million in scheduled principal payments on our term loan, whereas cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to cash payments to our Former Parent of $468.2 million as a result of the Separation, partially offset by $400.0 million in proceeds from debt. For additional information on our debt, see Note 11. Borrowings and Lines of Credit of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our management believes these measures are useful in measuring our cash generated from operations and cash generated from operations as a percentage of revenue that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase Knowles' common stock. Free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue are not presented in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. As such, free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nOur businesses tend to have stronger revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles due to the highly technical nature of the industries they serve, which can result in new OEM product launches that can impact quarterly revenues, earnings and cash flow.\nThe following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(105.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, we generated free cash flow of $15.3 million, representing 1.4% of revenue, compared to free cash flow in 2014 of $31.6 million, representing 2.8% of revenue and free cash flow in 2013 of $69.1 million, or 5.7% of revenue. The decrease in free cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to a reduction in earnings. The lower free cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a reduction in earnings.\nIn 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0% of revenue.\nContingent Obligations\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nA summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term and long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement benefits (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total obligations (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Primarily relates to the maturity of indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan due in January 2019.

See Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \nBorrowings and Lines of Credit\nOn January 27, 2014, we entered into a $200.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility, as well as a $300.0 million five-year senior secured term loan facility pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement, which are referred to collectively as the Credit Facilities.\u201d In connection with the Separation, we incurred $100.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $300.0 million of borrowings under the term loan facility, in each case to finance a cash payment to Dover immediately prior to the Separation.\nOn December 31, 2014, we amended our Credit Facilities to (i) increase the amount of the revolving credit facility in the Original Credit Agreement to $350.0 million from $200.0 million, (ii) increase the amount of the letter of credit subfacility in the Original Credit Agreement to $50.0 million from $25.0 million, (iii) eliminated the swing line subfacility in the amount of up to $35.0 million in the Original Credit Agreement and (iv) reduced to $100.0 million from $250.0 million the amount of additional incremental revolving or term loans in the Original Credit Agreement. All other terms and conditions of the Credit Facilities remained essentially the same.\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to facilitate its ability to consummate the acquisition of Audience, which became effective upon the closing of the transaction. The amendment, among other things (i) amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the credit agreement to allow the Company to make certain adjustments attributable to cash items in excess of the 15% cap set forth therein for any fiscal quarter occurring in the fiscal year 2014 (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities), (ii) provided that pro forma calculations with respect to the acquisition (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities) shall disregard the consolidated EBITDA attributable to Audience for all periods prior to the first day of the first fiscal quarter following the acquisition and (iii) provided that all calculations as to whether the acquisition is a Permitted Acquisition\u201d under the credit agreement will be made as of the date of the agreement, but after giving effect to the amendment.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to its Credit Agreement in which it amended the definition of change in control\u201d to allow the incumbent board to approve a slate of directors.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to its Credit Agreement in connection with the Company's decision to sell the speakers and receivers product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment. The third amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the Credit Agreement to allow adjustments for (i) the amount by which consolidated net income has been reduced by net losses attributable to the \"Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations\" (defined as the operations (including assets held for sale) comprising the speaker and receiver product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment that have been disposed of, abandoned or discontinued or which are being held for sale) for any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2016 and (ii) cash costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations on or prior to March 31, 2017, with an aggregate cap on adjustments attributable to such cash costs and expenses of $45.0 million; provided that, in each case, such adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations shall be disregarded in calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The third amendment also includes permanent reduction by the Company of the aggregate revolving commitment under the Credit Agreement from $350.0 million to $300.0 million.\nUp to $100.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings in euros, British pounds sterling and other currencies requested by us and agreed to by the lenders.\nLoans outstanding under the term facility will mature on January 27, 2019 and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in annual amounts (expressed as percentages of the loans made under the term facility on the initial funding date of the term facility, which was February 28, 2014) as set forth below, with the remaining balance due on the final maturity date of the term facility.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year after debt execution date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Annum Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have the right to prepay borrowings under the facilities and to reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in each case, at any time without premium or penalty (except for Eurodollar breakage fees, if any). We are required to prepay borrowings under the term facility with 100% of the net cash proceeds of sales or dispositions of assets or other property (including, among others, the proceeds of issuances of equity interests by subsidiaries), subject to certain reinvestment rights and other exceptions. The interest rates under the facilities are variable based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate at the time of the borrowing and our leverage as measured by a consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio and initially are set at LIBOR plus 1.50%. A commitment fee will accrue on the average daily unused portion of the revolving facility at the rate of 0.2% to 0.4%, initially set at 0.25%. As we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates based on the structure of our Credit Facilities, we entered into an interest rate swap on November 12, 2014 to convert variable interest rate payments into a fixed rate on a notional amount of $100.0 million of debt for monthly interest payments starting in January 2016 and ending in July 2018.\nThe facilities contain customary covenants, which include, among others, limitations or restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and entry into sales and leaseback transactions, mergers, transfers of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and certain transactions limiting the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The facilities also include a requirement, to be tested quarterly, that we maintain both (i) a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.25 to 1.0 and (ii) a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of 3.25 to 1.0. For these ratios, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated interest expense are calculated in a manner defined in the debt agreement. The facilities include customary events of defaults. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nRisk Management\nWe are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our ongoing business operations, including changes in currency exchange rates, the dependence on key customers and price volatility for certain commodities. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exposure\nWe conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, could result in increased foreign exchange exposures. A weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but would be beneficial to the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. A strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would positively affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but adversely would have a negative effect on the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily driven by changes in the Chinese renminbi (yuan), the euro, the Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso. Based on our current sales and manufacturing activity, a sustained 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar for a period of one year would reduce our operating results by approximately $44.1 million pre-tax.\nDependence on Key Customers; Concentration of Credit\nThe loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Apple, Inc. accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 20% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 25% and 15% of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during these periods. If a key customer fails to meet payment obligations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing for various precious metals, such as palladium and gold, and rare earth\u201d materials (dysprosium and neodymium), fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.\nInterest Rates\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting our external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2015 would be $3.3 million on a pre-tax basis. In 2014, we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on $100.0 million of our outstanding debt. The swap is effective in January 2016 and matures in July 2018, and the interest rate expense on the $100.0 million will be approximately $1.8 million on a pre-tax basis for the year ending December 31, 2016. Changes to variable interest rates during January 2016 through July 2018 will not impact interest expenses on the notional amount of the swap.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of GAAP. GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss. We do not have significant service revenue, licensing income, or multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize third-party licensing or royalty income as revenue over the related contract term. Revenue is recognized net of customer discounts, rebates and returns. Rebates are recognized over the contract period based on expected revenue levels. Sales discounts and rebates totaled $9.9 million, $14.3 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Returns and allowances totaled $7.2 million, $10.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The value of inventory may decline as a result of surplus inventory, price reductions, or technological obsolescence. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of inventory when items have no future demand (obsolete inventory) and additionally, where inventory items on hand have demand, yet have insufficient forecasted activity to consume the entire stock within a reasonable period. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of such at-risk inventory items after considering the nature of the risk and any mitigating factors.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks) are not amortized. Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We conduct our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year with an evaluation date of October 1. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two-step process. We identified four reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment test. Step one of the test compares the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its book value. This method uses our market assumptions including projections of future cash flows, determinations of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis. The projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The fair value of all of our reporting units determined in step one exceeded the carrying values by at least 20%. A reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units could trigger an impairment in the future. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Step two, which compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one during any of the periods presented. Should our market capitalization fall below the book value of our total stockholders' equity and remain at that level for a sustained period, we could conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets are materially impaired, in which case, we would be required under GAAP to record a non-cash charge to our earnings, which could be a significant amount and adversely impact our financial results.\nSimilar to goodwill, in testing its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we use a relief from royalty method to calculate and compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value. This method estimates the fair value of trade names by calculating the present value of royalty income that could hypothetically be earned by licensing the trade name to a third party over the remaining useful life. Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles was indicated for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information on goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.\nOther Intangible and Long-Lived Assets: Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of unpatented technology, patents, trademarks customer relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years. We rely on patents and proprietary technology and seek patent protection for products and methods. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically 7 to 10 years. We assess the future economic benefit and/or the successful outcome of legal action related to patent defense involves considerable management judgment and a different outcome could result in material write-offs of the carrying value of these assets. Other intangible assets with determinable lives at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $65.0 million, $238.3 million and $286.3 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $0.5 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in legal costs related to the defense of our patents.\nLong-lived assets (including intangible assets with determinable lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We recorded Impairments of fixed and other assets of $53.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, we recorded Impairment of intangible assets of $144.7 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Balances: For purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been estimated as if we filed income tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from our Former Parent. As a stand-alone entity, our deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those of our Former Parent in the historical periods.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such assessments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires considerable judgment on the part of management with respect to the benefits that could be realized from future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors.\nWe have evaluated our deferred tax assets for each of the reporting periods, including an assessment of cumulative income over the prior three-year period. Since we are in a cumulative loss position in the United States, there is significant negative evidence that impairs the ability to rely on projections of future income. Due to a lack of significant positive evidence and cumulative losses in the respective prior three-year periods, a valuation allowance was required for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 periods.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Adjustments are made to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are believed to be appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were (6.1)%, 57.9% and (4.2)%, respectively.\nWe have not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes on the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, or the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\nAccruals and Reserves: We have accruals and reserves that require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using certain factors, which include but are not limited to, actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. Most recently, we have established liabilities for restructuring activities, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts.\nStock-Based Compensation: The principal awards issued under the stock-based compensation plans include stock options, restricted stock units and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (\"SSARs\"). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period and is included in Cost of goods sold, Research and development expenses and Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, depending on the functional area of the underlying employees.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SSARs and stock options granted to employees. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is equal to the share price at the date of the grant. At the time of grant, we estimate forfeitures, based on historical experience, in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. See Note 13. Equity Incentive Program of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to our stock-based compensation.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nManagement's discussion and analysis, which we refer to as MD&A,\u201d of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows should be read together with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" to provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. We believe the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been an independent publicly-traded company during all of the periods presented.\nOur Business\nWe are a market leader and global supplier of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing and specialty component solutions, serving the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, military, aerospace and industrial markets. We use our leading position in micro-electro-mechanical systems (\"MEMS\") microphones and strong capabilities in speaker, receiver and audio processing technologies to optimize audio systems and improve the user experience in smartphones, tablets and wearables. We are also the leader in acoustics components used in hearing aids and have a strong position in high-end oscillators (timing devices) and capacitors. Our focus on our customers, combined with our unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, rigorous testing and global scale, enables us to deliver innovative solutions that optimize the user experience.\nOur Business Segments\nWe are organized into two reportable segments based on how management analyzes performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions. These segments were determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280 - Segment Reporting and are comprised of (i) Mobile Consumer Electronics ( MCE\u201d) and (ii) Specialty Components ( SC\u201d). The segments are aligned around similar product applications serving our key end markets, to enhance focus on end market growth strategies.\n \u2022 MCE designs and manufactures innovative acoustic products, including microphones, speakers, receivers, integrated modules and audio processing technologies used in several applications that serve the handset, tablet and other consumer electronic markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities in North America, Europe and Asia; and manufacturing facilities in Asia. \n \u2022 SC specializes in the design and manufacture of specialized electronic components used in medical and life science applications, as well as high-performance solutions and components used in communications infrastructure and a wide variety of other markets. SC's transducer products are used principally in hearing aid applications within the commercial audiology markets, while its oscillator products predominantly serve the telecom infrastructure market and its capacitor products are used in applications including radio, radar, satellite, power supplies, transceivers and medical implants serving the defense, aerospace, telecommunication and life sciences markets. Locations include the corporate office in Itasca, Illinois; sales, support and engineering facilities are located in North America, Europe and Asia. \nWe sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and to their contract manufacturers and suppliers and to a lesser extent through distributors worldwide.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock ( Shares\u201d) of Audience, Inc. (\"Audience\"), a leading provider of intelligent voice and audio solutions that improve voice quality and the user experience in mobile devices. For additional information on the Audience acquisition, refer to Note 2. Acquisition of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 11, 2016, we announced our intent to sell the speaker and receiver product line in our mobile consumer electronics segment. While we've made operational improvements to this product line over the past several years, we do not believe this product line can leverage our long-term investment in semiconductor and software design capabilities. By exiting this product line, we anticipate meaningful improvements to our overall gross and operating margins while reducing capital expenditure investments and improving free cash flow.\nAs a result, the Company expects to reclassify the assets, liabilities and results of the operations of the product line to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2016. Knowles has not entered into any definitive agreement for the sale of the product line and there can be no assurance that Knowles will complete a sale in a timely manner or at all.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, Knowles recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191.5 million resulting from the carrying value of the speaker and receiver product line's net assets being less than their fair-market value.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the speaker and receiver product line had revenues of $235.0 million and losses before income taxes of $272.4 million.\nResults of Operations\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements and segment information were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Dover's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. Accordingly, our financial statements prior to February 28, 2014 are presented herein on a consolidated basis and reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows of our business operated as part of Dover prior to the Separation, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d or U.S. GAAP\u201d). The Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future, or what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had Knowles been a stand-alone company during all the periods presented.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared with the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures included herein, we have presented certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP measures as supplements to our GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of our business and our Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of our performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist us in comparing our performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance.\nThe Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation included herein.\n\n(1) On July 1, 2015, the Company issued 3.2 million shares to former holders of Audience shares and for the conversion of vested in-the-money Audience stock options. The Company also converted unvested in-the-money Audience stock options and restricted stock units for an aggregate of 461,371 shares of its common stock. On February 28, 2014, Dover stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2014 received one share of Knowles common stock for every two shares of Dover's common stock held as of the record date. The computation of diluted earnings per common share for 2013 was calculated using the number of shares distributed on February 28, 2014. See Note 18. Earnings per Share of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding earnings per share.\nRevenues\n2015 Versus 2014\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1,084.6 million, compared with $1,141.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $56.7 million or 5.0%. This was due to a decrease in SC revenues and MCE revenues of $29.3 million and $27.4 million, respectively. SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China long-term evolution (\"LTE\") infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products. MCE revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\n2014 Versus 2013\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $1,141.3 million, compared with $1,214.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $73.5 million or 6.1%. This was due to a decrease in MCE revenues of $93.1 million, partially offset by an increase in SC revenues of $19.5 million. MCE revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in MCE revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2103 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. The decreases in MCE revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year. The increase in SC revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, SC revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in SC revenues were partially offset by lower pricing. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted consolidated revenues by a negligible amount.\nCost of Goods Sold\n2015 Versus 2014\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $785.1 million, compared with $883.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $98.8 million or 11.2%. This decrease was driven by numerous factors. We had lower fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges associated with the prior year cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility (the \"Vienna action\") and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. In addition, we incurred inventory charges in the prior year related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. In the current year, we had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and cost savings from the Vienna action. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable fixed overhead absorption expenses and the impacts from increased shipping volume, which includes $12.6 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nCost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $883.9 million, compared with $775.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $108.4 million or 14.0%. The increase was primarily driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges of $32.6 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. The increase was also due to warranty and inventory charges, as well as unfavorable fixed overhead absorption related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. Lastly, the increase was due to higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lost shipments of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and cost savings from restructuring actions.\nImpairment of Fixed and Other Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $48.2 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as we have concluded that the product line lacks a future path to profitability. On February 11, 2016 we announced our intention to sell this product line during 2016. In addition, the MCE and SC business segments recorded other impairment charges in connection with restructuring actions of $3.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of fixed and other assets.\nDuring 2014, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the MCE business segment.\nDuring 2013, impairment charges were recorded in connection with restructuring actions within the SC business segment.\nRestructuring Charges\nWe undertake restructuring programs from time to time to better align our operations with current market conditions. Such activities include targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures to further optimize operations. It is likely that we will have restructuring charges in the future as we execute on our strategy to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. Details regarding restructuring programs undertaken during the reporting period are as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million, comprised primarily of the $9.5 million of restructuring expenses associated with the integration of Audience. The remaining charges primarily relate to the continued transfer of our capacitor business into lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility as part of our previously announced plan to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. As a result of the Vienna action, which was substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $20.7 million. This included $16.0 million related to severance pay and benefits and $4.7 million related to contract termination and other costs. Of the total $20.7 million in restructuring charges, $14.5 million were classified as Cost of goods sold and $6.2 million were classified as Operating expenses.\nIn conjunction with this restructuring action, we also accelerated depreciation on fixed assets and recorded inventory charges of $18.8 million and incurred production transfer costs of $6.2 million, bringing the total recorded costs related to the Vienna restructuring action to $45.7 million.\nIn line with our previously announced plans to consolidate our manufacturing footprint, we also recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 million during year ended December 31, 2014 related to other actions. These actions included programs to transfer our hearing health business and certain of our capacitor businesses into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities, as well as to reduce headcount in the consumer electronics business.\nIn 2013, we incurred restructuring charges of $16.3 million relating to programs to integrate activities within the consumer electronics business, to migrate the Company's U.K.-based capacitor production into our existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and to reduce headcount within our German and North American operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market in order to better align the business with current market dynamics.\nGross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Profit\n2015 Versus 2014\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $242.5 million, compared with $232.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $9.8 million or 4.2%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 22.4%, compared with 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by: lower fixed asset and inventory charges as described above, lower restructuring and production transfer costs and the cost savings from such actions. In the current year, the Company had benefits from an increase in shipping volume, which includes the $6.3 million associated with our acquired Audience operations, as well as favorable impacts from productivity initiatives and foreign currency translations. These improvements were partially offset by lower average selling prices, increased impairment charges, higher fixed overhead absorption expenses and unfavorable product mix.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $320.7 million, compared with $335.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $15.1 million or 4.5%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 29.6%, as compared with 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower average selling prices, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower inventory charges in the current year, benefits from productivity initiatives, favorable foreign currency translations and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $232.7 million, compared with $427.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $195.2 million or 45.6%. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 20.4%, compared with 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $48.1 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $15.6 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nNon-GAAP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $335.8 million, compared with $450.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $114.3 million or 25.4%. Non-GAAP gross profit margin (non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 29.4%, as compared with 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $112.1 million and $83.0 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 10.3% and 7.3%, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily driven by our recently acquired Audience research and development operations of $21.5 million, lower revenue and an increase in new product development spending.\n2014 Versus 2013\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $83.0 million and $82.6 million, respectively. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 7.3% and 6.8%, respectively.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n2015 Versus 2014\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $208.1 million, compared with $196.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.6 million or 5.9%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were 19.2%, compared with 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was mainly due to our recently acquired Audience operations of $19.6 million, lower revenue and transaction-related expenses incurred related to the acquisition of Audience, partially offset by lower legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled and cost savings from the Vienna action.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSelling and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $196.5 million, compared with $193.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.5 million or 1.8%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were 17.2%, compared with 15.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Included in selling and administrative expenses were corporate allocations from our Former Parent of $3.4 million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represent administration of treasury, employee compensation and benefits, public and investor relations, internal audit, corporate income tax, supply chain and legal services through the Separation date. In 2014, we also incurred our own costs related to such support functions as part of being an independent company for the majority of the year. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased legal expenses primarily in connection with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nDuring 2015, an impairment charge of $143.3 million was recorded for the speaker and receiver product line within the MCE business segment as the product line lacked a future path to profitability. Refer to Note 4. Impairment of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for information regarding impairments of intangible assets.\n(Loss) Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(236.2) million, compared with $(48.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $187.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of intangibles of $144.7 million and $43.8 million of expenses from our recently acquired Audience operations, which includes $9.5 million of restructuring expenses, partially offset by reduced legal expenses and higher GAAP gross profit.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $66.6 million, compared with $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $46.8 million or 41.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 6.1%, as compared with 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. These declines were primarily due to lower non-GAAP gross profit and higher non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.3 million, which primarily relate to our recently acquired Audience operations. The decrease was partially offset by reduced legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nEBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $(48.5) million, compared with $143.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $192.0 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges and restructuring charges of $45.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Additionally, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, higher production transfer costs of $16.1 million to support the migration of operations into new and existing lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities and a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nAdjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $113.4 million, compared with $222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $108.9 million or 49.0%. Adjusted EBIT margin (adjusted EBIT as a percentage of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 9.9%, as compared with 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold and ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from overall restructuring actions.\nInterest Expense, net\n2015 Versus 2014\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $12.7 million, compared with $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.1 million or 92.4%. The increase in interest expense was due to a combination of a higher average debt balance outstanding in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to a draw down from our revolving credit facility to fund the Audience acquisition and higher interest rates. Additionally, during 2015 we had twelve months of interest expense for our Credit facilities compared to only ten months of interest expense during 2014. We incurred $400.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities on February 28, 2014.\n2014 Versus 2013\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.6 million, compared with $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $35.4 million or 84.3%. During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into five-year credit facilities totaling $500.0 million and borrowed $400.0 million on February 28, 2014 to finance a cash payment to Dover in connection with the Separation. The interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to these borrowings. The interest expense, net during the year ended December 31, 2013 relates to interest expense on the net notes payable to Dover that were settled during the fourth quarter of 2013 in anticipation of the Separation.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes and Non-GAAP (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nThe effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a 6.1% benefit, compared with a 57.9% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the ETR is due primarily to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2015 was favorably impacted by two tax holidays granted to us by Malaysia effective through December 31, 2021, offset unfavorably by the impact of valuation allowances recorded in certain jurisdictions (United States (\"U.S.\"), Austria and China). For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31,2015 was a 5.4% benefit, compared with an 11.7% provision for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss, the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia, and judgments as to the realizability of our deferred tax assets. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021. The U.S. and Austrian operations were in cumulative loss positions as of December 31, 2015. Based on this, the speaker and receiver product line asset impairments, and other relevant information, the Company concluded that tax losses and deferred assets generated in the U.S. and Austria would not be benefited currently or in the future.\n2014 Versus 2013\nPrior to the Separation on February 28, 2014, our historical financial statements reflect income tax expense and deferred tax balances that have been calculated on a stand-alone basis although our operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by our Former Parent.\nThe ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a 57.9% provision, compared with a 4.2% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by net discrete items of $38.2 million. The discrete items recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by a Malaysian tax holiday of $4.4 million. The discrete benefit from the Malaysian tax holiday relates to 2013; however, it was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 when we received approval from the relevant taxing authority. For additional information on this tax holiday, see Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\". Absent the discrete items, the ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.4% benefit, compared with a 6.4% benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the ETR, excluding the discrete items, was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe non-GAAP ETR for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an 11.7% provision, compared with an 8.0% provision for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in the non-GAAP ETR was due to the mix of earnings by taxing jurisdictions.\nThe year-to-date ETR and non-GAAP ETR deviates from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate, mainly due to the taxing jurisdictions in which we generate taxable income or loss and the favorable impact of our tax holidays in Malaysia. A significant portion of our pre-tax income is not subject to tax as a result of our tax holidays in Malaysia, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions that we expect to continue to satisfy. Unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, our existing tax holidays in Malaysia will expire December 31, 2021.\nDiluted (Loss) Earnings per Share and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share\n2015 Versus 2014\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(2.69) for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT, partially offset by income tax benefits.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.65, compared with $1.10 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT.\n2014 Versus 2013\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share was $(1.02) for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $1.24 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in diluted (loss) earnings per share was due to lower EBIT and the impact of a discrete tax expense resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries' net deferred tax assets of $36.8 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $35.4 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.10, compared with $1.95 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.05 related to the discrete Malaysia tax holiday benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, the decrease in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was mainly driven by lower adjusted EBIT, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense.\nReconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (1)\n\n(1) In addition to the GAAP financial measures included herein, Knowles has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures. Knowles uses non-GAAP measures as supplements to its GAAP results of operations in evaluating certain aspects of its business, and its Board of Directors and executive management team focus on non-GAAP items as key measures of Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. These measures assist Knowles in comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(2) Production Transfer Costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to new or existing facilities in Asia. These amounts are included in the corresponding Gross profit, Selling and administrative expenses, Operating expenses and Loss before interest and income taxes for each period presented.\n(3) In 2015, \"Other\" in Gross profit and Operating expenses represent expenses related to the Audience acquisition. In 2014, \"Other\" in Gross profit represents a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. In 2014, \"Other\" in Operating expenses represents expenses related to the spin-off of Knowles from Dover Corporation.\n(4) The Non-GAAP reconciling adjustments are those adjustments made to reconcile Loss before interest and income taxes to Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes.\n(5) Diluted average shares outstanding are consistent with basic average shares outstanding as all periods are reporting a net loss.\n(6) The number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations on a non-GAAP basis excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.\nSegment Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014 and the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nMobile Consumer Electronics\n Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 Percent of Revenues 2014 Percent of Revenues 2013 Percent of Revenues Revenues $ 656.7 $ 684.1 $ 777.2 Operating (loss) earnings $ (239.9 ) (36.5)% $ (74.7 ) (10.9)% $ 122.5 15.8% Other expense (income), net 0.9 (0.1 ) 0.5 (Loss) earnings before interest and income taxes $ (240.8 ) (36.7)% $ (74.6 ) (10.9)% $ 122.0 15.7% Stock-based compensation expense 5.6 1.6 0.3 Intangibles amortization expense 30.9 31.0 31.3 Fixed asset, inventory and other charges 54.4 39.5 6.9 Restructuring charges 13.2 22.0 7.3 Impairment of intangibles 144.7 - - Production transfer costs (1) 4.8 12.4 3.8 Other (2) 2.8 15.0 - Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes $ 15.6 2.4% $ 46.9 6.9% $ 171.6 22.1% (1) Production transfer costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to new or existing facilities in Asia. These amounts are included in (loss) earnings before interest and income taxes for each period presented. (2) In 2015, Other represents expenses related to the Audience acquisition. In 2014, Other represents a charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced. \nRevenues\n2015 Versus 2014\nMCE revenues were $656.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $27.4 million or 4.0%. Revenues decreased due to lower average selling prices, a decrease in shipments to a Korean OEM customer in connection with its lower share of the handset market and softness at a major OEM customer in connection with its transition to a new operating system. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in MCE revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption, as well as revenues of $19.0 million associated with our recently acquired Audience operations.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE revenues were $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $777.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $93.1 million or 12.0%. Revenues were negatively impacted by a hold on production and shipments of one new version of our MEMS microphone for a specific platform at one key OEM customer due to a low level product defect beginning in the third quarter of 2014. In February 2015, the OEM customer provided us notification that our microphone for this platform was requalified. The decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also due to lower average selling prices on mature products, reduced shipments to three OEM customers in connection with their lower share of the handset market and a design change at one smartphone OEM customer. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from other mobile customers, including Chinese OEMs, who gained market share year-over-year.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nMCE operating loss was $(239.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease in earnings of $165.2 million. The decrease was due primarily to intangible and fixed asset impairments in the speaker and receiver product line of $191.5 million, as it lacked a future path to profitability. In addition, MCE's decrease was affected by lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $41.1 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations and related restructuring actions of $9.5 million. In addition, MCE had unfavorable fixed overhead absorption and product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower restructuring and related charges from the Vienna actions as well as cost savings from the Vienna action. MCE also experienced an increase in revenues due to increased shipments of MEMS microphones, speakers and receivers, driven by market share gains at one key OEM customer and multiple microphone adoption. In addition, MCE had favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $31.3 million or 66.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.4%, compared with 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices, higher operating expenses of $30.3 million related to our recently acquired Audience operations, lower fixed overhead absorption and unfavorable product mix. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by lower impacts from the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold in 2014, cost savings from the Vienna action, favorable impacts from foreign currency translations, benefits from productivity initiatives and lower legal expenses.\n2014 Versus 2013\nMCE operating (loss) earnings were $(74.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $122.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $197.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products and lost production and shipments, as well as warranty and inventory charges, related to the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold. The decrease in operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was also driven by higher fixed asset accelerated depreciation and related inventory charges, restructuring charges and production transfer costs of $55.9 million, mainly associated with the cessation of manufacturing operations at our Vienna, Austria facility and shorter product life cycles at our Beijing, China facility. Lastly, the decrease was due to ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions, a $15.0 million charge related to the resolution of customer claims for products no longer produced and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from the Vienna restructuring action.\nMCE adjusted EBIT was $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $171.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $124.7 million or 72.7%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 6.9%, compared with 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices on mature products, the impacts of the MEMS microphone that was placed on hold, ramp-up costs associated with new product introductions and increased legal expenses primarily in conjunction with intellectual property litigation which has been settled. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by cost savings from the Vienna restructuring action.\nSpecialty Components\n\nRevenues\n2015 Versus 2014\nSC revenues were $427.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $457.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.3 million or 6.4%. SC revenues decreased due to lower pricing and a reduction in timing device shipments in connection with the reduction in China LTE infrastructure build-outs, partially offset by increased demand for new acoustic product introductions and broad-based demand among our capacitor products.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC revenues were $457.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $437.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $19.5 million or 4.5%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to improved demand for precision devices as a result of strength in the wireless communication infrastructure market, particularly in China, as well as increased market penetration. In addition, revenues increased due to new product introductions and broad-based demand among our hearing health customers. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower pricing.\nOperating Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes\n2015 Versus 2014\nSC operating earnings were $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $8.8 million or 12.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $10.7 million or 10.4%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 21.6%, compared with 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower pricing and unfavorable fixed overhead absorption, partially offset by the benefits from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and realized cost savings from our production transfers to lower-cost Asian manufacturing facilities.\n2014 Versus 2013\nSC operating earnings were $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $5.0 million or 7.8%. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes, cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing and higher production transfer costs of $7.5 million, mainly driven by the transfer of our hearing health business into a new, lower-cost Asian manufacturing facility.\nSC adjusted EBIT was $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared with $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.8 million or 10.5%. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 22.6%, compared with 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the prior year and lower intangibles amortization expense, partially offset by lower pricing.\nFinancial Condition\nHistorically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations. As a result of the Separation, we no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with our Former Parent. Historically, we have utilized these arrangements to fund significant expenditures, such as manufacturing capacity expansion and acquisitions. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. We believe that our future cash flow from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our working capital needs, dividends (if any), capital expenditures and strategic investments. We have secured a revolving line of credit in the United States from a syndicate of commercial banks to provide additional liquidity. Furthermore, if we were to require additional cash in the United States above and beyond our domestic cash on the balance sheet, the free cash flow generated by the domestic businesses and availability under our revolving credit facility, we would most likely seek to raise long-term financing through the U.S. debt or bank markets.\nOn July 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Audience. Under the terms of the transaction, we issued 3.2 million shares and paid $61.6 million in cash to former holders of Shares and for the settlement of vested Audience stock options. We funded the cash portion of the consideration through a draw down from our existing revolving credit facility and cash on hand. In addition, the amendment to our existing credit agreement to modify specific terms and conditions, including the definition of certain covenants to permit the acquisition, became effective upon the closing of the transaction.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including third party debt incurred in connection with the Separation, as well as any debt that we may incur in the future, will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash from operations, financings or asset sales and the tax consequences of our repatriation of overseas cash. Due to the global nature of our operations, a significant portion of our cash is held outside the Unites States. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $63.3 million and $55.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, cash held by our non-U.S. operations totaled $59.7 million and $53.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe hold the vast majority of our cash and operating cash flows outside the United States, since this cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our capital expenditures and growth plans, as our manufacturing locations are primarily based outside of the United States. We have not provided for U.S. income taxes on $1.8 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, because we intend to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the United States.\nWe generate cash flow in the United States primarily through ongoing product sales, management fees and royalty income and we utilize cash in the United States primarily for expenses relating to operations and corporate functions, including management, administration and research and development. We have generated approximately $15.4 million, $36.4 million and $43.7 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the United States, as defined below, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which has been sufficient to meet our domestic cash needs in each such year, as most of our capital expenditures and expenses occurred outside of the United States during those years. Adjusted operating cash flow in the United States is not presented in accordance with GAAP and is defined as operating cash flow generated within the United States, net of corporate expense allocations, but excluding net U.S. interest expense related to intercompany notes payable to our Former Parent of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The adjusted operating cash flow in the United States amounts exclude U.S. interest expense related to intercompany net notes payable to our Former Parent, as these notes were settled prior to the Separation and these amounts are not necessarily representative of interest payments related to our future debt. We project that our cash generation within the United States for the foreseeable future will be self-sustaining to meet all estimated U.S. expenditures and, as such, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy our domestic cash needs, including the service of any third party debt incurred in the United States.\nOur management will continue to reassess our need to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nCash Flow Summary\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized in the following table:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased $37.1 million compared to 2014, primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower revenues. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly accrued other expenses and deferred taxes, decreased operating cash flows. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $18.7 million.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $58.8 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower revenues and increased restructuring and production transfer related expenses. This was partially offset by a lower investment in adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as receivables, net of allowances, plus net inventories, less accounts payable) of $32.2 million. In addition, other changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly deferred taxes and accrued other expenses, increased operating cash flows.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities results primarily from cash outflows for capital expenditures, the capitalization of patent defense costs and investment activity.\nCapital spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $63.1 million, $83.9 million and $105.2 million, or 5.8%, 7.4% and 8.7% as a percentage of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The large drivers of the capital expenditures have been related to investment in new product launches, the ongoing investment in MEMS manufacturing capacity expansion to support growth in the handset market as well as manufacturing footprint optimization projects. Construction and customization of a new manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines started in 2012 and continued throughout 2013. Fully operational in 2014, this 215,000 square foot facility supports several growth and productivity initiatives for us.\nCapitalization of patent defense costs. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically seven to ten years. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid $1.0 million, $16.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in gross legal costs related to the defense of our patents. Capitalized patent defense costs decreased in 2015 due primarily to lower legal expenses incurred in 2014 associated with intellectual property litigation which has been settled.\nAcquisitions and sales of investments. We paid $35.1 million, net of cash acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 to acquire Audience. We received proceeds of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 from the sale of investments, which were part of the acquisition of Audience. We paid $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to acquire a non-controlling interest in a MEMS timing device company and subsequently received proceeds of $14.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 from the sale of our non-controlling interest in the same MEMS timing device company.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $45.0 million in additional net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the $15.0 million in scheduled principal payments on our term loan, whereas cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to cash payments to our Former Parent of $468.2 million as a result of the Separation, partially offset by $400.0 million in proceeds from debt. For additional information on our debt, see Note 11. Borrowings and Lines of Credit of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our management believes these measures are useful in measuring our cash generated from operations and cash generated from operations as a percentage of revenue that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase Knowles' common stock. Free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue are not presented in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry. As such, free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nOur businesses tend to have stronger revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles due to the highly technical nature of the industries they serve, which can result in new OEM product launches that can impact quarterly revenues, earnings and cash flow.\nThe following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:\n\nIn 2015, we generated free cash flow of $15.3 million, representing 1.4% of revenue, compared to free cash flow in 2014 of $31.6 million, representing 2.8% of revenue and free cash flow in 2013 of $69.1 million, or 5.7% of revenue. The decrease in free cash flow in 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to a reduction in earnings. The lower free cash flow in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a reduction in earnings.\nIn 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 5.0% to 6.0% of revenue.\nContingent Obligations\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nA summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows:\n\n (1) Primarily relates to the maturity of indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan due in January 2019. Does not give effect to any early repayment of or future amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. (2) Represents off-balance sheet commitments related to operating leases. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. (3) Represents off-balance sheet commitments for purchase obligations related to open purchase orders with our vendors. (4) Represents obligations related to capital leases. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. (5) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our subsidiary's unfunded non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In addition, defined benefit plan contributions of $1.7 million were included for 2016 only as they cannot be determined beyond 2016. See Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. (6) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. See Note 12. Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information. \nBorrowings and Lines of Credit\nOn January 27, 2014, we entered into a $200.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility, as well as a $300.0 million five-year senior secured term loan facility pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement, which are referred to collectively as the Credit Facilities.\u201d In connection with the Separation, we incurred $100.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $300.0 million of borrowings under the term loan facility, in each case to finance a cash payment to Dover immediately prior to the Separation.\nOn December 31, 2014, we amended our Credit Facilities to (i) increase the amount of the revolving credit facility in the Original Credit Agreement to $350.0 million from $200.0 million, (ii) increase the amount of the letter of credit subfacility in the Original Credit Agreement to $50.0 million from $25.0 million, (iii) eliminated the swing line subfacility in the amount of up to $35.0 million in the Original Credit Agreement and (iv) reduced to $100.0 million from $250.0 million the amount of additional incremental revolving or term loans in the Original Credit Agreement. All other terms and conditions of the Credit Facilities remained essentially the same.\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to facilitate its ability to consummate the acquisition of Audience, which became effective upon the closing of the transaction. The amendment, among other things (i) amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the credit agreement to allow the Company to make certain adjustments attributable to cash items in excess of the 15% cap set forth therein for any fiscal quarter occurring in the fiscal year 2014 (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities), (ii) provided that pro forma calculations with respect to the acquisition (except with regard to calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the interest rate under the facilities) shall disregard the consolidated EBITDA attributable to Audience for all periods prior to the first day of the first fiscal quarter following the acquisition and (iii) provided that all calculations as to whether the acquisition is a Permitted Acquisition\u201d under the credit agreement will be made as of the date of the agreement, but after giving effect to the amendment.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to its Credit Agreement in which it amended the definition of change in control\u201d to allow the incumbent board to approve a slate of directors.\nOn February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to its Credit Agreement in connection with the Company's decision to sell the speakers and receivers product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment. The third amendment, among other things, amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the Credit Agreement to allow adjustments for (i) the amount by which consolidated net income has been reduced by net losses attributable to the \"Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations\" (defined as the operations (including assets held for sale) comprising the speaker and receiver product line of the Company's Mobile Consumer Electronics segment that have been disposed of, abandoned or discontinued or which are being held for sale) for any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2016 and (ii) cash costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations on or prior to March 31, 2017, with an aggregate cap on adjustments attributable to such cash costs and expenses of $45.0 million; provided that, in each case, such adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA attributable to the Speakers and Receivers Discontinued Operations shall be disregarded in calculating the leverage ratio for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The third amendment also includes permanent reduction by the Company of the aggregate revolving commitment under the Credit Agreement from $350.0 million to $300.0 million.\nUp to $100.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for borrowings in euros, British pounds sterling and other currencies requested by us and agreed to by the lenders.\nLoans outstanding under the term facility will mature on January 27, 2019 and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in annual amounts (expressed as percentages of the loans made under the term facility on the initial funding date of the term facility, which was February 28, 2014) as set forth below, with the remaining balance due on the final maturity date of the term facility.\n\nWe have the right to prepay borrowings under the facilities and to reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in each case, at any time without premium or penalty (except for Eurodollar breakage fees, if any). We are required to prepay borrowings under the term facility with 100% of the net cash proceeds of sales or dispositions of assets or other property (including, among others, the proceeds of issuances of equity interests by subsidiaries), subject to certain reinvestment rights and other exceptions. The interest rates under the facilities are variable based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate at the time of the borrowing and our leverage as measured by a consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio and initially are set at LIBOR plus 1.50%. A commitment fee will accrue on the average daily unused portion of the revolving facility at the rate of 0.2% to 0.4%, initially set at 0.25%. As we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates based on the structure of our Credit Facilities, we entered into an interest rate swap on November 12, 2014 to convert variable interest rate payments into a fixed rate on a notional amount of $100.0 million of debt for monthly interest payments starting in January 2016 and ending in July 2018.\nThe facilities contain customary covenants, which include, among others, limitations or restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens and entry into sales and leaseback transactions, mergers, transfers of all or substantially all assets, transactions with affiliates and certain transactions limiting the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The facilities also include a requirement, to be tested quarterly, that we maintain both (i) a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.25 to 1.0 and (ii) a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of 3.25 to 1.0. For these ratios, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated interest expense are calculated in a manner defined in the debt agreement. The facilities include customary events of defaults. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.\nRisk Management\nWe are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our ongoing business operations, including changes in currency exchange rates, the dependence on key customers and price volatility for certain commodities. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Exposure\nWe conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, could result in increased foreign exchange exposures. A weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but would be beneficial to the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. A strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would positively affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales, but adversely would have a negative effect on the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily driven by changes in the Chinese renminbi (yuan), the euro, the Malaysian ringgit and the Philippine peso. Based on our current sales and manufacturing activity, a sustained 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar for a period of one year would reduce our operating results by approximately $44.1 million pre-tax.\nDependence on Key Customers; Concentration of Credit\nThe loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Apple, Inc. accounted for approximately 25% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 20% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 25% and 15% of our total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during these periods. If a key customer fails to meet payment obligations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCommodity Pricing\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components, which are generally available from a number of sources. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing for various precious metals, such as palladium and gold, and rare earth\u201d materials (dysprosium and neodymium), fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities.\nInterest Rates\nA hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting our external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2015 would be $3.3 million on a pre-tax basis. In 2014, we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on $100.0 million of our outstanding debt. The swap is effective in January 2016 and matures in July 2018, and the interest rate expense on the $100.0 million will be approximately $1.8 million on a pre-tax basis for the year ending December 31, 2016. Changes to variable interest rates during January 2016 through July 2018 will not impact interest expenses on the notional amount of the swap.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of GAAP. GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis.\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss. We do not have significant service revenue, licensing income, or multiple deliverable arrangements. We recognize third-party licensing or royalty income as revenue over the related contract term. Revenue is recognized net of customer discounts, rebates and returns. Rebates are recognized over the contract period based on expected revenue levels. Sales discounts and rebates totaled $9.9 million, $14.3 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Returns and allowances totaled $7.2 million, $10.3 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The value of inventory may decline as a result of surplus inventory, price reductions, or technological obsolescence. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of inventory when items have no future demand (obsolete inventory) and additionally, where inventory items on hand have demand, yet have insufficient forecasted activity to consume the entire stock within a reasonable period. It is our policy to carry reserves against the carrying value of such at-risk inventory items after considering the nature of the risk and any mitigating factors.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives (primarily trademarks) are not amortized. Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We conduct our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year with an evaluation date of October 1. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two-step process. We identified four reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment test. Step one of the test compares the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method to its book value. This method uses our market assumptions including projections of future cash flows, determinations of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions which are considered reasonable and inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis. The projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The fair value of all of our reporting units determined in step one exceeded the carrying values by at least 20%. A reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units could trigger an impairment in the future. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Step two, which compares the book value of the goodwill to its implied fair value, was not necessary since there were no indicators of potential impairment from step one during any of the periods presented. Should our market capitalization fall below the book value of our total stockholders' equity and remain at that level for a sustained period, we could conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets are materially impaired, in which case, we would be required under GAAP to record a non-cash charge to our earnings, which could be a significant amount and adversely impact our financial results.\nSimilar to goodwill, in testing its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we use a relief from royalty method to calculate and compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its book value. This method estimates the fair value of trade names by calculating the present value of royalty income that could hypothetically be earned by licensing the trade name to a third party over the remaining useful life. Any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles was indicated for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nSee Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information on goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.\nOther Intangible and Long-Lived Assets: Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of unpatented technology, patents, trademarks customer relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 15 years. We rely on patents and proprietary technology and seek patent protection for products and methods. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. These costs are amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is typically 7 to 10 years. We assess the future economic benefit and/or the successful outcome of legal action related to patent defense involves considerable management judgment and a different outcome could result in material write-offs of the carrying value of these assets. Other intangible assets with determinable lives at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $65.0 million, $238.3 million and $286.3 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $0.5 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in legal costs related to the defense of our patents.\nLong-lived assets (including intangible assets with determinable lives) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is produced and compared to its carrying value. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We recorded Impairments of fixed and other assets of $53.4 million, $1.4 million and $3.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, we recorded Impairment of intangible assets of $144.7 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Balances: For purposes of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been estimated as if we filed income tax returns on a stand-alone basis separate from our Former Parent. As a stand-alone entity, our deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differ from those of our Former Parent in the historical periods.\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such assessments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires considerable judgment on the part of management with respect to the benefits that could be realized from future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors.\nWe have evaluated our deferred tax assets for each of the reporting periods, including an assessment of cumulative income over the prior three-year period. Since we are in a cumulative loss position in the United States, there is significant negative evidence that impairs the ability to rely on projections of future income. Due to a lack of significant positive evidence and cumulative losses in the respective prior three-year periods, a valuation allowance was required for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 periods.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Adjustments are made to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are believed to be appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were (6.1)%, 57.9% and (4.2)%, respectively.\nWe have not provided for any residual U.S. income taxes on the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are currently intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, or the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.\nAccruals and Reserves: We have accruals and reserves that require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using certain factors, which include but are not limited to, actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. Most recently, we have established liabilities for restructuring activities, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts.\nStock-Based Compensation: The principal awards issued under the stock-based compensation plans include stock options, restricted stock units and stock-settled stock appreciation rights (\"SSARs\"). The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period and is included in Cost of goods sold, Research and development expenses and Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, depending on the functional area of the underlying employees.\nWe use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SSARs and stock options granted to employees. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is equal to the share price at the date of the grant. At the time of grant, we estimate forfeitures, based on historical experience, in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. See Note 13. Equity Incentive Program of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to our stock-based compensation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 32: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices and decreased demand from certain customers.\n\n- Net loss was $233.8 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $87 million in 2014. The larger net loss was mainly driven by impairment charges related to the speaker and receiver product line. \n\n- The company completed the acquisition of Audience Inc. in July 2015 for $61.6 million in cash and 3.2 million shares. This expanded Knowles' capabilities in voice and audio solutions.\n\n- Knowles operates in two segments: Mobile Consumer Electronics (MCE) and Specialty Components (SC). MCE revenue decreased in 2015 due to lower average selling prices while SC revenue declined due to lower pricing and reduced demand.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $78.4 million in 2015, down from $115.5 million in 2014, primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower revenues.\n\n- Knowles has debt of $430 million as of Dec 31, 2015 relating to credit facilities entered into in 2014. Cash and equivalents were $63.3 million.\n\n- The company plans to sell its speaker and receiver product line in 2016 as it lacks a path to profitability. An impairment charge of $191.5 million was recorded in 2015 for this product line.\n\nIn summary, Knowles faced challenging market conditions in 2015 that led to lower revenues and profits. The company is taking steps such as the Audience acquisition and planned divestiture to reposition itself for improved performance."}
