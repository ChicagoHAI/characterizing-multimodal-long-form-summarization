MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions)\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and which involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nMPM Holdings Inc. ( Momentive\u201d) and Momentive Performance Materials Inc. ( MPM\u201d), both Delaware corporations, together with their subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company\u201d), are one of the world's largest producers of silicones and silicone derivatives and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Silicones are a multi-functional family of materials used in a wide variety of products and serve as a critical ingredient in many construction, automotive, industrial, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural uses. Silicones are generally used as an additive to or formulated product in a wide variety of, end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (temperature, ultraviolet light, and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Some of the most well-known end-use product applications include bath and shower caulk, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, foam products, cosmetics, and tires. Due to their versatility and high-performance characteristics, silicones are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. Our Quartz Technologies segment manufactures quartz and specialty ceramics for use in a number of high-technology industries, which typically require products made to precise specifications. The cost of our products typically represents a small percentage of the overall cost of our customers' products.\nWe serve more than 4,000 customers between our Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies businesses in over 100 countries. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.\nReportable Segments\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we reorganized our segment structure and bifurcated our Silicones segment into Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones to better reflect our specialty chemical portfolio and related performance. This reorganization included a change in our reportable segments from two to four segments. Our operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz. Our reorganized segments are based on the products that we offer and the markets that we serve. At December 31, 2018, we had four reportable segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, Quartz Technologies, and Corporate.\nOur Performance Additives segment is one of the leading manufacturers of specialty silanes, silicone fluids, and urethane additives. Our liquid additives are key ingredients in our customers' products and are used to improve or enable the performance characteristics and processability of a variety of products across different end-markets including automotive, personal care, agriculture, consumer and construction. Our silicone fluids, silanes, and urethane additives Performance Additives product lines are developed using a range of raw material inputs and generally use more limited siloxane than Formulated and Basic Silicone products.\nOur Formulated and Basic Silicones segment produces electronic materials, coatings, elastomers, sealants, and basic silicone fluids focused on automotive, consumer goods, construction, electronics and healthcare end-markets. Our products enable key design features, such as extended product life, wear resistance, biocompatibility and weight reduction. Our electronic materials, coatings and sealants product lines are generally applied to our customers' products, in the form of a high-tech coating or adhesive, while our elastomers product lines are fashioned into parts by extruding or molding them in items such as gaskets or tubing. Formulated silicones product offerings are typically used to seal, protect or adhere, and often perform multiple functions at once.\nOur Quartz Technologies segment is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and non-oxide based ceramic powders and shapes. Fused quartz products are manufactured from quartz sand and are used in processes requiring extreme temperature and high purity. Momentive's high-purity fused quartz materials are used for a diverse range of applications in which optical clarity, design flexibility and durability in extreme environments are critical, such as semiconductor, lighting, healthcare and aerospace. Our product line includes tubing, rods and other solid shapes, as well as fused quartz crucibles for growing single crystal silicon. Our Quartz Technologies segment's products are the material solution for silicon chip semiconductor manufacturing.\nOur organizational structure continues to evolve. We are also continuing to refine our business and operating structure to better align our services to our customers and improve our cost position, while continuing to invest in global growth opportunities.\n2018 Overview\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Sales-Net sales in 2018 were $2,705, an increase of 16% compared with $2,331 in 2017.

The increase in Segment EBITDA was driven by improved market dynamics in our basics end markets, continued growth in our specialty businesses, and the benefits of prior strategic investments in our specialty capabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 Outlook\nOn September 13, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with MOM Holding Company, a Delaware corporation ( Parent\u201d), and MOM Special Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d). Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of SJL Partners, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of South Korea ( SJL\u201d), KCC Corporation, a South Korean corporation ( KCC\u201d), and Wonik Holdings Co., Ltd., a South Korean limited company ( Wonik\u201d and, together with SJL and KCC, the Investors\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Momentive (the Merger\u201d), with Momentive surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The transaction is valued at approximately $3,100, which includes the assumption of net debt, pension and certain other postretirement liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Momentive, KCC, Wonik, and the investment committee of SJL and by Momentive's stockholders holding a majority of Momentive's common stock, Parent will assume Momentive's net debt obligations. Momentive stockholders will receive as merger consideration $32.50 for each share of common stock they own subject to a downward adjustment in the event that the aggregate cash held by the Company at the end of the last calendar quarter prior to completion of the Merger is less than $250. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt that will be put in place at closing. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency and is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to requisite regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nAs we look into 2019, we expect industry fundamentals to improve, and growth as a result of the capital investments we have made in our specialty product portfolio over the last several years. Despite the slowdown in China, increased macroeconomic volatility, and duty and related impacts of the US and China trade war we believe we are well positioned for continued earnings growth and margin improvement. Specifically, our NXT expansion has been completed and is expected to double our capacity in our fastest growing product line enabling state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities on two continents. We expect that this will drive growth moving forward, allowing us to strengthen our leadership position in automotive tire applications and enable additional new product offerings. In 2018, we implemented price increases across our entire silicones product portfolio which are expected to benefit us and offset inflation we are experiencing for certain raw materials. We are also well positioned to leverage our leadership positions, optimize our portfolio, and invest in and drive new growth programs. Additionally, we expect 2019 sales to continue to reflect a mix improvement as we reduce exposure to under-performing siloxane derivative products and grow our higher margin specialty products.\nWe are continuing to leverage our research and development capabilities and invest in high-growth product lines and geographical regions, positioning the Company for long-term success. We are also focused on gaining productivity efficiencies and improving margins through investments in improved operational reliability. We continue to evaluate additional actions, as well as productivity measures, that could support further cost savings. Such actions could include additional restructuring and incremental exit and disposal costs.\nIn March 2018, we announced a restructuring program totaling $15 in estimated annual run rate cost reductions with approximately $8 realized in 2018. The most recent program primarily targets selling, general, and administrative cost reductions.\nIn October 2018, we exercised a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest for approximately $30 in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd, a joint venture in China which manufactures siloxane, one of our key intermediate materials. As a result, our ownership interest in this joint venture was increased to 49% from 25%.\nWe remain focused on driving free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and optimizing net working capital, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, in fiscal year 2019.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ( E.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d The U.K Prime Minister triggered this process on March 29, 2017, meaning the U.K, was scheduled to leave originally on March 29, 2019. As a result of the referendum, it was expected that the British government will be negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. It is unknown what those terms will be as two earlier motions to establish these terms were not successful in the U.K. House of Parliament, causing U.K to seek an extension to exit from the E.U. which was granted by the E.U. on March 21, 2019 to happen on May 22, 2019, provided the third motion to establish the terms of exit from the E.U, is successful, otherwise the exit to occur on April 12, 2019. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. Currently, the Company does not expect that Brexit will have a material impact on its business.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nMatters Impacting Comparability of Results\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOur other comprehensive income is significantly impacted by foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is driven by the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary assets and liabilities driving the adjustments are cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; accounts payable and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The primary currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated are the euro and Japanese yen.\nRaw Materials\nIn 2018, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion of raw materials. The largest raw material used in our business is silicon metal. The cost of silicon metal comprised approximately 12% of our total raw material costs in 2018. In 2018, inflation was felt across the entire chemical industry in raw materials, logistics and finished goods. However, to limit and minimize exposure to inflation, we contracted directly or indirectly for much of our key raw material purchases.\nNaturally occurring quartz sand is the key raw material for many of the products manufactured by our Quartz Technologies business, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. While we also use quartz sand from several global sand suppliers, one of our suppliers, a major producer of natural quartz sand, controls a significant portion of the market for this sand. In December 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with this supplier, which expires on December 31, 2021.\nWe expect long-term raw material cost fluctuations to continue because of price movements of key feedstocks. To help mitigate the fluctuations in raw material pricing, we have purchase and sale contracts and commercial arrangements with many of our vendors and customers that contain periodic price adjustment mechanisms. Due to differences in the timing of pricing mechanism trigger points between our sales and purchase contracts, there is often a lead-lag\u201d impact. In many cases this lead-lag\u201d impact can negatively impact our margins in the short term in periods of rising raw material prices and positively impact them in the short term in periods of falling raw material prices.\nITEM 7.

This increase was primarily due to a volume increase of approximately $156 due to improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets and increased demand in almost all our end markets namely automotive, agriculture, construction, consumer, personal care, electronics, energy, health and personal care, and industrial end markets, and a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $183, driven by our continuous intentional shift towards higher-margin products as well as pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. Favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $35 also contributed to the increase in net sales.\nIn 2017, net sales increased by $98, or 4%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by our intentional shift toward higher-margin products due to increased demand in automotive, electronics, and consumer end markets versus less profitable commodity products, resulting in a volume increase of approximately $46, favorable price/mix shift of $46, and exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $6.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOperating Income (Loss)\n2018 vs 2017 Operating Results\nIn 2018, operating income increased by $126 and $127 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from operating income of $80 and $81, respectively, to an operating income of $206 and $208, respectively. Cost of sales increased by $247 compared to 2017, primarily due to our sales increase and its related impacts, along with $110 due to the impact of raw material inflation and $16 related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were offset by a decrease of $14 in net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7 and $8 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2017, primarily due to our announced global restructuring program, timing of services and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $2. Research and development expense increased by $5 for both Momentive and MPM compared to 2017 primarily related to the timing of new projects.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2018 increased by $8 compared to 2017, mainly due to the severance-related costs pursuant to our global restructuring program announced in March 2018 and lower gains relating to insurance reimbursements.\nOther operating loss decreased by $5, mainly due to business-related subsidies, lower scrapping of long-lived assets, and foreign currency translation gains.\n2017 vs 2016 Operating Results\nIn 2017, operating income increased by $127 and $126 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from an operating loss of $47 and $45 respectively, to an operating income of $80 and $81, respectively. Cost of sales decreased by $14 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation of $29, favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $17 and raw material deflation of $5, partially offset by the related impacts of increased sales and higher net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $27 and $28 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2016 primarily due to increase in the number of employees to sustain growth, impact of a merit increase implemented in 2016 and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $5. Research and development expense for 2017 was flat compared to 2016.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2017 decreased by $36 compared to 2016 mainly due to the gain related to an insurance reimbursement of $24 related to fire damage at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and $13 for one-time costs in 2016 triggered by the siloxane capacity transformation programs not recurring in 2017.\nOther operating loss decreased by $6, primarily due to a decrease of $8 in impairments and disposals of certain assets and equipment and a settlement gain of $2 related to the resolution of a take or pay arrangement and certain sales and use tax refunds offset by $4 due to the impacts of foreign currency translation losses.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nTotal Non-Operating Expense (Gain)\nIn 2018, total non-operating expense increased by $30, from an expense of $65 to an expense of $95, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to $11 in unfavorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities and $10 due to the incremental costs pertaining to professional fees and higher bankruptcy court fees incurred directly as a result of our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of 2014 from which we emerged in 2014.\nIn 2017, total non-operating expense decreased by $34, from an expense of $99 to an expense of $65, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $38 in favorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities offset by the gain on extinguishment of Second Lien Notes not recurring in 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, income tax expense increased by $29 compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate was 40% and 39% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2018 compared to 100% and 94% for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized. Due to fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss between jurisdictions with and without a valuation allowance established, our historical effective tax rates are likely not indicative of our future effective tax rates.\nIn 2017, income tax expense decreased by $3 compared to 2016. The effective income tax rate was 100% and 94% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2017 compared to (13%) for 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized.\nFor 2018, profits incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates greater than 21% (primarily Japan, Brazil, and China) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2017, profits and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates less than 35% (primarily China, Thailand and Japan) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2016, China, Germany, and Thailand comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, we are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive income by $23 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign currency translation positively impacted other comprehensive income by $45 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2017, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $13, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service benefit related to the effect of certain plan provision changes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $17, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service credit related to the effect of plan redesign triggered by certain changes to company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFollowing are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment. Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain other income and expenses. Segment EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA is also a principle profitability measure used to set management and executive incentive compensation goals. EBITDA and Segment EBITDA should not be considered substitutes for net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MPM HOLDINGS INC.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Additives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Formulated and Basic Silicones\n</td> <td>1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quartz Technologies\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Additives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Formulated and Basic Silicones\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quartz Technologies\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Additives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>849\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Formulated and Basic Silicones\n</td> <td>1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quartz Technologies\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance Additives\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Formulated and Basic Silicones\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quartz Technologies\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Inter-segment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.\nITEM 7.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of $35 related to our automotive, agriculture, and personal care end markets, reflecting our growth initiatives across our entire portfolio, $24 of favorable price/mix shift, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $14 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies,\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $193 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to volume growth, favorable price/mix shift and contributions from past strategic capital investments, offset by start up cost related to our NXT expansion in Germany during 2018.\nFormulated and Basic Silicones\nNet sales in 2018 increased $293 or 24%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $155 driven by intentional shift towards higher-margin products and pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017, a favorable increase in sales volume of $118 reflecting improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets, as well as strong growth within our specialty portfolio driven by increased demand in electronics, construction, consumer, energy, health care and industrial end markets, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $20 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $95 to $200 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the same factors impacting net sales as well as strategic capital investments.\nQuartz Technologies\nNet sales in 2018 increased $8, or 4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to volume increase of $4 mainly due to improved market conditions in the electronics market and approximately $4 related to a favorable price/mix shift.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $45 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and volume leverage from increased sales.\nCorporate\nCorporate charges are primarily general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as shared service and administrative functions.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, reorganization items, net represented professional fees and bankruptcy court fees.\nSegment Realignment\nThe Financial Standards Accounting Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, defines operating segments as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we reorganized our segment structure and bifurcated our Silicones segment into Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones to better reflect our specialty chemical portfolio and related performance. This reorganization included a change in our operating segments from two to four segments. We reorganized to the new four segments model, by implementing the following:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>financial information is prepared separately and regularly for each of the four segments; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the CEO would regularly review the results of operations and assesses the performance of each of these segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOur operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and funds available under the ABL Facility. Our primary continuing liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, debt service and capital expenditures.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $1,253 of indebtedness. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had $507 in liquidity consisting of the following:\n\u2022$259 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (of which $214 is maintained in foreign jurisdictions); and\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$248 of availability under the ABL Facility ($300 borrowing base, less $52 of outstanding letters of credit and subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that will only apply if our availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $498 and $482, respectively. A summary of the components of our net working capital as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of LTM Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of LTM Net Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net working capital of $16 from December 31, 2017 was partially due to an increase in accounts receivable because of increased sales in the period offset by our strategic initiatives to expedite the collection process. In addition, inventory was impacted by the slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter. These increases were offset by an increase in accounts payable due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation as well as exchange rate fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen.\nWe remain focused on driving positive free cash flow in 2019 through our global cost control initiatives and aggressively managing net working capital. To minimize the impact of net working capital on cash flows, we continue to review inventory safety stock levels where possible. We also continue to focus on receivable collections by accelerating receipts through the sale of receivables at a discount.\nWe have the ability to borrow from the ABL Facility to support our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nOn March 2, 2018, we entered into an amendment to our ABL Facility to extend the maturity of the ABL Facility from October 2019 to March 2, 2023, subject to a springing maturity 91 days prior to the calculated maturity date for each of the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes if the principal amount outstanding for such series of notes exceeds $50 million, and increase the commitments under the ABL Facility by $30 for a total of $300, incurring $4 of fees for this amendment, which is being amortized through March 2, 2023 on a straight line basis.\n2019 Outlook\nWe believe we are favorably positioned to fund our ongoing liquidity requirements. We believe that due to our businesses operating cash flows as well as our $507 of liquidity in the form of cash and our ABL facility, our long-term debt maturities in 2021 and 2022, and our annual debt service costs of approximately $55, our business has adequate capital resources to meet material commitments coming due during the next 12-month period. We are well positioned to make strategic capital investments, leverage our leadership positions with both our customers and suppliers, optimize our portfolio and drive new growth programs. Our business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment, and these factors could have negative effects to our liquidity. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity, which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance.\nCapital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately $119, approximately $19 of which relates to certain growth and productivity projects. We remain focused on continuing to balance opportunistic and accretive growth investments with our commitment to continued de-leveraging and maintaining significant financial flexibility.\nWe expect to have adequate liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on our balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nDebt Repurchases and Other Transactions\nFrom time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as on our cash balances and liquidity, we or our affiliates may seek to acquire (and have acquired) our outstanding equity and/or debt securities or other indebtedness of the Company through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing our notes if applicable), for cash or other consideration. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $48 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for approximately $26, resulting in a net gain of $16. All repurchased notes were canceled at the time of repurchase, reducing the aggregate principal amount of these notes outstanding from $250 at the end of third quarter of 2015 to $202 as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have considered and will continue to evaluate potential transactions to reduce net debt, such as debt for debt exchanges and other transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives or combinations thereof we or our affiliates may choose to pursue in the future as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing documents.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nFollowing are highlights from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPM HOLDINGS INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources (uses) of cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash flow\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources (uses) of cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash flow\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nIn 2018, operations generated $235 and $239 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $69 and $71 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $193 and $192 in net non-cash items, respectively, for Momentive and MPM, of which $159 was for depreciation and amortization, $26 for amortization of debt discount costs, $5 and $4 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $6 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, offset by $3 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds. Net working capital used $33 of cash primarily, due to an increase of $35 in accounts receivable because of timing of sales in the period and selling price increase and an an increase of $36 in inventories due to slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter, offset by an increase of $38 in accounts payable primarily due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2017, operations generated $113 and $115 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $0 and $1 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $168 net non-cash items, of which $154 was for depreciation and amortization, $25 for amortization of debt discount costs, $4 and $3 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $14 due to loss on impaired and scrapped assets offset by: $5 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, $6 of unrealized foreign\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ncurrency gains, $9 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to deferred income tax benefit. Net working capital used $25 of cash primarily, due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $30 and $36, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $41, primarily due to reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2016, operations generated $142 and $144 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $163 and $161 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $234 of net non-cash items, of which $185 was for depreciation and amortization, $33 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our pension benefit liabilities, $23 for amortization of debt discount costs, offset by: $12 due to loss on impaired assets, $3 of unrealized foreign currency gains, and $9 related to gain on the extinguishment of debt. Net working capital generated $7 of cash primarily driven by customer mix and timing of collections and strategic investment in profitable products, safety stock increase to support our Leverkusen, Germany site transformation and due to the strike at our Waterford, NY site. Changes in other assets and liabilities, due to/from affiliates and income taxes payable are driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, which primarily included incentive compensation, certain liabilities related to siloxane capacity transformation programs, interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2018, investing activities used $141 and $143 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $112 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $3 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $30 as cost of exercising a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd. Capital expenditures used $42 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $70 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2017, investing activities used $171 and $172 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $161 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $9 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to our acquisition of a business. Capital expenditures used $73 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $88 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2016, investing activities used $117 and $118 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. We spent $117 for ongoing capital expenditures, out of which $46 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $71 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2018, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $4 related to ABL financing fees and $47 related to repayments of short-term debt. Financing activities also provided $47 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2017, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $51 related to repayments of short-term debt and provided $50 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2016, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $16 and $17 of cash, respectively, mainly due to $48 related to repayments of short-term debt offset by $48 related to borrowings of short-term debt and the buyback of $29 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for $16. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were $52 in outstanding letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under our $300 ABL Facility, leaving unused borrowing capacity of $248.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility contains various restrictive covenants that prohibit us and/or restrict our ability to prepay indebtedness, including our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (collectively, the notes\u201d). In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing our notes, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, make investments or declare or pay any dividends. However, all of these restrictions are subject to exceptions.\nThere are certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent of such subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends, loans or otherwise, which primarily arise as a result of certain foreign government regulations or as a result of restrictions within certain subsidiaries' financing agreements that limit such transfers to the amounts of available earnings and profits or otherwise limit the amount of dividends that can be distributed. In either case, we have alternative methods to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the form of intercompany loans and/or returns of capital in such instances where payment of dividends is limited to the extent of earnings and profits.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nis considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nCovenants Under the ABL Facility and the Notes\nThe instruments that govern our indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants (and incurrence tests in certain cases) regarding indebtedness, dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions, capital expenditures and, under certain circumstances, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, as further described below. Payment of borrowings under the ABL Facility and our notes may be accelerated if there is an event of default as determined under the governing debt instrument. Events of default under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility include the failure to pay principal and interest when due, a material breach of a representation or warranty, events of bankruptcy, a change of control and most covenant defaults. Events of default under the indentures governing our notes include the failure to pay principal and interest, a failure to comply with covenants, subject to a 30-day grace period in certain instances, and certain events of bankruptcy.\nThe ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if our availability under the ABL Facility at any time was less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27. The fixed charge coverage ratio (the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\u201d) is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis and calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nIn addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, we are also subject to certain incurrence tests under the indentures governing our notes that restrict our ability to take certain actions if we are unable to meet specified ratios. For instance, the indentures governing our notes contain an incurrence test that restricts our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments, among other actions, if we do not maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio (measured on a LTM basis) of at least 2.0 to 1.0. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. The restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments under the indentures that apply as a result, however, are subject to exceptions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under the ABL Facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the notes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. We believe that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to comply with our financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, like EBITDA and Segment EBITDA, is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense.\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we have to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management to select the appropriate assumptions to determine these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty; therefore, actual results may differ significantly from estimated results. We base these judgments on our historical experience, advice from experienced consultants, forecasts and other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates. Deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowances based upon management's estimates of realizability.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had valuation allowances of $328 and $371, respectively, against our deferred income tax assets. At December 31, 2018, we had a $173 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $155 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany. At December 31, 2017, we had a $181 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $190 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany and Japan. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both negative and positive evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three-year period. This evidence is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain.\nWe considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Taxable income in prior carryback years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tax planning strategies; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax return. We also apply the guidance relating to de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations. Unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Tax benefits are measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially impacted. An unfavorable income tax settlement would require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $41 and $39, respectively.\nPensions\nThe amounts that we recognize in our financial statements for pension benefit obligations are determined by actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are certain assumptions, the more significant of which are:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The weighted average rate used for discounting the liability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The method used to determine market-related value of pension plan assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The weighted average rate of future salary increases; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The anticipated mortality rate tables.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nThe discount rate reflects the rate at which pensions could be effectively settled. When selecting a discount rate, our actuaries provide us with a cash flow model that uses the yields of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities consistent with our anticipated cash flow projections.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the various plans' current and projected asset mix. To determine the expected overall long-term rate of return on assets, we take into account the rates on long-term debt investments that are held in the portfolio, as well as expected trends in the equity markets, for plans including equity securities.\nThe rate of increase in future compensation levels is determined based on salary and wage trends in the chemical and other similar industries, as well as our specific compensation targets.\nThe mortality tables that are used represent the best estimated mortality projections for each particular country and reflect projected mortality improvements.\nWe believe the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and pension expense are appropriate in the current economic environment. However, as economic conditions change, we may change some of our assumptions, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table presents the sensitivity of our projected pension benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d), accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d), and 2019 pension expense to the following changes in key assumptions:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease) at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ABO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in discount rate of 0.5%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in discount rate of 0.5%\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the relative asset allocations of plan assets in each investment category see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs events warrant, we evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, by assessing whether the carrying value can be recovered over their remaining useful lives through the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the underlying asset groups. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result, future decisions to change our manufacturing process, exit certain businesses, reduce excess capacity, temporarily idle facilities and close facilities could result in material impairment charges. Long-lived assets are grouped together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of long-lived assets. Any impairment loss that may be required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value.\nWe perform an annual assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of any events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets. If, after assessing all events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, we use a probability weighted market and income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Our market approach is a comparable analysis technique commonly used in the investment banking and private equity industries based on the EBITDA multiple technique. Under this technique, estimated fair value is the result of a market based EBITDA multiple that is applied to an appropriate historical EBITDA amount, adjusted for the additional fair value that would be assigned by a market participant obtaining control over the reporting unit. Our income approach is a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Applying this discount rate to the multiyear projections provides an estimate of fair value for the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model does not include cash flows related to interest payments and debt service, as the related debt has not been pushed down to the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for the evaluation of our goodwill recoverability are our following operating segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies.\nAt October 1, 2018, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 10%. It is possible that the conclusions regarding the impairment or recoverability of goodwill at either reporting unit could change in future periods if, for example, the reporting unit\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ndoes not perform as projected, the results of strategic plans and certain cost saving initiatives are not fully achieved, or the overall economic or business conditions are worse than current assumptions (including inputs to the discount rate or market based EBITDA multiples). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events and circumstances change, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions)\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and which involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nMPM Holdings Inc. ( Momentive\u201d) and Momentive Performance Materials Inc. ( MPM\u201d), both Delaware corporations, together with their subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company\u201d), are one of the world's largest producers of silicones and silicone derivatives and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Silicones are a multi-functional family of materials used in a wide variety of products and serve as a critical ingredient in many construction, automotive, industrial, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural uses. Silicones are generally used as an additive to or formulated product in a wide variety of, end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (temperature, ultraviolet light, and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Some of the most well-known end-use product applications include bath and shower caulk, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, foam products, cosmetics, and tires. Due to their versatility and high-performance characteristics, silicones are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. Our Quartz Technologies segment manufactures quartz and specialty ceramics for use in a number of high-technology industries, which typically require products made to precise specifications. The cost of our products typically represents a small percentage of the overall cost of our customers' products.\nWe serve more than 4,000 customers between our Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies businesses in over 100 countries. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.\nReportable Segments\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we reorganized our segment structure and bifurcated our Silicones segment into Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones to better reflect our specialty chemical portfolio and related performance. This reorganization included a change in our reportable segments from two to four segments. Our operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz. Our reorganized segments are based on the products that we offer and the markets that we serve. At December 31, 2018, we had four reportable segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, Quartz Technologies, and Corporate.\nOur Performance Additives segment is one of the leading manufacturers of specialty silanes, silicone fluids, and urethane additives. Our liquid additives are key ingredients in our customers' products and are used to improve or enable the performance characteristics and processability of a variety of products across different end-markets including automotive, personal care, agriculture, consumer and construction. Our silicone fluids, silanes, and urethane additives Performance Additives product lines are developed using a range of raw material inputs and generally use more limited siloxane than Formulated and Basic Silicone products.\nOur Formulated and Basic Silicones segment produces electronic materials, coatings, elastomers, sealants, and basic silicone fluids focused on automotive, consumer goods, construction, electronics and healthcare end-markets. Our products enable key design features, such as extended product life, wear resistance, biocompatibility and weight reduction. Our electronic materials, coatings and sealants product lines are generally applied to our customers' products, in the form of a high-tech coating or adhesive, while our elastomers product lines are fashioned into parts by extruding or molding them in items such as gaskets or tubing. Formulated silicones product offerings are typically used to seal, protect or adhere, and often perform multiple functions at once.\nOur Quartz Technologies segment is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and non-oxide based ceramic powders and shapes. Fused quartz products are manufactured from quartz sand and are used in processes requiring extreme temperature and high purity. Momentive's high-purity fused quartz materials are used for a diverse range of applications in which optical clarity, design flexibility and durability in extreme environments are critical, such as semiconductor, lighting, healthcare and aerospace. Our product line includes tubing, rods and other solid shapes, as well as fused quartz crucibles for growing single crystal silicon. Our Quartz Technologies segment's products are the material solution for silicon chip semiconductor manufacturing.\nOur organizational structure continues to evolve. We are also continuing to refine our business and operating structure to better align our services to our customers and improve our cost position, while continuing to invest in global growth opportunities.\n2018 Overview\n \u2022 Net Sales-Net sales in 2018 were $2,705, an increase of 16% compared with $2,331 in 2017. The increase was driven by improved market dynamics in our basics end markets and volume gains across nearly all of Momentive's segments, which reflected the benefits of our strategic growth investments and increased demand in the agriculture, personal care, electronic, and industrial end markets. \n \u2022 Net Income (Loss)-Net income in 2018 was $69 and $71 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of $69 and $70, respectively, compared to net income of $0 and $1, respectively in 2017. This was primarily due to volume, mix and price increases across our product portfolio. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\n \u2022 Segment EBITDA-Segment EBITDA in 2018 was $400 and $401 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of $107 and $107, respectively, compared to $293 and $294, respectively in 2017. The increase in Segment EBITDA was driven by improved market dynamics in our basics end markets, continued growth in our specialty businesses, and the benefits of prior strategic investments in our specialty capabilities. \n2019 Outlook\nOn September 13, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with MOM Holding Company, a Delaware corporation ( Parent\u201d), and MOM Special Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d). Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of SJL Partners, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of South Korea ( SJL\u201d), KCC Corporation, a South Korean corporation ( KCC\u201d), and Wonik Holdings Co., Ltd., a South Korean limited company ( Wonik\u201d and, together with SJL and KCC, the Investors\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Momentive (the Merger\u201d), with Momentive surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The transaction is valued at approximately $3,100, which includes the assumption of net debt, pension and certain other postretirement liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Momentive, KCC, Wonik, and the investment committee of SJL and by Momentive's stockholders holding a majority of Momentive's common stock, Parent will assume Momentive's net debt obligations. Momentive stockholders will receive as merger consideration $32.50 for each share of common stock they own subject to a downward adjustment in the event that the aggregate cash held by the Company at the end of the last calendar quarter prior to completion of the Merger is less than $250. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt that will be put in place at closing. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency and is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to requisite regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nAs we look into 2019, we expect industry fundamentals to improve, and growth as a result of the capital investments we have made in our specialty product portfolio over the last several years. Despite the slowdown in China, increased macroeconomic volatility, and duty and related impacts of the US and China trade war we believe we are well positioned for continued earnings growth and margin improvement. Specifically, our NXT expansion has been completed and is expected to double our capacity in our fastest growing product line enabling state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities on two continents. We expect that this will drive growth moving forward, allowing us to strengthen our leadership position in automotive tire applications and enable additional new product offerings. In 2018, we implemented price increases across our entire silicones product portfolio which are expected to benefit us and offset inflation we are experiencing for certain raw materials. We are also well positioned to leverage our leadership positions, optimize our portfolio, and invest in and drive new growth programs. Additionally, we expect 2019 sales to continue to reflect a mix improvement as we reduce exposure to under-performing siloxane derivative products and grow our higher margin specialty products.\nWe are continuing to leverage our research and development capabilities and invest in high-growth product lines and geographical regions, positioning the Company for long-term success. We are also focused on gaining productivity efficiencies and improving margins through investments in improved operational reliability. We continue to evaluate additional actions, as well as productivity measures, that could support further cost savings. Such actions could include additional restructuring and incremental exit and disposal costs.\nIn March 2018, we announced a restructuring program totaling $15 in estimated annual run rate cost reductions with approximately $8 realized in 2018. The most recent program primarily targets selling, general, and administrative cost reductions.\nIn October 2018, we exercised a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest for approximately $30 in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd, a joint venture in China which manufactures siloxane, one of our key intermediate materials. As a result, our ownership interest in this joint venture was increased to 49% from 25%.\nWe remain focused on driving free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and optimizing net working capital, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, in fiscal year 2019.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ( E.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d The U.K Prime Minister triggered this process on March 29, 2017, meaning the U.K, was scheduled to leave originally on March 29, 2019. As a result of the referendum, it was expected that the British government will be negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. It is unknown what those terms will be as two earlier motions to establish these terms were not successful in the U.K. House of Parliament, causing U.K to seek an extension to exit from the E.U. which was granted by the E.U. on March 21, 2019 to happen on May 22, 2019, provided the third motion to establish the terms of exit from the E.U, is successful, otherwise the exit to occur on April 12, 2019. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. Currently, the Company does not expect that Brexit will have a material impact on its business.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nMatters Impacting Comparability of Results\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOur other comprehensive income is significantly impacted by foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is driven by the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary assets and liabilities driving the adjustments are cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; accounts payable and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The primary currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated are the euro and Japanese yen.\nRaw Materials\nIn 2018, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion of raw materials. The largest raw material used in our business is silicon metal. The cost of silicon metal comprised approximately 12% of our total raw material costs in 2018. In 2018, inflation was felt across the entire chemical industry in raw materials, logistics and finished goods. However, to limit and minimize exposure to inflation, we contracted directly or indirectly for much of our key raw material purchases.\nNaturally occurring quartz sand is the key raw material for many of the products manufactured by our Quartz Technologies business, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. While we also use quartz sand from several global sand suppliers, one of our suppliers, a major producer of natural quartz sand, controls a significant portion of the market for this sand. In December 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with this supplier, which expires on December 31, 2021.\nWe expect long-term raw material cost fluctuations to continue because of price movements of key feedstocks. To help mitigate the fluctuations in raw material pricing, we have purchase and sale contracts and commercial arrangements with many of our vendors and customers that contain periodic price adjustment mechanisms. Due to differences in the timing of pricing mechanism trigger points between our sales and purchase contracts, there is often a lead-lag\u201d impact. In many cases this lead-lag\u201d impact can negatively impact our margins in the short term in periods of rising raw material prices and positively impact them in the short term in periods of falling raw material prices.\nITEM 7.

This increase was primarily due to a volume increase of approximately $156 due to improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets and increased demand in almost all our end markets namely automotive, agriculture, construction, consumer, personal care, electronics, energy, health and personal care, and industrial end markets, and a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $183, driven by our continuous intentional shift towards higher-margin products as well as pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. Favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $35 also contributed to the increase in net sales.\nIn 2017, net sales increased by $98, or 4%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by our intentional shift toward higher-margin products due to increased demand in automotive, electronics, and consumer end markets versus less profitable commodity products, resulting in a volume increase of approximately $46, favorable price/mix shift of $46, and exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $6.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOperating Income (Loss)\n2018 vs 2017 Operating Results\nIn 2018, operating income increased by $126 and $127 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from operating income of $80 and $81, respectively, to an operating income of $206 and $208, respectively. Cost of sales increased by $247 compared to 2017, primarily due to our sales increase and its related impacts, along with $110 due to the impact of raw material inflation and $16 related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were offset by a decrease of $14 in net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7 and $8 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2017, primarily due to our announced global restructuring program, timing of services and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $2. Research and development expense increased by $5 for both Momentive and MPM compared to 2017 primarily related to the timing of new projects.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2018 increased by $8 compared to 2017, mainly due to the severance-related costs pursuant to our global restructuring program announced in March 2018 and lower gains relating to insurance reimbursements.\nOther operating loss decreased by $5, mainly due to business-related subsidies, lower scrapping of long-lived assets, and foreign currency translation gains.\n2017 vs 2016 Operating Results\nIn 2017, operating income increased by $127 and $126 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from an operating loss of $47 and $45 respectively, to an operating income of $80 and $81, respectively. Cost of sales decreased by $14 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation of $29, favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $17 and raw material deflation of $5, partially offset by the related impacts of increased sales and higher net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $27 and $28 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2016 primarily due to increase in the number of employees to sustain growth, impact of a merit increase implemented in 2016 and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $5. Research and development expense for 2017 was flat compared to 2016.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2017 decreased by $36 compared to 2016 mainly due to the gain related to an insurance reimbursement of $24 related to fire damage at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and $13 for one-time costs in 2016 triggered by the siloxane capacity transformation programs not recurring in 2017.\nOther operating loss decreased by $6, primarily due to a decrease of $8 in impairments and disposals of certain assets and equipment and a settlement gain of $2 related to the resolution of a take or pay arrangement and certain sales and use tax refunds offset by $4 due to the impacts of foreign currency translation losses.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nTotal Non-Operating Expense (Gain)\nIn 2018, total non-operating expense increased by $30, from an expense of $65 to an expense of $95, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to $11 in unfavorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities and $10 due to the incremental costs pertaining to professional fees and higher bankruptcy court fees incurred directly as a result of our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of 2014 from which we emerged in 2014.\nIn 2017, total non-operating expense decreased by $34, from an expense of $99 to an expense of $65, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $38 in favorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities offset by the gain on extinguishment of Second Lien Notes not recurring in 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, income tax expense increased by $29 compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate was 40% and 39% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2018 compared to 100% and 94% for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized. Due to fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss between jurisdictions with and without a valuation allowance established, our historical effective tax rates are likely not indicative of our future effective tax rates.\nIn 2017, income tax expense decreased by $3 compared to 2016. The effective income tax rate was 100% and 94% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2017 compared to (13%) for 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized.\nFor 2018, profits incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates greater than 21% (primarily Japan, Brazil, and China) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2017, profits and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates less than 35% (primarily China, Thailand and Japan) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2016, China, Germany, and Thailand comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, we are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive income by $23 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign currency translation positively impacted other comprehensive income by $45 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2017, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $13, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service benefit related to the effect of certain plan provision changes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $17, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service credit related to the effect of plan redesign triggered by certain changes to company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFollowing are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment. Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain other income and expenses. Segment EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA is also a principle profitability measure used to set management and executive incentive compensation goals. EBITDA and Segment EBITDA should not be considered substitutes for net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of $35 related to our automotive, agriculture, and personal care end markets, reflecting our growth initiatives across our entire portfolio, $24 of favorable price/mix shift, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $14 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies,\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $193 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to volume growth, favorable price/mix shift and contributions from past strategic capital investments, offset by start up cost related to our NXT expansion in Germany during 2018.\nFormulated and Basic Silicones\nNet sales in 2018 increased $293 or 24%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $155 driven by intentional shift towards higher-margin products and pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017, a favorable increase in sales volume of $118 reflecting improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets, as well as strong growth within our specialty portfolio driven by increased demand in electronics, construction, consumer, energy, health care and industrial end markets, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $20 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $95 to $200 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the same factors impacting net sales as well as strategic capital investments.\nQuartz Technologies\nNet sales in 2018 increased $8, or 4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to volume increase of $4 mainly due to improved market conditions in the electronics market and approximately $4 related to a favorable price/mix shift.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $45 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and volume leverage from increased sales.\nCorporate\nCorporate charges are primarily general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as shared service and administrative functions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $1 to $188 compared to 2016. The increase was impacted by temporary raw material lead/lag being addressed by pricing actions and the one-time impact of Hurricane Harvey.\nFormulated and Basic Silicones\nNet sales in 2017 increased $17 or 1%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable mix/price shift of $58 towards higher-margin products versus less profitable commodity products and $2 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, offset by volume decrease of $43 related to our intentional efforts to reduce under-performing siloxane derivative products and focus on our specialties products driven by increased demand in electronic materials, elastomers, sealants, and coatings end markets.\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $35 to $105 compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher sales of higher margin products and improved demand in automotive, consumer products, and electronic markets, improved efficiencies and raw material deflation.\nQuartz Technologies\nNet sales in 2017 increased $30, or 18%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of $30, mainly driven by improved demand in semiconductor and aerospace end markets.\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $20 to $40 compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to the sales volume increase, operating leverage, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Fiscal year 2017 also reflects full benefit of 2016 restructuring programs.\nCorporate\nCorporate charges are primarily general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as shared service and administrative functions.

This reorganization included a change in our operating segments from two to four segments. We reorganized to the new four segments model, by implementing the following:\n \u2022 financial information is prepared separately and regularly for each of the four segments; and \n \u2022 the CEO would regularly review the results of operations and assesses the performance of each of these segments. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOur operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz. The four segments model is composed of the following:\n \u2022 a new Performance Additives segment realigned from the former Silicones Segment; \n \u2022 a new Formulated and Basic Silicones segment realigned from the former Silicones segment; \n \u2022 a Quartz Technologies segment, which has been renamed from the existing Quartz segment; and \n \u2022 a Corporate segment. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and funds available under the ABL Facility. Our primary continuing liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, debt service and capital expenditures.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $1,253 of indebtedness. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had $507 in liquidity consisting of the following:\n\u2022$259 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (of which $214 is maintained in foreign jurisdictions); and\n \u2022 $248 of availability under the ABL Facility ($300 borrowing base, less $52 of outstanding letters of credit and subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that will only apply if our availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27).  Our net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $498 and $482, respectively. A summary of the components of our net working capital as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of LTM Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of LTM Net Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts receivable\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounts payable\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(286\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net working capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net working capital of $16 from December 31, 2017 was partially due to an increase in accounts receivable because of increased sales in the period offset by our strategic initiatives to expedite the collection process. In addition, inventory was impacted by the slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter. These increases were offset by an increase in accounts payable due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation as well as exchange rate fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen.\nWe remain focused on driving positive free cash flow in 2019 through our global cost control initiatives and aggressively managing net working capital. To minimize the impact of net working capital on cash flows, we continue to review inventory safety stock levels where possible. We also continue to focus on receivable collections by accelerating receipts through the sale of receivables at a discount.\nWe have the ability to borrow from the ABL Facility to support our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nOn March 2, 2018, we entered into an amendment to our ABL Facility to extend the maturity of the ABL Facility from October 2019 to March 2, 2023, subject to a springing maturity 91 days prior to the calculated maturity date for each of the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes if the principal amount outstanding for such series of notes exceeds $50 million, and increase the commitments under the ABL Facility by $30 for a total of $300, incurring $4 of fees for this amendment, which is being amortized through March 2, 2023 on a straight line basis.\n2019 Outlook\nWe believe we are favorably positioned to fund our ongoing liquidity requirements. We believe that due to our businesses operating cash flows as well as our $507 of liquidity in the form of cash and our ABL facility, our long-term debt maturities in 2021 and 2022, and our annual debt service costs of approximately $55, our business has adequate capital resources to meet material commitments coming due during the next 12-month period. We are well positioned to make strategic capital investments, leverage our leadership positions with both our customers and suppliers, optimize our portfolio and drive new growth programs. Our business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment, and these factors could have negative effects to our liquidity. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity, which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance.\nCapital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately $119, approximately $19 of which relates to certain growth and productivity projects. We remain focused on continuing to balance opportunistic and accretive growth investments with our commitment to continued de-leveraging and maintaining significant financial flexibility.\nWe expect to have adequate liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on our balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nDebt Repurchases and Other Transactions\nFrom time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as on our cash balances and liquidity, we or our affiliates may seek to acquire (and have acquired) our outstanding equity and/or debt securities or other indebtedness of the Company through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing our notes if applicable), for cash or other consideration. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $48 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for approximately $26, resulting in a net gain of $16. All repurchased notes were canceled at the time of repurchase, reducing the aggregate principal amount of these notes outstanding from $250 at the end of third quarter of 2015 to $202 as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have considered and will continue to evaluate potential transactions to reduce net debt, such as debt for debt exchanges and other transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives or combinations thereof we or our affiliates may choose to pursue in the future as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing documents.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nFollowing are highlights from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPM HOLDINGS INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources (uses) of cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash flow\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sources (uses) of cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash flow\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nIn 2018, operations generated $235 and $239 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $69 and $71 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $193 and $192 in net non-cash items, respectively, for Momentive and MPM, of which $159 was for depreciation and amortization, $26 for amortization of debt discount costs, $5 and $4 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $6 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, offset by $3 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds. Net working capital used $33 of cash primarily, due to an increase of $35 in accounts receivable because of timing of sales in the period and selling price increase and an an increase of $36 in inventories due to slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter, offset by an increase of $38 in accounts payable primarily due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2017, operations generated $113 and $115 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $0 and $1 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $168 net non-cash items, of which $154 was for depreciation and amortization, $25 for amortization of debt discount costs, $4 and $3 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $14 due to loss on impaired and scrapped assets offset by: $5 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, $6 of unrealized foreign\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ncurrency gains, $9 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to deferred income tax benefit. Net working capital used $25 of cash primarily, due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $30 and $36, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $41, primarily due to reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2016, operations generated $142 and $144 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $163 and $161 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $234 of net non-cash items, of which $185 was for depreciation and amortization, $33 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our pension benefit liabilities, $23 for amortization of debt discount costs, offset by: $12 due to loss on impaired assets, $3 of unrealized foreign currency gains, and $9 related to gain on the extinguishment of debt. Net working capital generated $7 of cash primarily driven by customer mix and timing of collections and strategic investment in profitable products, safety stock increase to support our Leverkusen, Germany site transformation and due to the strike at our Waterford, NY site. Changes in other assets and liabilities, due to/from affiliates and income taxes payable are driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, which primarily included incentive compensation, certain liabilities related to siloxane capacity transformation programs, interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2018, investing activities used $141 and $143 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $112 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $3 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $30 as cost of exercising a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd. Capital expenditures used $42 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $70 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2017, investing activities used $171 and $172 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $161 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $9 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to our acquisition of a business. Capital expenditures used $73 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $88 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2016, investing activities used $117 and $118 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. We spent $117 for ongoing capital expenditures, out of which $46 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $71 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2018, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $4 related to ABL financing fees and $47 related to repayments of short-term debt. Financing activities also provided $47 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2017, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $51 related to repayments of short-term debt and provided $50 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2016, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $16 and $17 of cash, respectively, mainly due to $48 related to repayments of short-term debt offset by $48 related to borrowings of short-term debt and the buyback of $29 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for $16. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were $52 in outstanding letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under our $300 ABL Facility, leaving unused borrowing capacity of $248.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility contains various restrictive covenants that prohibit us and/or restrict our ability to prepay indebtedness, including our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (collectively, the notes\u201d). In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing our notes, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, make investments or declare or pay any dividends. However, all of these restrictions are subject to exceptions.\nThere are certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent of such subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends, loans or otherwise, which primarily arise as a result of certain foreign government regulations or as a result of restrictions within certain subsidiaries' financing agreements that limit such transfers to the amounts of available earnings and profits or otherwise limit the amount of dividends that can be distributed. In either case, we have alternative methods to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the form of intercompany loans and/or returns of capital in such instances where payment of dividends is limited to the extent of earnings and profits.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nis considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nCovenants Under the ABL Facility and the Notes\nThe instruments that govern our indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants (and incurrence tests in certain cases) regarding indebtedness, dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions, capital expenditures and, under certain circumstances, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, as further described below. Payment of borrowings under the ABL Facility and our notes may be accelerated if there is an event of default as determined under the governing debt instrument. Events of default under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility include the failure to pay principal and interest when due, a material breach of a representation or warranty, events of bankruptcy, a change of control and most covenant defaults. Events of default under the indentures governing our notes include the failure to pay principal and interest, a failure to comply with covenants, subject to a 30-day grace period in certain instances, and certain events of bankruptcy.\nThe ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if our availability under the ABL Facility at any time was less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27. The fixed charge coverage ratio (the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\u201d) is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis and calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nIn addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, we are also subject to certain incurrence tests under the indentures governing our notes that restrict our ability to take certain actions if we are unable to meet specified ratios. For instance, the indentures governing our notes contain an incurrence test that restricts our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments, among other actions, if we do not maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio (measured on a LTM basis) of at least 2.0 to 1.0. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. The restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments under the indentures that apply as a result, however, are subject to exceptions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under the ABL Facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the notes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. We believe that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to comply with our financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, like EBITDA and Segment EBITDA, is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense.\nITEM 7.

Our contractual cash obligations consist of legal commitments at December 31, 2018 that require us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the specific vendor to provide us with future goods or services. This table does not include information about most of our recurring purchases of materials used in our production; our raw material purchase contracts do not meet this definition since they generally do not require fixed or minimum quantities. Contracts with cancellation clauses are not included, unless a cancellation would result in a major disruption to our business. These contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 and beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on fixed rate debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding of pension and other postretirement obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current maturities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Purchase obligations are comprised of the fixed or minimum amounts of goods and/or services under long-term contracts and assumes that certain contracts are terminated in accordance with their terms after giving the requisite notice which is generally two to three years for most of these contracts; however, under certain circumstances, some of these minimum commitment term periods could be further reduced which would significantly decrease these contractual obligations. \n (2) Pension and other postretirement contributions have been included in the above table for the next five years. These amounts include estimated benefit payments to be made for unfunded foreign defined benefit pension plans as well as estimated contributions to our funded defined benefit plans. The assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these projections includes a weighted average annual return on pension assets of approximately 7.50% for the years 2019 - 2023 and the continuation of current law and plan provisions. These estimated payments may vary based on the actual return on our plan assets or changes in current law or plan provisions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension and postretirement obligations. \n (3) Long-term debt amounts above represent gross repayments, and are exclusive of any unamortized debt discounts.  The table above excludes payments for income taxes and environmental obligations since, at this time, we cannot determine either the timing or the amounts of all payments beyond 2018. At December 31, 2018, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $41. We estimate that we will pay approximately $42 in 2019 for local, state and international income taxes. See Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on 10-K for more information on these obligations.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we have to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management to select the appropriate assumptions to determine these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty; therefore, actual results may differ significantly from estimated results. We base these judgments on our historical experience, advice from experienced consultants, forecasts and other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates. Deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowances based upon management's estimates of realizability.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had valuation allowances of $328 and $371, respectively, against our deferred income tax assets. At December 31, 2018, we had a $173 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $155 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany. At December 31, 2017, we had a $181 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $190 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany and Japan. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both negative and positive evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three-year period. This evidence is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain.\nWe considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n \u2022 Taxable income in prior carryback years; \n \u2022 Future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; \n \u2022 Tax planning strategies; and \n \u2022 Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. \nThe accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax return. We also apply the guidance relating to de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations. Unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Tax benefits are measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially impacted. An unfavorable income tax settlement would require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $41 and $39, respectively.\nPensions\nThe amounts that we recognize in our financial statements for pension benefit obligations are determined by actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are certain assumptions, the more significant of which are:\n \u2022 The weighted average rate used for discounting the liability; \n \u2022 The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets; \n \u2022 The method used to determine market-related value of pension plan assets; \n \u2022 The weighted average rate of future salary increases; and \n \u2022 The anticipated mortality rate tables. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nThe discount rate reflects the rate at which pensions could be effectively settled. When selecting a discount rate, our actuaries provide us with a cash flow model that uses the yields of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities consistent with our anticipated cash flow projections.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the various plans' current and projected asset mix. To determine the expected overall long-term rate of return on assets, we take into account the rates on long-term debt investments that are held in the portfolio, as well as expected trends in the equity markets, for plans including equity securities.\nThe rate of increase in future compensation levels is determined based on salary and wage trends in the chemical and other similar industries, as well as our specific compensation targets.\nThe mortality tables that are used represent the best estimated mortality projections for each particular country and reflect projected mortality improvements.\nWe believe the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and pension expense are appropriate in the current economic environment. However, as economic conditions change, we may change some of our assumptions, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table presents the sensitivity of our projected pension benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d), accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d), and 2019 pension expense to the following changes in key assumptions:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease) at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>PBO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>ABO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumption:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in discount rate of 0.5%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in discount rate of 0.5%\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in estimated return on assets of 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the relative asset allocations of plan assets in each investment category see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs events warrant, we evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, by assessing whether the carrying value can be recovered over their remaining useful lives through the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the underlying asset groups. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result, future decisions to change our manufacturing process, exit certain businesses, reduce excess capacity, temporarily idle facilities and close facilities could result in material impairment charges. Long-lived assets are grouped together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of long-lived assets. Any impairment loss that may be required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value.\nWe perform an annual assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of any events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets. If, after assessing all events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, we use a probability weighted market and income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Our market approach is a comparable analysis technique commonly used in the investment banking and private equity industries based on the EBITDA multiple technique. Under this technique, estimated fair value is the result of a market based EBITDA multiple that is applied to an appropriate historical EBITDA amount, adjusted for the additional fair value that would be assigned by a market participant obtaining control over the reporting unit. Our income approach is a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Applying this discount rate to the multiyear projections provides an estimate of fair value for the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model does not include cash flows related to interest payments and debt service, as the related debt has not been pushed down to the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for the evaluation of our goodwill recoverability are our following operating segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies.\nAt October 1, 2018, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 10%. It is possible that the conclusions regarding the impairment or recoverability of goodwill at either reporting unit could change in future periods if, for example, the reporting unit\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ndoes not perform as projected, the results of strategic plans and certain cost saving initiatives are not fully achieved, or the overall economic or business conditions are worse than current assumptions (including inputs to the discount rate or market based EBITDA multiples). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events and circumstances change, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions)\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and which involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nMPM Holdings Inc. ( Momentive\u201d) and Momentive Performance Materials Inc. ( MPM\u201d), both Delaware corporations, together with their subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or the Company\u201d), are one of the world's largest producers of silicones and silicone derivatives and a global leader in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Silicones are a multi-functional family of materials used in a wide variety of products and serve as a critical ingredient in many construction, automotive, industrial, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural uses. Silicones are generally used as an additive to or formulated product in a wide variety of, end products in order to provide or enhance certain of their attributes, such as resistance (temperature, ultraviolet light, and chemical), lubrication, adhesion or viscosity. Some of the most well-known end-use product applications include bath and shower caulk, pressure-sensitive adhesive labels, foam products, cosmetics, and tires. Due to their versatility and high-performance characteristics, silicones are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. Our Quartz Technologies segment manufactures quartz and specialty ceramics for use in a number of high-technology industries, which typically require products made to precise specifications. The cost of our products typically represents a small percentage of the overall cost of our customers' products.\nWe serve more than 4,000 customers between our Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies businesses in over 100 countries. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.\nReportable Segments\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we reorganized our segment structure and bifurcated our Silicones segment into Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones to better reflect our specialty chemical portfolio and related performance. This reorganization included a change in our reportable segments from two to four segments. Our operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz. Our reorganized segments are based on the products that we offer and the markets that we serve. At December 31, 2018, we had four reportable segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, Quartz Technologies, and Corporate.\nOur Performance Additives segment is one of the leading manufacturers of specialty silanes, silicone fluids, and urethane additives. Our liquid additives are key ingredients in our customers' products and are used to improve or enable the performance characteristics and processability of a variety of products across different end-markets including automotive, personal care, agriculture, consumer and construction. Our silicone fluids, silanes, and urethane additives Performance Additives product lines are developed using a range of raw material inputs and generally use more limited siloxane than Formulated and Basic Silicone products.\nOur Formulated and Basic Silicones segment produces electronic materials, coatings, elastomers, sealants, and basic silicone fluids focused on automotive, consumer goods, construction, electronics and healthcare end-markets. Our products enable key design features, such as extended product life, wear resistance, biocompatibility and weight reduction. Our electronic materials, coatings and sealants product lines are generally applied to our customers' products, in the form of a high-tech coating or adhesive, while our elastomers product lines are fashioned into parts by extruding or molding them in items such as gaskets or tubing. Formulated silicones product offerings are typically used to seal, protect or adhere, and often perform multiple functions at once.\nOur Quartz Technologies segment is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and non-oxide based ceramic powders and shapes. Fused quartz products are manufactured from quartz sand and are used in processes requiring extreme temperature and high purity. Momentive's high-purity fused quartz materials are used for a diverse range of applications in which optical clarity, design flexibility and durability in extreme environments are critical, such as semiconductor, lighting, healthcare and aerospace. Our product line includes tubing, rods and other solid shapes, as well as fused quartz crucibles for growing single crystal silicon. Our Quartz Technologies segment's products are the material solution for silicon chip semiconductor manufacturing.\nOur organizational structure continues to evolve. We are also continuing to refine our business and operating structure to better align our services to our customers and improve our cost position, while continuing to invest in global growth opportunities.\n2018 Overview\n \u2022 Net Sales-Net sales in 2018 were $2,705, an increase of 16% compared with $2,331 in 2017. The increase was driven by improved market dynamics in our basics end markets and volume gains across nearly all of Momentive's segments, which reflected the benefits of our strategic growth investments and increased demand in the agriculture, personal care, electronic, and industrial end markets. \n \u2022 Net Income (Loss)-Net income in 2018 was $69 and $71 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of $69 and $70, respectively, compared to net income of $0 and $1, respectively in 2017. This was primarily due to volume, mix and price increases across our product portfolio. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\n \u2022 Segment EBITDA-Segment EBITDA in 2018 was $400 and $401 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, an increase of $107 and $107, respectively, compared to $293 and $294, respectively in 2017. The increase in Segment EBITDA was driven by improved market dynamics in our basics end markets, continued growth in our specialty businesses, and the benefits of prior strategic investments in our specialty capabilities. \n2019 Outlook\nOn September 13, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with MOM Holding Company, a Delaware corporation ( Parent\u201d), and MOM Special Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d). Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of SJL Partners, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of South Korea ( SJL\u201d), KCC Corporation, a South Korean corporation ( KCC\u201d), and Wonik Holdings Co., Ltd., a South Korean limited company ( Wonik\u201d and, together with SJL and KCC, the Investors\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Momentive (the Merger\u201d), with Momentive surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The transaction is valued at approximately $3,100, which includes the assumption of net debt, pension and certain other postretirement liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Momentive, KCC, Wonik, and the investment committee of SJL and by Momentive's stockholders holding a majority of Momentive's common stock, Parent will assume Momentive's net debt obligations. Momentive stockholders will receive as merger consideration $32.50 for each share of common stock they own subject to a downward adjustment in the event that the aggregate cash held by the Company at the end of the last calendar quarter prior to completion of the Merger is less than $250. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt that will be put in place at closing. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency and is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to requisite regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nAs we look into 2019, we expect industry fundamentals to improve, and growth as a result of the capital investments we have made in our specialty product portfolio over the last several years. Despite the slowdown in China, increased macroeconomic volatility, and duty and related impacts of the US and China trade war we believe we are well positioned for continued earnings growth and margin improvement. Specifically, our NXT expansion has been completed and is expected to double our capacity in our fastest growing product line enabling state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities on two continents. We expect that this will drive growth moving forward, allowing us to strengthen our leadership position in automotive tire applications and enable additional new product offerings. In 2018, we implemented price increases across our entire silicones product portfolio which are expected to benefit us and offset inflation we are experiencing for certain raw materials. We are also well positioned to leverage our leadership positions, optimize our portfolio, and invest in and drive new growth programs. Additionally, we expect 2019 sales to continue to reflect a mix improvement as we reduce exposure to under-performing siloxane derivative products and grow our higher margin specialty products.\nWe are continuing to leverage our research and development capabilities and invest in high-growth product lines and geographical regions, positioning the Company for long-term success. We are also focused on gaining productivity efficiencies and improving margins through investments in improved operational reliability. We continue to evaluate additional actions, as well as productivity measures, that could support further cost savings. Such actions could include additional restructuring and incremental exit and disposal costs.\nIn March 2018, we announced a restructuring program totaling $15 in estimated annual run rate cost reductions with approximately $8 realized in 2018. The most recent program primarily targets selling, general, and administrative cost reductions.\nIn October 2018, we exercised a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest for approximately $30 in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd, a joint venture in China which manufactures siloxane, one of our key intermediate materials. As a result, our ownership interest in this joint venture was increased to 49% from 25%.\nWe remain focused on driving free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and optimizing net working capital, as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, in fiscal year 2019.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ( E.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit.\u201d The U.K Prime Minister triggered this process on March 29, 2017, meaning the U.K, was scheduled to leave originally on March 29, 2019. As a result of the referendum, it was expected that the British government will be negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. It is unknown what those terms will be as two earlier motions to establish these terms were not successful in the U.K. House of Parliament, causing U.K to seek an extension to exit from the E.U. which was granted by the E.U. on March 21, 2019 to happen on May 22, 2019, provided the third motion to establish the terms of exit from the E.U, is successful, otherwise the exit to occur on April 12, 2019. It is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. Currently, the Company does not expect that Brexit will have a material impact on its business.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nMatters Impacting Comparability of Results\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOur other comprehensive income is significantly impacted by foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is driven by the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary assets and liabilities driving the adjustments are cash and cash equivalents; accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment; goodwill and other intangible assets; accounts payable and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The primary currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated are the euro and Japanese yen.\nRaw Materials\nIn 2018, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion of raw materials. The largest raw material used in our business is silicon metal. The cost of silicon metal comprised approximately 12% of our total raw material costs in 2018. In 2018, inflation was felt across the entire chemical industry in raw materials, logistics and finished goods. However, to limit and minimize exposure to inflation, we contracted directly or indirectly for much of our key raw material purchases.\nNaturally occurring quartz sand is the key raw material for many of the products manufactured by our Quartz Technologies business, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. While we also use quartz sand from several global sand suppliers, one of our suppliers, a major producer of natural quartz sand, controls a significant portion of the market for this sand. In December 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with this supplier, which expires on December 31, 2021.\nWe expect long-term raw material cost fluctuations to continue because of price movements of key feedstocks. To help mitigate the fluctuations in raw material pricing, we have purchase and sale contracts and commercial arrangements with many of our vendors and customers that contain periodic price adjustment mechanisms. Due to differences in the timing of pricing mechanism trigger points between our sales and purchase contracts, there is often a lead-lag\u201d impact. In many cases this lead-lag\u201d impact can negatively impact our margins in the short term in periods of rising raw material prices and positively impact them in the short term in periods of falling raw material prices.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nResults of Operations\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\n\nNet Sales\nIn 2018, net sales increased by $374, or 16%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a volume increase of approximately $156 due to improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets and increased demand in almost all our end markets namely automotive, agriculture, construction, consumer, personal care, electronics, energy, health and personal care, and industrial end markets, and a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $183, driven by our continuous intentional shift towards higher-margin products as well as pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. Favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $35 also contributed to the increase in net sales.\nIn 2017, net sales increased by $98, or 4%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by our intentional shift toward higher-margin products due to increased demand in automotive, electronics, and consumer end markets versus less profitable commodity products, resulting in a volume increase of approximately $46, favorable price/mix shift of $46, and exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $6.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOperating Income (Loss)\n2018 vs 2017 Operating Results\nIn 2018, operating income increased by $126 and $127 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from operating income of $80 and $81, respectively, to an operating income of $206 and $208, respectively. Cost of sales increased by $247 compared to 2017, primarily due to our sales increase and its related impacts, along with $110 due to the impact of raw material inflation and $16 related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were offset by a decrease of $14 in net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $7 and $8 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2017, primarily due to our announced global restructuring program, timing of services and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $2. Research and development expense increased by $5 for both Momentive and MPM compared to 2017 primarily related to the timing of new projects.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2018 increased by $8 compared to 2017, mainly due to the severance-related costs pursuant to our global restructuring program announced in March 2018 and lower gains relating to insurance reimbursements.\nOther operating loss decreased by $5, mainly due to business-related subsidies, lower scrapping of long-lived assets, and foreign currency translation gains.\n2017 vs 2016 Operating Results\nIn 2017, operating income increased by $127 and $126 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, from an operating loss of $47 and $45 respectively, to an operating income of $80 and $81, respectively. Cost of sales decreased by $14 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation of $29, favorable exchange rate fluctuations of $17 and raw material deflation of $5, partially offset by the related impacts of increased sales and higher net processing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $27 and $28 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, compared to 2016 primarily due to increase in the number of employees to sustain growth, impact of a merit increase implemented in 2016 and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of $5. Research and development expense for 2017 was flat compared to 2016.\nA summary of the components of depreciation and amortization expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nRestructuring and discrete costs for 2017 decreased by $36 compared to 2016 mainly due to the gain related to an insurance reimbursement of $24 related to fire damage at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and $13 for one-time costs in 2016 triggered by the siloxane capacity transformation programs not recurring in 2017.\nOther operating loss decreased by $6, primarily due to a decrease of $8 in impairments and disposals of certain assets and equipment and a settlement gain of $2 related to the resolution of a take or pay arrangement and certain sales and use tax refunds offset by $4 due to the impacts of foreign currency translation losses.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nTotal Non-Operating Expense (Gain)\nIn 2018, total non-operating expense increased by $30, from an expense of $65 to an expense of $95, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to $11 in unfavorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities and $10 due to the incremental costs pertaining to professional fees and higher bankruptcy court fees incurred directly as a result of our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of 2014 from which we emerged in 2014.\nIn 2017, total non-operating expense decreased by $34, from an expense of $99 to an expense of $65, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $38 in favorable re-measurement of our pension liabilities offset by the gain on extinguishment of Second Lien Notes not recurring in 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIn 2018, income tax expense increased by $29 compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate was 40% and 39% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2018 compared to 100% and 94% for 2017. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized. Due to fluctuations in pre-tax income or loss between jurisdictions with and without a valuation allowance established, our historical effective tax rates are likely not indicative of our future effective tax rates.\nIn 2017, income tax expense decreased by $3 compared to 2016. The effective income tax rate was 100% and 94% for Momentive and MPM, respectively, for 2017 compared to (13%) for 2016. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the amount and distribution of income and loss among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the movement in the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance, which relates principally to U.S. and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, was established and maintained based on our assessment that a portion of the deferred tax assets will likely not be realized.\nFor 2018, profits incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates greater than 21% (primarily Japan, Brazil, and China) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2017, profits and losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates less than 35% (primarily China, Thailand and Japan) comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential. For 2016, China, Germany, and Thailand comprised the largest portion of the foreign rate differential.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, we are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact is considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, foreign currency translation negatively impacted other comprehensive income by $23 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign currency translation positively impacted other comprehensive income by $45 for both Momentive and MPM, primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2017, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $13, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service benefit related to the effect of certain plan provision changes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, pension and postretirement benefit adjustments positively impacted other comprehensive income by $17, primarily due to the recognition of net prior service credit related to the effect of plan redesign triggered by certain changes to company sponsored post-retiree medical, dental, vision and life insurance benefit plans.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nResults of Operations by Segment\nFollowing are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment. Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain other income and expenses. Segment EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment EBITDA is also a principle profitability measure used to set management and executive incentive compensation goals. EBITDA and Segment EBITDA should not be considered substitutes for net income (loss) or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n\n(1)Inter-segment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.\nITEM 7.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of $35 related to our automotive, agriculture, and personal care end markets, reflecting our growth initiatives across our entire portfolio, $24 of favorable price/mix shift, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $14 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies,\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $193 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to volume growth, favorable price/mix shift and contributions from past strategic capital investments, offset by start up cost related to our NXT expansion in Germany during 2018.\nFormulated and Basic Silicones\nNet sales in 2018 increased $293 or 24%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a favorable price/mix shift of approximately $155 driven by intentional shift towards higher-margin products and pricing initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2017, a favorable increase in sales volume of $118 reflecting improved market dynamics in our basics end-markets, as well as strong growth within our specialty portfolio driven by increased demand in electronics, construction, consumer, energy, health care and industrial end markets, and favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $20 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $95 to $200 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the same factors impacting net sales as well as strategic capital investments.\nQuartz Technologies\nNet sales in 2018 increased $8, or 4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to volume increase of $4 mainly due to improved market conditions in the electronics market and approximately $4 related to a favorable price/mix shift.\nSegment EBITDA in 2018 increased by $5 to $45 compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales volume, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and volume leverage from increased sales.\nCorporate\nCorporate charges are primarily general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as shared service and administrative functions. Compared to 2017, Corporate charges decreased by $2 for both Momentive and MPM, respectively, to $38 and $37, respectively, mainly due to positive impacts of previously completed global restructuring programs.\n2017 vs 2016 Segment Results\nFollowing is an analysis of the percentage change in sales by segment from 2016 to 2017:\n\nPerformance Additives\nNet sales in 2017 increased $51, or 6% compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to a volume increase of $59 related to demand in consumer, automotive, and personal care markets reflecting our growth initiatives across our entire portfolio, and $4 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, offset by adverse price/mix variance of $12.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $1 to $188 compared to 2016. The increase was impacted by temporary raw material lead/lag being addressed by pricing actions and the one-time impact of Hurricane Harvey.\nFormulated and Basic Silicones\nNet sales in 2017 increased $17 or 1%, compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable mix/price shift of $58 towards higher-margin products versus less profitable commodity products and $2 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, offset by volume decrease of $43 related to our intentional efforts to reduce under-performing siloxane derivative products and focus on our specialties products driven by increased demand in electronic materials, elastomers, sealants, and coatings end markets.\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $35 to $105 compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher sales of higher margin products and improved demand in automotive, consumer products, and electronic markets, improved efficiencies and raw material deflation.\nQuartz Technologies\nNet sales in 2017 increased $30, or 18%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of $30, mainly driven by improved demand in semiconductor and aerospace end markets.\nSegment EBITDA in 2017 increased by $20 to $40 compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to the sales volume increase, operating leverage, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Fiscal year 2017 also reflects full benefit of 2016 restructuring programs.\nCorporate\nCorporate charges are primarily general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments, such as shared service and administrative functions. Compared to 2016, Corporate charges increased by $1 and $2 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, to $40 and $39, respectively, mainly due to increase in employee headcount and related compensation expenses.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Segment EBITDA:\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\n\nItems Not Included in Segment EBITDA\nNot included in Segment EBITDA are certain non-cash and other income and expenses.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, non-cash charges primarily included asset impairment charges, loss due to scrapping of certain assets, stock based compensation expense, and net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses related to certain intercompany arrangements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, unrealized losses (gains) on pension and postretirement benefits represented non-cash actuarial losses recognized upon the re-measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations.\nRestructuring and discrete costs for all periods primarily included expenses from restructuring and integration. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these amounts also included a gain related to an insurance reimbursement of $8 related to fire damage at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and the restructuring costs related to the Company's announced $15 restructuring program. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, these amounts included costs arising from the work stoppage inclusive of unfavorable manufacturing variances at our Waterford, New York facility. For the year ended December 31, 2017, these costs also included a gain of $24 related to insurance reimbursement related to fire damage at our Leverkusen, Germany facility and $3 related to a postponed offering of our securities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these costs also included exit costs due to siloxane capacity transformation programs at our Leverkusen, Germany facility, loss of $10 due to a fire at our Leverkusen, Germany facility, and recovery of Italian tax claims from GE.\nReorganization items, net represent incremental costs incurred directly as a result of our Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of 2014 from which we emerged in 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 these amounts were primarily related to certain professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, reorganization items, net represented professional fees and bankruptcy court fees.\nSegment Realignment\nThe Financial Standards Accounting Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, defines operating segments as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we reorganized our segment structure and bifurcated our Silicones segment into Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones to better reflect our specialty chemical portfolio and related performance. This reorganization included a change in our operating segments from two to four segments. We reorganized to the new four segments model, by implementing the following:\n \u2022 financial information is prepared separately and regularly for each of the four segments; and \n \u2022 the CEO would regularly review the results of operations and assesses the performance of each of these segments. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOur operations were previously organized in two segments: Silicones and Quartz. The four segments model is composed of the following:\n \u2022 a new Performance Additives segment realigned from the former Silicones Segment; \n \u2022 a new Formulated and Basic Silicones segment realigned from the former Silicones segment; \n \u2022 a Quartz Technologies segment, which has been renamed from the existing Quartz segment; and \n \u2022 a Corporate segment. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and funds available under the ABL Facility. Our primary continuing liquidity needs are to finance our working capital, debt service and capital expenditures.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $1,253 of indebtedness. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had $507 in liquidity consisting of the following:\n\u2022$259 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (of which $214 is maintained in foreign jurisdictions); and\n \u2022 $248 of availability under the ABL Facility ($300 borrowing base, less $52 of outstanding letters of credit and subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that will only apply if our availability is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27).  Our net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $498 and $482, respectively. A summary of the components of our net working capital as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\nThe increase in net working capital of $16 from December 31, 2017 was partially due to an increase in accounts receivable because of increased sales in the period offset by our strategic initiatives to expedite the collection process. In addition, inventory was impacted by the slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter. These increases were offset by an increase in accounts payable due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation as well as exchange rate fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen.\nWe remain focused on driving positive free cash flow in 2019 through our global cost control initiatives and aggressively managing net working capital. To minimize the impact of net working capital on cash flows, we continue to review inventory safety stock levels where possible. We also continue to focus on receivable collections by accelerating receipts through the sale of receivables at a discount.\nWe have the ability to borrow from the ABL Facility to support our short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nOn March 2, 2018, we entered into an amendment to our ABL Facility to extend the maturity of the ABL Facility from October 2019 to March 2, 2023, subject to a springing maturity 91 days prior to the calculated maturity date for each of the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes if the principal amount outstanding for such series of notes exceeds $50 million, and increase the commitments under the ABL Facility by $30 for a total of $300, incurring $4 of fees for this amendment, which is being amortized through March 2, 2023 on a straight line basis.\n2019 Outlook\nWe believe we are favorably positioned to fund our ongoing liquidity requirements. We believe that due to our businesses operating cash flows as well as our $507 of liquidity in the form of cash and our ABL facility, our long-term debt maturities in 2021 and 2022, and our annual debt service costs of approximately $55, our business has adequate capital resources to meet material commitments coming due during the next 12-month period. We are well positioned to make strategic capital investments, leverage our leadership positions with both our customers and suppliers, optimize our portfolio and drive new growth programs. Our business is impacted by general economic and industrial conditions, including general industrial production, automotive builds, housing starts, construction activity, consumer spending and semiconductor capital equipment investment, and these factors could have negative effects to our liquidity. Our business has both geographic and end market diversity, which often reduces the impact of any one of these factors on our overall performance.\nCapital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately $119, approximately $19 of which relates to certain growth and productivity projects. We remain focused on continuing to balance opportunistic and accretive growth investments with our commitment to continued de-leveraging and maintaining significant financial flexibility.\nWe expect to have adequate liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future from cash on our balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under the ABL Facility.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nDebt Repurchases and Other Transactions\nFrom time to time, depending upon market, pricing and other conditions, as well as on our cash balances and liquidity, we or our affiliates may seek to acquire (and have acquired) our outstanding equity and/or debt securities or other indebtedness of the Company through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, redemption or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we or our affiliates may determine (or as may be provided for in the indentures governing our notes if applicable), for cash or other consideration. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $48 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for approximately $26, resulting in a net gain of $16. All repurchased notes were canceled at the time of repurchase, reducing the aggregate principal amount of these notes outstanding from $250 at the end of third quarter of 2015 to $202 as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have considered and will continue to evaluate potential transactions to reduce net debt, such as debt for debt exchanges and other transactions. There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives or combinations thereof we or our affiliates may choose to pursue in the future as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing documents.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nFollowing are highlights from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n\n\nOperating Activities\nIn 2018, operations generated $235 and $239 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $69 and $71 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $193 and $192 in net non-cash items, respectively, for Momentive and MPM, of which $159 was for depreciation and amortization, $26 for amortization of debt discount costs, $5 and $4 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $6 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, offset by $3 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds. Net working capital used $33 of cash primarily, due to an increase of $35 in accounts receivable because of timing of sales in the period and selling price increase and an an increase of $36 in inventories due to slow down in China experienced in the fourth quarter, offset by an increase of $38 in accounts payable primarily due to increase in purchases due to higher sales, continuous strategic efforts to improve terms and impacts of inflation. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2017, operations generated $113 and $115 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $0 and $1 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $168 net non-cash items, of which $154 was for depreciation and amortization, $25 for amortization of debt discount costs, $4 and $3 related to stock-based compensation expense for Momentive and MPM, respectively, and $14 due to loss on impaired and scrapped assets offset by: $5 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our retirement benefit obligations, $6 of unrealized foreign\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ncurrency gains, $9 related to capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to deferred income tax benefit. Net working capital used $25 of cash primarily, due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $30 and $36, respectively, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $41, primarily due to reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs. Changes in other assets and liabilities that primarily included interest expense, taxes and pension plan contributions were driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid and impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nIn 2016, operations generated $142 and $144 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. Net income of $163 and $161 for Momentive and MPM, respectively, included $234 of net non-cash items, of which $185 was for depreciation and amortization, $33 of unrealized losses related to the re-measurement of our pension benefit liabilities, $23 for amortization of debt discount costs, offset by: $12 due to loss on impaired assets, $3 of unrealized foreign currency gains, and $9 related to gain on the extinguishment of debt. Net working capital generated $7 of cash primarily driven by customer mix and timing of collections and strategic investment in profitable products, safety stock increase to support our Leverkusen, Germany site transformation and due to the strike at our Waterford, NY site. Changes in other assets and liabilities, due to/from affiliates and income taxes payable are driven by the timing of when items were expensed versus paid, which primarily included incentive compensation, certain liabilities related to siloxane capacity transformation programs, interest expense, pension plan contributions and taxes.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2018, investing activities used $141 and $143 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $112 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $3 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $30 as cost of exercising a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd. Capital expenditures used $42 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $70 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2017, investing activities used $171 and $172 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively, primarily due to $161 related to ongoing capital expenditures, net of $9 of capital reimbursed from insurance proceeds and $9 related to our acquisition of a business. Capital expenditures used $73 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $88 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nIn 2016, investing activities used $117 and $118 of cash for Momentive and MPM, respectively. We spent $117 for ongoing capital expenditures, out of which $46 related to growth and productivity initiatives and the remaining $71 related to maintenance, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2018, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $4 related to ABL financing fees and $47 related to repayments of short-term debt. Financing activities also provided $47 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2017, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $51 related to repayments of short-term debt and provided $50 related to borrowings of short-term debt. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nIn 2016, financing activities for Momentive and MPM used $16 and $17 of cash, respectively, mainly due to $48 related to repayments of short-term debt offset by $48 related to borrowings of short-term debt and the buyback of $29 in aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes for $16. Momentive and MPM did not have any other outside financing activity.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were $52 in outstanding letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under our $300 ABL Facility, leaving unused borrowing capacity of $248.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility contains various restrictive covenants that prohibit us and/or restrict our ability to prepay indebtedness, including our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (collectively, the notes\u201d). In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indentures governing our notes, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, make investments or declare or pay any dividends. However, all of these restrictions are subject to exceptions.\nThere are certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent of such subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends, loans or otherwise, which primarily arise as a result of certain foreign government regulations or as a result of restrictions within certain subsidiaries' financing agreements that limit such transfers to the amounts of available earnings and profits or otherwise limit the amount of dividends that can be distributed. In either case, we have alternative methods to obtain cash from these subsidiaries in the form of intercompany loans and/or returns of capital in such instances where payment of dividends is limited to the extent of earnings and profits.\nWe are recognizing the earnings of non-U.S. operations currently in our U.S. consolidated income tax return as of December 31, 2018 and are expecting that, with the exception of Germany and Japan, all earnings will be repatriated to the United States. We have accrued the incremental tax expense expected to be incurred upon the repatriation of these earnings. In addition, we have certain intercompany arrangements that, if settled, may trigger taxable gains or losses based on foreign currency exchange rates in place at the time of settlement. As a result, are asserting permanent reinvestment with respect to certain intercompany arrangements considered indefinite. Since the currency translation impact\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nis considered indefinite, we have not provided deferred taxes on gains of $22, which could result in a tax obligation of $6, based on currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. Should the intercompany arrangement be settled or we change our assertion, the actual tax impact will depend on the currency exchange rate at the time of settlement or change in assertion.\nCovenants Under the ABL Facility and the Notes\nThe instruments that govern our indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants (and incurrence tests in certain cases) regarding indebtedness, dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions, capital expenditures and, under certain circumstances, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, as further described below. Payment of borrowings under the ABL Facility and our notes may be accelerated if there is an event of default as determined under the governing debt instrument. Events of default under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility include the failure to pay principal and interest when due, a material breach of a representation or warranty, events of bankruptcy, a change of control and most covenant defaults. Events of default under the indentures governing our notes include the failure to pay principal and interest, a failure to comply with covenants, subject to a 30-day grace period in certain instances, and certain events of bankruptcy.\nThe ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if our availability under the ABL Facility at any time was less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and (b) $27. The fixed charge coverage ratio (the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\u201d) is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis and calculated as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nIn addition to the financial maintenance covenant described above, we are also subject to certain incurrence tests under the indentures governing our notes that restrict our ability to take certain actions if we are unable to meet specified ratios. For instance, the indentures governing our notes contain an incurrence test that restricts our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments, among other actions, if we do not maintain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio (measured on a LTM basis) of at least 2.0 to 1.0. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. The restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or make investments under the indentures that apply as a result, however, are subject to exceptions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under the ABL Facility.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and under the indentures governing the notes.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro-forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. We believe that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to comply with our financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA, like EBITDA and Segment EBITDA, is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because we use capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the indentures should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nThe following table reconciles Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and calculates the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges as calculated under our indentures for the period presented:\n\n (a) Primarily includes expenses related to our global restructuring program, siloxane production transformation, work stoppage and certain other non-operating income and expenses. \n (b) Represents professional fees related to our reorganization. \n (c) Represents net non-cash actuarial losses resulting from pension and postretirement liability curtailment and re-measurements. \n (d) Represents estimated cost savings, on a pro forma basis, from initiatives implemented or being implemented by management. \n (e) Non-cash charges primarily include the effects of foreign exchange gains and losses and impacts of asset impairments and disposals, and stock-based compensation expense. \n (f) Reflects pro forma interest expense based on outstanding indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2018 adjusted for applicable restricted payments. \n (g) MPM's ability to incur additional indebtedness, among other actions, is restricted under the indentures governing our notes, unless MPM has an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2018, we were able to satisfy this test and incur additional indebtedness under these indentures. \n (h) Represents Pro forma Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as defined in the credit agreement for the ABL Facility. If the availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time and, (b) $27, then such ratio must be greater than 1.0 to 1.0. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2018. Our contractual cash obligations consist of legal commitments at December 31, 2018 that require us to make fixed or determinable cash payments, regardless of the contractual requirements of the specific vendor to provide us with future goods or services. This table does not include information about most of our recurring purchases of materials used in our production; our raw material purchase contracts do not meet this definition since they generally do not require fixed or minimum quantities. Contracts with cancellation clauses are not included, unless a cancellation would result in a major disruption to our business. These contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations.\n\n (1) Purchase obligations are comprised of the fixed or minimum amounts of goods and/or services under long-term contracts and assumes that certain contracts are terminated in accordance with their terms after giving the requisite notice which is generally two to three years for most of these contracts; however, under certain circumstances, some of these minimum commitment term periods could be further reduced which would significantly decrease these contractual obligations. \n (2) Pension and other postretirement contributions have been included in the above table for the next five years. These amounts include estimated benefit payments to be made for unfunded foreign defined benefit pension plans as well as estimated contributions to our funded defined benefit plans. The assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating these projections includes a weighted average annual return on pension assets of approximately 7.50% for the years 2019 - 2023 and the continuation of current law and plan provisions. These estimated payments may vary based on the actual return on our plan assets or changes in current law or plan provisions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our pension and postretirement obligations. \n (3) Long-term debt amounts above represent gross repayments, and are exclusive of any unamortized debt discounts.  The table above excludes payments for income taxes and environmental obligations since, at this time, we cannot determine either the timing or the amounts of all payments beyond 2018. At December 31, 2018, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $41. We estimate that we will pay approximately $42 in 2019 for local, state and international income taxes. See Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on 10-K for more information on these obligations.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIn preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we have to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management to select the appropriate assumptions to determine these estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty; therefore, actual results may differ significantly from estimated results. We base these judgments on our historical experience, advice from experienced consultants, forecasts and other available information, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates. Deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowances based upon management's estimates of realizability.\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had valuation allowances of $328 and $371, respectively, against our deferred income tax assets. At December 31, 2018, we had a $173 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $155 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany. At December 31, 2017, we had a $181 valuation allowance against a portion of our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, as well as a valuation allowance of $190 against a portion of our net foreign deferred income tax assets, primarily in Germany and Japan. The valuation allowances require an assessment of both negative and positive evidence, such as operating results during the most recent three-year period. This evidence is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain.\nWe considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n \u2022 Taxable income in prior carryback years; \n \u2022 Future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; \n \u2022 Tax planning strategies; and \n \u2022 Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. \nThe accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax return. We also apply the guidance relating to de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations. Unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Tax benefits are measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially impacted. An unfavorable income tax settlement would require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $41 and $39, respectively.\nPensions\nThe amounts that we recognize in our financial statements for pension benefit obligations are determined by actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are certain assumptions, the more significant of which are:\n \u2022 The weighted average rate used for discounting the liability; \n \u2022 The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets; \n \u2022 The method used to determine market-related value of pension plan assets; \n \u2022 The weighted average rate of future salary increases; and \n \u2022 The anticipated mortality rate tables. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\nThe discount rate reflects the rate at which pensions could be effectively settled. When selecting a discount rate, our actuaries provide us with a cash flow model that uses the yields of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities consistent with our anticipated cash flow projections.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the various plans' current and projected asset mix. To determine the expected overall long-term rate of return on assets, we take into account the rates on long-term debt investments that are held in the portfolio, as well as expected trends in the equity markets, for plans including equity securities.\nThe rate of increase in future compensation levels is determined based on salary and wage trends in the chemical and other similar industries, as well as our specific compensation targets.\nThe mortality tables that are used represent the best estimated mortality projections for each particular country and reflect projected mortality improvements.\nWe believe the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and pension expense are appropriate in the current economic environment. However, as economic conditions change, we may change some of our assumptions, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following table presents the sensitivity of our projected pension benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d), accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d), and 2019 pension expense to the following changes in key assumptions:\n\nFor the relative asset allocations of plan assets in each investment category see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs events warrant, we evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, by assessing whether the carrying value can be recovered over their remaining useful lives through the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows of the underlying asset groups. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. As a result, future decisions to change our manufacturing process, exit certain businesses, reduce excess capacity, temporarily idle facilities and close facilities could result in material impairment charges. Long-lived assets are grouped together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other groups of long-lived assets. Any impairment loss that may be required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value.\nWe perform an annual assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of any events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets. If, after assessing all events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets, we use a probability weighted market and income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Our market approach is a comparable analysis technique commonly used in the investment banking and private equity industries based on the EBITDA multiple technique. Under this technique, estimated fair value is the result of a market based EBITDA multiple that is applied to an appropriate historical EBITDA amount, adjusted for the additional fair value that would be assigned by a market participant obtaining control over the reporting unit. Our income approach is a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate. Applying this discount rate to the multiyear projections provides an estimate of fair value for the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model does not include cash flows related to interest payments and debt service, as the related debt has not been pushed down to the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for the evaluation of our goodwill recoverability are our following operating segments: Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies.\nAt October 1, 2018, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value by more than 10%. It is possible that the conclusions regarding the impairment or recoverability of goodwill at either reporting unit could change in future periods if, for example, the reporting unit\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollar amounts in millions) (Continued)\ndoes not perform as projected, the results of strategic plans and certain cost saving initiatives are not fully achieved, or the overall economic or business conditions are worse than current assumptions (including inputs to the discount rate or market based EBITDA multiples). If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting structure or other events and circumstances change, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nThe nature and impact of recent

2017, driven by improved market dynamics, volume gains across most segments, and favorable price/mix. Net income was $69M in 2018 compared to $0 in 2017.  \n\n- Segment EBITDA in 2018 was $400M, up from $293M in 2017, due to volume growth, favorable price/mix, and benefits from strategic investments.\n\n- Cash from operations in 2018 was $235M compared to $113M in 2017. Cash used in investing activities was $141M in 2018 and $171M in 2017, primarily for capital expenditures.  \n\n- At December 31, 2018, the company had $259M of cash, $248M of availability under its ABL facility, and $1,253M of debt.\n\n- The company expects sales growth in 2019 from its strategic investments and specialty products, despite macroeconomic volatility. It plans $119M of capital expenditures in 2019, with a focus on driving positive free cash flow.\n\n- Key assumptions for pensions include a 7.5% return on assets and discount rates to determine benefit obligations. Changes in assumptions could significantly impact financial results.\n\n- Income taxes require estimates including valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $328M. Unrecognized tax benefits were $41M.\n\n- Impairment testing of goodwill uses estimates of fair value based on market and discounted cash flow approaches. No impairment was identified in 2018."}
