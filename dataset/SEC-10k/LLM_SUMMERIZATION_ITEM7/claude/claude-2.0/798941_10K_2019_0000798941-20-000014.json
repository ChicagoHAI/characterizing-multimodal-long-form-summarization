Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. ( BancShares\u201d) and its banking subsidiary, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company ( FCB\u201d). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this report. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this report for more detail. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2019, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders' equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and BancShares\u201d in this section refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares.\nYear-over-year comparisons of the financial results for 2018 and 2017 are contained in Item 7 of BancShares' Form 10-K for 2018 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 and available through FCB's website www.firstcitizens.com or the SEC's EDGAR database.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes statements and exhibits relating to plans, strategies, economic performance and trends, projections of results of specific activities or investments, expectations or beliefs about future events or results and other statements which are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nForward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expects,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d predicts,\u201d forecasts,\u201d projects,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d or similar terms or the negative of these terms, or other statements concerning opinions or judgments of BancShares' management about future events.\nForward-looking information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors which include, but are not limited to, the financial success or changing strategies of our customers, customer acceptance of our services, products and fee structure, the competitive nature of the financial services industry, our ability to compete effectively against other financial institutions in our banking markets, actions of government regulators, the level of market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest rate risk, changes in general economic conditions affecting our loan and lease portfolio, the abilities of our borrowers to repay their loans and leases, the values of real estate and other collateral, the impact of acquisition transactions and/or the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors above and other developments or changes in our business we do not expect.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, BancShares undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of BancShares are in accordance with GAAP and are described in Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions.\nThe following is a summary of the more critical areas where these critical assumptions and estimates could impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of BancShares:\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) represents the best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining the amount and timing of expected cash flows, the value of the underlying collateral and loan specific attributes impacting the borrower's ability to repay contractual obligations. Other factors such as economic conditions, historical loan losses, migration of loans through delinquency stages and changes in the size, composition and risks within the loan portfolio are also considered. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. If it is probable a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and a loss is probable, a specific valuation allowance is determined. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are generally credited to the ALLL.\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are initially recorded at fair value and are generally pooled based upon common risk characteristics. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the estimated cash flows have decreased and if so, recognize an additional allowance. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows results first in the recovery of any allowance established and then in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans.\nThe ALLL for non-purchased credit impaired ( non-PCI\u201d) loans is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in provision for loan and lease losses. General reserves for collective impairment are based on historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends. Non-PCI loans classified as impaired as of the balance sheet date are assessed for individual impairment based on the loan's characteristics and either a specific valuation allowance is established or partial charge-off is recorded.\nManagement considers the established ALLL adequate to absorb incurred losses for loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. As of January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for the ALLL and the implementation status of ASU 2016-13. See Note E, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nFinancial Measurements. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include marketable equity securities, investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Examples include impaired loans, other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), goodwill and intangible assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\nFair value is determined using different inputs and assumptions based upon the instrument being valued. Where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify market prices for similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, we look to other modeling techniques, which often incorporate unobservable inputs which are inherently subjective and require significant judgment. Fair value estimates requiring significant judgments are determined using various inputs developed by management with the appropriate skills, understanding and knowledge of the underlying asset or liability to ensure the development of fair value estimates is reasonable. Typical pricing sources used in estimating fair values include, but are not limited to, active markets with high trading volume, third-party pricing services, external appraisals, valuation models and commercial and residential evaluation reports. In certain cases, our assessments, with respect to assumptions market participants would make, may be inherently difficult to determine, and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. See Note P, Estimated Fair Values, and Note B, Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding fair value.\nIncome taxes. Management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. In estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of various tax positions considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments. Accrued income taxes payable represents an estimate of the net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon various estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nWe evaluate our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based upon the current estimate of net income, the favorable impact of various credits, statutory tax rates expected for the year and the amount of tax liability. We file tax returns in relevant jurisdictions and settle our return liabilities.\nChanges in estimated income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income, interpretations of tax laws, the complexities of multi-state income tax reporting, the status of examinations conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation or guidance as well as income tax accounting pronouncements. See Note O, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTable 2 details ASUs issued by the FASB adopted in 2019.

We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers as well as secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees generated from these products and services are a primary source of noninterest income and an essential component of our total revenue.\nOur strong financial position enables us to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions to enhance organizational value by providing opportunities to grow capital and increase earnings. These transactions allow us to strengthen our presence in existing markets as well as expand our footprint into new markets.\nThe interest rate environment, specifically the decline in short-term rates and flattening of the yield curve in 2019, has presented significant challenges to the efforts of commercial banks to generate earnings and shareholder value. While our balance sheet is asset sensitive overall, we seek to reduce volatility and minimize the risk to earnings from interest rate movements in either direction. Additionally, our initiatives focus on growth of noninterest income sources, management of noninterest expenses, optimization of our branch network and further enhancements to our technology and delivery channels.\nIn lending, we continue to focus our activities within our core competencies of retail, small business, medical, commercial and commercial real estate lending to build a diversified portfolio. Our low to moderate risk appetite continues to govern all lending activities.\nWe also pursue noninterest income through enhanced credit card offerings and wealth management and merchant services. We have recently redesigned our credit card programs to offer more competitive products, intended to both increase the number of accounts and frequency of card usage. Enhancements include more comprehensive reward programs and improved card benefits. In wealth management, we have broadened our products and services to better align with the specialized needs and desires of those customers. Services include holistic financial planning, business owner advisory services and enhanced private banking offerings.\nOur goals are to increase efficiencies and control costs while effectively executing an operating model that best serves our customers' needs. We seek the appropriate footprint and staffing levels to take advantage of the revenue opportunities in each of our markets. Management is pursuing opportunities to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability through expense control, while continuing enterprise sustainability projects to improve the operating environment. Such initiatives include the automation of certain manual processes, elimination of duplicated and outdated systems, enhancements to existing technology, implementation of new digital technologies, and actively managing personnel expenses and discretionary spending. We routinely review vendor agreements and larger third party contracts for cost savings.\nRecent Economic and Industry Developments\nVarious external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors. Based on the latest real gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) information available, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' revised estimate of third quarter 2019 GDP growth was 2.1%, up from 2.0% GDP growth in the second quarter 2019. The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter reflected a smaller decrease in private inventory investment and upturns in exports and residential fixed investment. These were partially offset by decelerations in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, and a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% in December 2018 to 3.5% in December 2019. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, nonfarm payroll employment growth in 2019 was 2.1 million, compared to 2.7 million in 2018.\nDuring the latter half of 2019, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75%. The FOMC cited the implications of global economic developments, muted inflation pressures as well as weakened business investment and exports for its actions. The FOMC also indicated that the U.S. labor market remains strong and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. In its most recent meeting, the FOMC decided to leave the federal funds rate target range unchanged. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rates, the FOMC indicated it will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2.0% inflation.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's latest estimate for sales of new single-family homes in November 2019 was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000, up 16.9% from the November 2018 estimate of 615,000. Purchases of existing homes in 2019 are also up 2.7% from a year ago.\nSimilar to the economic environment, the performance trends in the banking industry are mixed, as shown in the latest national banking results from the third quarter of 2019. FDIC-insured institutions reported a 7.3% decrease in net income compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily a result of nonrecurring events at three large institutions resulting in higher noninterest expense and realized losses on securities. Loan-loss provisions increased by 16.9% while noninterest expense rose by 5.7% from a year earlier. Banking industry average net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) was 3.35% in the third quarter of 2019, down from 3.45% in the same quarter a year ago as average funding costs outpaced average asset yields. Total loans increased by 4.6% over the past twelve months primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial loans.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $457.4 million, or $41.05 per share, compared to $400.3 million, or $33.53 per share, during 2018. The return on average assets was 1.23% during 2019, compared to 1.15% during 2018. The return on average shareholders' equity was 12.88% and 11.69% for the respective periods. The $57.1 million, or 14.3% increase in net income was primarily the result of the following:\nIncome Statement Highlights\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net interest income for the year ended 2019 increased $102.5 million, or by 8.5%, compared to the year ended 2018.

2018. The margin increase was primarily due to improved yields on loans and investments. This increase was partially offset by higher deposit costs. During 2019, yields on loans, investment securities and overnight investments increased 19 basis points to 4.58%, 19 basis points to 2.33% and 32 basis points to 2.03%, respectively.\nNet interest income was $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $102.7 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2018. Interest income increased $158.4 million primarily due to increased average loans, coupled with increased yields on loans and investments. Interest expense increased by $55.8 million primarily due to an increase in rates paid on deposit accounts.\nInterest income from loans and leases was $1.22 billion during 2019, an increase of $144.1 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased average loans in the commercial, business and residential loan portfolios as well as increased yields, primarily on commercial and business loans and equity lines.\nInterest income earned on investment securities was $161.5 million and $151.5 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $10.0 million increase was primarily due to a 19 basis point improvement in investment yields due to changes in portfolio mix and higher yield on short duration U.S. Treasury securities.\nInterest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $76.3 million in 2019, an increase of $53.8 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rates paid on money market and time deposits. Interest expense on borrowings was $16.4 million in 2019, an increase of $2.0 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and an increase in average borrowings.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $2.02 billion, or by 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in average interest-earning assets during 2019 was primarily due to organic loan growth and loans acquired from Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp, partially offset by a reduction in investments. The year-to-date taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets in 2019 improved 24 basis points to 4.04%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased time deposits and deposits from acquisitions. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 26 basis points to 0.45% in 2019 compared to 0.19% in 2018.\nWhile the full year margin increased, the Bank experienced margin compression throughout 2019, as variable rate loans and new loan production both priced lower following three decreases in the federal funds rate, coupled with higher deposit funding costs. While net interest income is expected to continue increasing in 2020, management expects net interest margin to face continued market rate pressures and initially decrease at a slower pace than the second half of 2019 before stabilizing for the remainder of 2020.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nProvision expense on non-PCI loans and leases was $33.0 million during 2019, compared to $29.2 million and $29.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases were $30.0 million, $26.5 million and $22.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases represented 0.12% of average non-PCI loans and leases during 2019, compared to 0.11% and 0.10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe PCI loan portfolio net provision credit was $1.6 million during 2019, compared to net provision credits of $0.8 million and $3.4 million during the same periods of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted a new accounting standard for estimating credit losses, CECL. The day-one impact to the allowance for credit losses is not expected to be significant. Refer to Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, as well as further information about the adoption of CECL, under the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 5\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth management services\n</td> <td>99,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardholder services, net\n</td> <td>69,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service charges and fees\n</td> <td>31,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchant services, net\n</td> <td>24,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage income\n</td> <td>21,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries of PCI loans previously charged off\n</td> <td>17,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance commissions\n</td> <td>12,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ATM income\n</td> <td>6,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable equity securities gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>20,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on investment securities available for sale, net\n</td> <td>7,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on acquisitions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>521,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total noninterest income was $415.9 million, compared to $400.1 million for 2018, an increase of $15.7 million, or 3.9%.

The effective tax rate increase in 2019 was primarily due to the 2018 recognition of a tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nINTEREST-EARNING ASSETS\nInterest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate, but expose us to higher levels of market and/or credit risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $34.87 billion in 2019, compared to $32.85 billion in 2018. The increase of $2.02 billion, or 6.1%, was primarily the result of strong originated loan growth and loans acquired in the Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares' objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow any overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, and Note C, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding investment securities.\nThe carrying value of all investment securities was $7.17 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $338.6 million when compared to $6.83 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to purchases totaling $4.95 billion and securities from acquisitions of $285.9 million, partially offset by maturities and paydowns of $2.69 billion and sales of $2.37 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2019, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $7.5 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $50.0 million as of December 31, 2018. After evaluating the investment securities with unrealized losses, management concluded that no other than temporary impairment existed as of December 31, 2019. Investment securities classified as available for sale reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.\nOn November 1, 2019, as part of the adoption of ASU 2019-04, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.08 billion were transferred from investment securities held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. At the time of the transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.15 billion. The transfer resulted in a reclassification of unrealized losses of $72.5 million, or $55.8 million net of tax, previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d). FCB still has the intent and ability to hold the remainder of the held to maturity portfolio to maturity.\nOn May 1, 2018, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.49 billion were transferred from investment securities available for sale to the held to maturity portfolio. At the time of transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.38 billion and a weighted average contractual maturity of 13 years. The unrealized loss on these securities at the date of transfer was $109.5 million or $84.3 million net of tax, and was reported as a component of AOCI. This unrealized loss was accreted over the remaining expected life of the securities as an adjustment of yield and is partially offset by the amortization of the corresponding discount on the transferred securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $19.9 million, or $15.3 million net of tax, of the unrealized loss has been accreted from AOCI into interest income.\nTable 7 presents the investment securities

groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying loans.\nLoans and Leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases depend on whether they are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCI loans consist of loans which were originated by us or purchased from other institutions that did not reflect credit deterioration at the time of purchase. PCI loans are purchased loans which reflect credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.\nLoans and leases were $28.88 billion at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $3.36 billion, or 13.2%, since December 31, 2018. Excluding current year acquired loans of $2.00 billion, total loans increased by $1.36 billion, or 5.3%. Non-PCI loans and leases were $28.32 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $24.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in non-PCI loans was driven by $1.50 billion of organic growth, primarily in the commercial, business and residential mortgage portfolios as well as the addition of $812.3 million, $139.7 million and $953.7 million in non-PCI loans from the Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra acquisitions, respectively. PCI loans were $558.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $606.6 million at December 31, 2018. The $47.9 million PCI portfolio decline over this period was a result of $149.2 million loan run-off, offset by newly acquired PCI loans totaling $101.3 million.\nNon-PCI loans and leases represented 98.1% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2019, compared to 97.6% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018.\nTable 9 provides the composition of net loans and leases for the past five

31, 2019, compared to $223.7 million and $221.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.88% and 0.94% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, the ALLL allocated to non-PCI loans and leases was $217.6 million, or 0.77% of non-PCI loans and leases, compared to $214.6 million, or 0.86%, at December 31, 2018, and $211.9 million, or 0.93%, at December 31, 2017.\nThe ALLL as a percentage of non-PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 decreased primarily due to changes in portfolio mix and sustained credit quality, coupled with impact of loan growth from recent acquisitions with no recorded allowance. This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves. Credit quality indicators such as nonaccrual assets and delinquency showed small increases but remain at historically low levels.\nThe ALLL allocated to PCI loans totaled $7.5 million, or 1.35% of PCI loans, at December 31, 2019 compared to $9.1 million, or 1.51%, at December 31, 2018, and $10.0 million, or 1.31%, at December 31, 2017.\nManagement considers the ALLL adequate to absorb estimated inherent losses related to loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. During January 2020, BancShares adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies, and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, as well as further information about the adoption of CECL, under the \"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\" section.\nTable 10 provides details of the ALLL and provision

resulting from both non-PCI and PCI loans. Non-PCI loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible. When non-PCI loans are placed on nonaccrual, all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued. Non-PCI loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Accretion of income for PCI loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows. PCI loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows.\nOREO includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold. Net book values of OREO are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if write-downs are required. The level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral, with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review. Changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset. The asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur. Valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information.\nSince OREO is carried at the lower of cost or market value, less estimated selling costs, book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined. Decisions regarding write-downs are based on factors that include appraisals, previous offers received on the property, market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market.\nTable 13 provides details on nonperforming assets and other risk elements.\nTable 13\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets decreased by $10.4 million, or 7.2%, between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans.\nTotal nonperforming assets and our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans leases and other real estate owned increased slightly but remain at historically low levels.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings ( TDR\u201d)\nA loan is considered a TDR when both of the following occur: (1) a modification to a borrower's debt agreement is made and (2) a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted. TDR concessions could include short term deferrals of interest, modifications of payment terms, or, in certain limited instances, forgiveness of principal or interest. PCI loans are aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics and each pool is accounted for as a single unit. For pooled PCI loans, a subsequent modification that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported or accounted for as a TDR as pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. Excluding pooled PCI loans, PCI loans are classified as TDRs if a modification is made subsequent to acquisition. We further classify TDRs as performing and nonperforming. Performing TDRs accrue interest at the time of restructure and continue to perform based on the restructured terms. Nonperforming TDRs do not accrue interest and are included with other nonperforming assets within nonaccrual loans and leases. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2019, accruing non-PCI TDRs were $111.7 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $109.0 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, nonaccruing non-PCI TDRs were $42.3 million, an increase of $13.4 million from $28.9 million at December 31, 2018. Both increases were primarily due to modifications within the residential mortgage, commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial portfolios. PCI TDRs continue to decline as a result of loan pay downs and pay offs.\nTable 14 provides further details on performing and nonperforming TDRs for the last five years.\nTable 14\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>17,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total accruing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccruing TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>42,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccruing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>154,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>17,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\nInterest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities were $22.83 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.15 billion from December 31, 2018, primarily resulting from growth in interest-bearing deposits of $2.71 billion, higher FHLB borrowings of $378.6 million and higher other borrowings of $134.4 million. Offsetting these increases was a decline in securities sold under customer repurchase agreements of $101.0 million.

Bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. Basel III became effective for BancShares on January 1, 2015. Under Basel III, requirements include a common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50%, Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00%, total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00% and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBasel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer in addition to the regulatory minimum capital requirements which was phased in annually over four years beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625%. At January 1, 2018, the capital conservation buffer was 1.875%. As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in at 2.50%.\nBancShares and FCB both remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 4.12% and 4.46%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. These buffers exceeded the 2.50% requirement resulting in no limit on distributions.\nAt December 31, 2019, BancShares and FCB had $128.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $32.5 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. At December 31, 2018, BancShares and FCB had $118.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $20.0 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. Under current regulatory guidelines, when subordinated debentures are within five years of scheduled maturity date, issuers must discount the amount included in Tier 2 capital by 20% for each year until the debt matures. Once the debt is within one year of its scheduled maturity date, no amount of the debt is allowed to be included in Tier 2 capital.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. ( BancShares\u201d) and its banking subsidiary, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company ( FCB\u201d). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this report. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this report for more detail. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2019, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders' equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and BancShares\u201d in this section refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares.\nYear-over-year comparisons of the financial results for 2018 and 2017 are contained in Item 7 of BancShares' Form 10-K for 2018 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 and available through FCB's website www.firstcitizens.com or the SEC's EDGAR database.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes statements and exhibits relating to plans, strategies, economic performance and trends, projections of results of specific activities or investments, expectations or beliefs about future events or results and other statements which are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nForward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expects,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d predicts,\u201d forecasts,\u201d projects,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d or similar terms or the negative of these terms, or other statements concerning opinions or judgments of BancShares' management about future events.\nForward-looking information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors which include, but are not limited to, the financial success or changing strategies of our customers, customer acceptance of our services, products and fee structure, the competitive nature of the financial services industry, our ability to compete effectively against other financial institutions in our banking markets, actions of government regulators, the level of market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest rate risk, changes in general economic conditions affecting our loan and lease portfolio, the abilities of our borrowers to repay their loans and leases, the values of real estate and other collateral, the impact of acquisition transactions and/or the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors above and other developments or changes in our business we do not expect.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, BancShares undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of BancShares are in accordance with GAAP and are described in Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions.\nThe following is a summary of the more critical areas where these critical assumptions and estimates could impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of BancShares:\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) represents the best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining the amount and timing of expected cash flows, the value of the underlying collateral and loan specific attributes impacting the borrower's ability to repay contractual obligations. Other factors such as economic conditions, historical loan losses, migration of loans through delinquency stages and changes in the size, composition and risks within the loan portfolio are also considered. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. If it is probable a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and a loss is probable, a specific valuation allowance is determined. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are generally credited to the ALLL.\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are initially recorded at fair value and are generally pooled based upon common risk characteristics. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the estimated cash flows have decreased and if so, recognize an additional allowance. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows results first in the recovery of any allowance established and then in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans.\nThe ALLL for non-purchased credit impaired ( non-PCI\u201d) loans is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in provision for loan and lease losses. General reserves for collective impairment are based on historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends. Non-PCI loans classified as impaired as of the balance sheet date are assessed for individual impairment based on the loan's characteristics and either a specific valuation allowance is established or partial charge-off is recorded.\nManagement considers the established ALLL adequate to absorb incurred losses for loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. As of January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for the ALLL and the implementation status of ASU 2016-13. See Note E, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nFinancial Measurements. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include marketable equity securities, investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Examples include impaired loans, other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), goodwill and intangible assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\nFair value is determined using different inputs and assumptions based upon the instrument being valued. Where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify market prices for similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, we look to other modeling techniques, which often incorporate unobservable inputs which are inherently subjective and require significant judgment. Fair value estimates requiring significant judgments are determined using various inputs developed by management with the appropriate skills, understanding and knowledge of the underlying asset or liability to ensure the development of fair value estimates is reasonable. Typical pricing sources used in estimating fair values include, but are not limited to, active markets with high trading volume, third-party pricing services, external appraisals, valuation models and commercial and residential evaluation reports. In certain cases, our assessments, with respect to assumptions market participants would make, may be inherently difficult to determine, and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. See Note P, Estimated Fair Values, and Note B, Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding fair value.\nIncome taxes. Management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. In estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of various tax positions considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments. Accrued income taxes payable represents an estimate of the net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon various estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nWe evaluate our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based upon the current estimate of net income, the favorable impact of various credits, statutory tax rates expected for the year and the amount of tax liability. We file tax returns in relevant jurisdictions and settle our return liabilities.\nChanges in estimated income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income, interpretations of tax laws, the complexities of multi-state income tax reporting, the status of examinations conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation or guidance as well as income tax accounting pronouncements. See Note O, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTable 2 details ASUs issued by the FASB adopted in 2019.

We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers as well as secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees generated from these products and services are a primary source of noninterest income and an essential component of our total revenue.\nOur strong financial position enables us to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions to enhance organizational value by providing opportunities to grow capital and increase earnings. These transactions allow us to strengthen our presence in existing markets as well as expand our footprint into new markets.\nThe interest rate environment, specifically the decline in short-term rates and flattening of the yield curve in 2019, has presented significant challenges to the efforts of commercial banks to generate earnings and shareholder value. While our balance sheet is asset sensitive overall, we seek to reduce volatility and minimize the risk to earnings from interest rate movements in either direction. Additionally, our initiatives focus on growth of noninterest income sources, management of noninterest expenses, optimization of our branch network and further enhancements to our technology and delivery channels.\nIn lending, we continue to focus our activities within our core competencies of retail, small business, medical, commercial and commercial real estate lending to build a diversified portfolio. Our low to moderate risk appetite continues to govern all lending activities.\nWe also pursue noninterest income through enhanced credit card offerings and wealth management and merchant services. We have recently redesigned our credit card programs to offer more competitive products, intended to both increase the number of accounts and frequency of card usage. Enhancements include more comprehensive reward programs and improved card benefits. In wealth management, we have broadened our products and services to better align with the specialized needs and desires of those customers. Services include holistic financial planning, business owner advisory services and enhanced private banking offerings.\nOur goals are to increase efficiencies and control costs while effectively executing an operating model that best serves our customers' needs. We seek the appropriate footprint and staffing levels to take advantage of the revenue opportunities in each of our markets. Management is pursuing opportunities to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability through expense control, while continuing enterprise sustainability projects to improve the operating environment. Such initiatives include the automation of certain manual processes, elimination of duplicated and outdated systems, enhancements to existing technology, implementation of new digital technologies, and actively managing personnel expenses and discretionary spending. We routinely review vendor agreements and larger third party contracts for cost savings.\nRecent Economic and Industry Developments\nVarious external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors. Based on the latest real gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) information available, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' revised estimate of third quarter 2019 GDP growth was 2.1%, up from 2.0% GDP growth in the second quarter 2019. The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter reflected a smaller decrease in private inventory investment and upturns in exports and residential fixed investment. These were partially offset by decelerations in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, and a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% in December 2018 to 3.5% in December 2019. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, nonfarm payroll employment growth in 2019 was 2.1 million, compared to 2.7 million in 2018.\nDuring the latter half of 2019, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75%. The FOMC cited the implications of global economic developments, muted inflation pressures as well as weakened business investment and exports for its actions. The FOMC also indicated that the U.S. labor market remains strong and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. In its most recent meeting, the FOMC decided to leave the federal funds rate target range unchanged. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rates, the FOMC indicated it will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2.0% inflation.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's latest estimate for sales of new single-family homes in November 2019 was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000, up 16.9% from the November 2018 estimate of 615,000. Purchases of existing homes in 2019 are also up 2.7% from a year ago.\nSimilar to the economic environment, the performance trends in the banking industry are mixed, as shown in the latest national banking results from the third quarter of 2019. FDIC-insured institutions reported a 7.3% decrease in net income compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily a result of nonrecurring events at three large institutions resulting in higher noninterest expense and realized losses on securities. Loan-loss provisions increased by 16.9% while noninterest expense rose by 5.7% from a year earlier. Banking industry average net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) was 3.35% in the third quarter of 2019, down from 3.45% in the same quarter a year ago as average funding costs outpaced average asset yields. Total loans increased by 4.6% over the past twelve months primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial loans.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $457.4 million, or $41.05 per share, compared to $400.3 million, or $33.53 per share, during 2018. The return on average assets was 1.23% during 2019, compared to 1.15% during 2018. The return on average shareholders' equity was 12.88% and 11.69% for the respective periods. The $57.1 million, or 14.3% increase in net income was primarily the result of the following:\nIncome Statement Highlights\n \u2022 Net interest income for the year ended 2019 increased $102.5 million, or by 8.5%, compared to the year ended 2018. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin was 3.77% for the year ended 2019, an increase of 8 basis points from the year ended 2018. These increases were driven by loan growth and increases in both loan and investment yields, partially offset by higher deposit costs. \n \u2022 BancShares recorded net provision expense for loan and lease losses of $31.4 million in 2019, compared to $28.5 million in 2018. Provision expense remained relatively stable due to strong credit quality, partially offset by loan growth. The net charge-off to average non-PCI loans ratio was 0.12% for the year, up 1 basis point from 2018. \n \u2022 Noninterest income for the year ended 2019 totaled $415.9 million, an increase of $15.7 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year. This was supported by our fee-income producing lines of business led by mortgage, cardholder and wealth services. Additionally, marketable equity securities gains and realized gains on investment securities available for sale increased $28.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, offset by $26.6 million in debt extinguishment gains in 2018 which did not recur in 2019. \n \u2022 Noninterest expense was $1.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.08 billion for the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to personnel, furniture and equipment and merger-related expenses. \n \u2022 Income tax expense was $134.7 million and $103.3 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 22.7% and 20.5%. The rate increase was primarily due to the 2018 recognition of a tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Act.  Balance Sheet Highlights\n \u2022 Loan growth was strong during 2019, as loans increased by $3.36 billion, or by 13.2% to $28.88 billion, primarily driven by originated portfolio growth and net loans acquired from Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra. Excluding current year acquired loans of $2.00 billion, total loans increased by $1.36 billion, or 5.3%. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.88% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, BancShares' nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loans and OREO, increased $34.4 million to $168.3 million or 0.58% of total loans from $133.9 million or 0.52% of total loans at December 31, 2018. Although nonperforming assets have increased, credit quality continues to be strong and ratios remain at historically low levels. \n \u2022 Deposit growth continued in 2019, up $3.76 billion, or by 12.3% to $34.43 billion, primarily due to organic growth as well as the addition of deposit balances from the Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra acquisitions. Excluding current year acquired deposits of $2.27 billion, total deposits increased by $1.49 billion, or 4.8%.  Capital Highlights\n \u2022 In 2019, we returned $468.6 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 998,910 shares of Class A common stock for $450.8 million and cash dividends of $17.7 million. \n \u2022 Common shareholders' equity increased to $3.59 billion on December 31, 2019, compared to $3.49 billion on December 31, 2018 as earnings exceeded share repurchases and dividends during the year. \n \u2022 Under Basel III capital requirements, BancShares remained well-capitalized at December 31, 2019, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.12%, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and common Tier 1 ratio of 10.86% and leverage capital ratio of 8.81%. \nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nFCB has evaluated the financial statement significance for all business combinations completed during 2019 and 2018.

The carrying value of loans acquired in these transactions was approximately $573.7 million at December 31, 2019. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protect us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise incur.\nAt December 31, 2019, shared-loss protection remains for a single acquired bank related to single family residential loans of $44.8 million. Cumulative losses for all fourteen acquisitions incurred through December 31, 2019, totaled $1.20 billion. Cumulative amounts reimbursed by the FDIC through December 31, 2019, totaled $674.5 million. The shared-loss agreements for two FDIC-assisted transactions include provisions related to payments owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreements if actual cumulative losses on covered assets are lower than originally estimated by the FDIC at the time of acquisition ( clawback liability\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the estimated clawback liability was $112.4 million and $105.6 million, respectively. The clawback liability payment dates are March 2020 and March 2021.\nTable 3 provides changes in the FDIC clawback liability for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 3\nFDIC

</tr>\n</table>\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Margin and Income (Taxable Equivalent Basis)\nThe year-to-date taxable-equivalent net interest margin for 2019 was 3.77%, compared to 3.69% during 2018. The margin increase was primarily due to improved yields on loans and investments. This increase was partially offset by higher deposit costs. During 2019, yields on loans, investment securities and overnight investments increased 19 basis points to 4.58%, 19 basis points to 2.33% and 32 basis points to 2.03%, respectively.\nNet interest income was $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $102.7 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2018. Interest income increased $158.4 million primarily due to increased average loans, coupled with increased yields on loans and investments. Interest expense increased by $55.8 million primarily due to an increase in rates paid on deposit accounts.\nInterest income from loans and leases was $1.22 billion during 2019, an increase of $144.1 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased average loans in the commercial, business and residential loan portfolios as well as increased yields, primarily on commercial and business loans and equity lines.\nInterest income earned on investment securities was $161.5 million and $151.5 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $10.0 million increase was primarily due to a 19 basis point improvement in investment yields due to changes in portfolio mix and higher yield on short duration U.S. Treasury securities.\nInterest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $76.3 million in 2019, an increase of $53.8 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rates paid on money market and time deposits. Interest expense on borrowings was $16.4 million in 2019, an increase of $2.0 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and an increase in average borrowings.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $2.02 billion, or by 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in average interest-earning assets during 2019 was primarily due to organic loan growth and loans acquired from Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp, partially offset by a reduction in investments. The year-to-date taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets in 2019 improved 24 basis points to 4.04%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased time deposits and deposits from acquisitions. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 26 basis points to 0.45% in 2019 compared to 0.19% in 2018.\nWhile the full year margin increased, the Bank experienced margin compression throughout 2019, as variable rate loans and new loan production both priced lower following three decreases in the federal funds rate, coupled with higher deposit funding costs. While net interest income is expected to continue increasing in 2020, management expects net interest margin to face continued market rate pressures and initially decrease at a slower pace than the second half of 2019 before stabilizing for the remainder of 2020.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nProvision expense on non-PCI loans and leases was $33.0 million during 2019, compared to $29.2 million and $29.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases were $30.0 million, $26.5 million and $22.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases represented 0.12% of average non-PCI loans and leases during 2019, compared to 0.11% and 0.10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe PCI loan portfolio net provision credit was $1.6 million during 2019, compared to net provision credits of $0.8 million and $3.4 million during the same periods of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted a new accounting standard for estimating credit losses, CECL.

The change was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Personnel expense, which includes salaries, wages and employee benefits, increased by $25.7 million, primarily driven by merit increases, increased headcount primarily driven by acquired bank personnel, increased payroll incentives and commissions and higher retirement benefit costs. \n \u2022 Merger-related expenses increased by $10.7 million primarily due to the 2019 acquisitions of Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra. \n \u2022 Equipment expense increased by $9.4 million primarily due to increased depreciation from hardware and software additions. \n \u2022 FDIC insurance expense decreased $8.2 million primarily due to the discontinuation of the Deposit Insurance Fund surcharge on large banks during 2018. \n \u2022 Collections and foreclosure-related expense decreased by $4.6 million primarily due to reductions in the write-downs of bank-owned properties. \nIncome Taxes\nFor 2019, income tax expense was $134.7 million compared to $103.3 million during 2018 and $219.9 million during 2017, reflecting effective tax rates of 22.7%, 20.5% and 40.5% during the respective periods. The effective tax rate increase in 2019 was primarily due to the 2018 recognition of a tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nINTEREST-EARNING ASSETS\nInterest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate, but expose us to higher levels of market and/or credit risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $34.87 billion in 2019, compared to $32.85 billion in 2018. The increase of $2.02 billion, or 6.1%, was primarily the result of strong originated loan growth and loans acquired in the Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares' objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow any overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, and Note C, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding investment securities.\nThe carrying value of all investment securities was $7.17 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $338.6 million when compared to $6.83 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to purchases totaling $4.95 billion and securities from acquisitions of $285.9 million, partially offset by maturities and paydowns of $2.69 billion and sales of $2.37 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2019, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $7.5 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $50.0 million as of December 31, 2018. After evaluating the investment securities with unrealized losses, management concluded that no other than temporary impairment existed as of December 31, 2019. Investment securities classified as available for sale reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.\nOn November 1, 2019, as part of the adoption of ASU 2019-04, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.08 billion were transferred from investment securities held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. At the time of the transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.15 billion. The transfer resulted in a reclassification of unrealized losses of $72.5 million, or $55.8 million net of tax, previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d). FCB still has the intent and ability to hold the remainder of the held to maturity portfolio to maturity.\nOn May 1, 2018, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.49 billion were transferred from investment securities available for sale to the held to maturity portfolio. At the time of transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.38 billion and a weighted average contractual maturity of 13 years. The unrealized loss on these securities at the date of transfer was $109.5 million or $84.3 million net of tax, and was reported as a component of AOCI. This unrealized loss was accreted over the remaining expected life of the securities as an adjustment of yield and is partially offset by the amortization of the corresponding discount on the transferred securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $19.9 million, or $15.3 million net of tax, of the unrealized loss has been accreted from AOCI into interest income.\nTable 7 presents the investment securities

groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying loans.\nLoans and Leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases depend on whether they are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCI loans consist of loans which were originated by us or purchased from other institutions that did not reflect credit deterioration at the time of purchase. PCI loans are purchased loans which reflect credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.\nLoans and leases were $28.88 billion at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $3.36 billion, or 13.2%, since December 31, 2018. Excluding current year acquired loans of $2.00 billion, total loans increased by $1.36 billion, or 5.3%. Non-PCI loans and leases were $28.32 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $24.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in non-PCI loans was driven by $1.50 billion of organic growth, primarily in the commercial, business and residential mortgage portfolios as well as the addition of $812.3 million, $139.7 million and $953.7 million in non-PCI loans from the Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra acquisitions, respectively. PCI loans were $558.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $606.6 million at December 31, 2018. The $47.9 million PCI portfolio decline over this period was a result of $149.2 million loan run-off, offset by newly acquired PCI loans totaling $101.3 million.\nNon-PCI loans and leases represented 98.1% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2019, compared to 97.6% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018.\nTable 9 provides the composition of net loans and leases for the past five

The ALLL as a percentage of total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.88% and 0.94% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, the ALLL allocated to non-PCI loans and leases was $217.6 million, or 0.77% of non-PCI loans and leases, compared to $214.6 million, or 0.86%, at December 31, 2018, and $211.9 million, or 0.93%, at December 31, 2017.\nThe ALLL as a percentage of non-PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 decreased primarily due to changes in portfolio mix and sustained credit quality, coupled with impact of loan growth from recent acquisitions with no recorded allowance. This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves. Credit quality indicators such as nonaccrual assets and delinquency showed small increases but remain at historically low levels.\nThe ALLL allocated to PCI loans totaled $7.5 million, or 1.35% of PCI loans, at December 31, 2019 compared to $9.1 million, or 1.51%, at December 31, 2018, and $10.0 million, or 1.31%, at December 31, 2017.\nManagement considers the ALLL adequate to absorb estimated inherent losses related to loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. During January 2020, BancShares adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies, and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for

resulting from both non-PCI and PCI loans. Non-PCI loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible. When non-PCI loans are placed on nonaccrual, all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued. Non-PCI loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Accretion of income for PCI loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows. PCI loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows.\nOREO includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold. Net book values of OREO are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if write-downs are required. The level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral, with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review. Changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset. The asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur. Valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information.\nSince OREO is carried at the lower of cost or market value, less estimated selling costs, book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined. Decisions regarding write-downs are based on factors that include appraisals, previous offers received on the property, market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market.\nTable 13 provides details on nonperforming assets and other risk elements.\nTable 13\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets decreased by $10.4 million, or 7.2%, between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans.\nTotal nonperforming assets and our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans leases and other real estate owned increased slightly but remain at historically low levels.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings ( TDR\u201d)\nA loan is considered a TDR when both of the following occur: (1) a modification to a borrower's debt agreement is made and (2) a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted. TDR concessions could include short term deferrals of interest, modifications of payment terms, or, in certain limited instances, forgiveness of principal or interest. PCI loans are aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics and each pool is accounted for as a single unit. For pooled PCI loans, a subsequent modification that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported or accounted for as a TDR as pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. Excluding pooled PCI loans, PCI loans are classified as TDRs if a modification is made subsequent to acquisition. We further classify TDRs as performing and nonperforming. Performing TDRs accrue interest at the time of restructure and continue to perform based on the restructured terms. Nonperforming TDRs do not accrue interest and are included with other nonperforming assets within nonaccrual loans and leases. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2019, accruing non-PCI TDRs were $111.7 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $109.0 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, nonaccruing non-PCI TDRs were $42.3 million, an increase of $13.4 million from $28.9 million at December 31, 2018. Both increases were primarily due to modifications within the residential mortgage, commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial portfolios. PCI TDRs continue to decline as a result of loan pay downs and pay offs.\nTable 14 provides further details on performing and nonperforming TDRs for the last five years.\nTable 14\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>17,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total accruing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccruing TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>42,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccruing TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All TDRs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-PCI\n</td> <td>154,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI\n</td> <td>17,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total TDRs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\nInterest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities were $22.83 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.15 billion from December 31, 2018, primarily resulting from growth in interest-bearing deposits of $2.71 billion, higher FHLB borrowings of $378.6 million and higher other borrowings of $134.4 million.

We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate, given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 28, 2020, the Board authorized share repurchases of up to 500,000 of BancShares' Class A common stock for the period February 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This authority will supersede all previously approved authorities.\nDuring 2019, BancShares repurchased a total of 998,910 shares of Class A common stock, or 9.4% of outstanding Class A shares as of December 31, 2018, for $450.8 million at an average cost per share of $451.33. During 2018, BancShares repurchased a total of 382,000 shares of Class A common stock, or 3.5% of outstanding Class A shares of as of December 31, 2017, for $165.3 million at an average cost per share of $432.78. All share repurchases were executed under previously approved authorities. Subsequent to year-end through February 14, 2020, BancShares repurchased an additional 120,990 shares of Class A common stock for $63.8 million at an average cost per share of $527.27\nDuring 2019, the share repurchases included 100,000 shares of Class A common stock purchased from Ella Anna Holding, as trustee of her revocable trust. Mrs. Holding is the widow of BancShares' former Executive Vice Chairman, Frank B. Holding, and the mother of Frank B. Holding, Jr. and Hope H. Bryant, BancShares' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman, respectively. Pursuant to the existing share repurchase authorization, the Board's independent Audit Committee reviewed and approved the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares held by Mrs. Holding on or before April 30, 2020, pursuant to BancShares' related person transaction policy.\nTable 19 provides information on capital adequacy for BancShares and FCB as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 19\nANALYSIS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Requirements to be well-capitalized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BancShares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,344,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,463,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,344,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,463,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,731,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,826,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage capital\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,344,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,463,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FCB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>8.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,554,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,315,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1\n</td> <td>6.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,554,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,315,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,837,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,574,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage capital\n</td> <td>5.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,554,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,315,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBancShares and FCB are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. Basel III became effective for BancShares on January 1, 2015. Under Basel III, requirements include a common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50%, Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00%, total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00% and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBasel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer in addition to the regulatory minimum capital requirements which was phased in annually over four years beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625%. At January 1, 2018, the capital conservation buffer was 1.875%. As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in at 2.50%.\nBancShares and FCB both remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 4.12% and 4.46%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. These buffers exceeded the 2.50% requirement resulting in no limit on distributions.\nAt December 31, 2019, BancShares and FCB had $128.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $32.5 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. At December 31, 2018, BancShares and FCB had $118.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $20.0 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. Under current regulatory guidelines, when subordinated debentures are within five years of scheduled maturity date, issuers must discount the amount included in Tier 2 capital by 20% for each year until the debt matures. Once the debt is within one year of its scheduled maturity date, no amount of the debt is allowed to be included in Tier 2 capital.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's discussion and analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of earnings and related financial data are presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. ( BancShares\u201d) and its banking subsidiary, First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company ( FCB\u201d). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented within this report. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this report for more detail. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2019, the reclassifications had no effect on shareholders' equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d and BancShares\u201d in this section refer to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for BancShares.\nYear-over-year comparisons of the financial results for 2018 and 2017 are contained in Item 7 of BancShares' Form 10-K for 2018 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 and available through FCB's website www.firstcitizens.com or the SEC's EDGAR database.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes statements and exhibits relating to plans, strategies, economic performance and trends, projections of results of specific activities or investments, expectations or beliefs about future events or results and other statements which are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nForward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d expects,\u201d plans,\u201d intends,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d predicts,\u201d forecasts,\u201d projects,\u201d potential\u201d or continue,\u201d or similar terms or the negative of these terms, or other statements concerning opinions or judgments of BancShares' management about future events.\nForward-looking information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors which include, but are not limited to, the financial success or changing strategies of our customers, customer acceptance of our services, products and fee structure, the competitive nature of the financial services industry, our ability to compete effectively against other financial institutions in our banking markets, actions of government regulators, the level of market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest rate risk, changes in general economic conditions affecting our loan and lease portfolio, the abilities of our borrowers to repay their loans and leases, the values of real estate and other collateral, the impact of acquisition transactions and/or the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors above and other developments or changes in our business we do not expect.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, BancShares undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of BancShares are in accordance with GAAP and are described in Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions.\nThe following is a summary of the more critical areas where these critical assumptions and estimates could impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of BancShares:\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) represents the best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining the amount and timing of expected cash flows, the value of the underlying collateral and loan specific attributes impacting the borrower's ability to repay contractual obligations. Other factors such as economic conditions, historical loan losses, migration of loans through delinquency stages and changes in the size, composition and risks within the loan portfolio are also considered. Loan balances considered uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. If it is probable a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and a loss is probable, a specific valuation allowance is determined. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are generally credited to the ALLL.\nPurchased credit impaired ( PCI\u201d) loans are initially recorded at fair value and are generally pooled based upon common risk characteristics. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the estimated cash flows have decreased and if so, recognize an additional allowance. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows results first in the recovery of any allowance established and then in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans.\nThe ALLL for non-purchased credit impaired ( non-PCI\u201d) loans is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in provision for loan and lease losses. General reserves for collective impairment are based on historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends. Non-PCI loans classified as impaired as of the balance sheet date are assessed for individual impairment based on the loan's characteristics and either a specific valuation allowance is established or partial charge-off is recorded.\nManagement considers the established ALLL adequate to absorb incurred losses for loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. As of January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted FASB ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for the ALLL and the implementation status of ASU 2016-13. See Note E, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nFinancial Measurements. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include marketable equity securities, investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Examples include impaired loans, other real estate owned ( OREO\u201d), goodwill and intangible assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.\nFair value is determined using different inputs and assumptions based upon the instrument being valued. Where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify market prices for similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, we look to other modeling techniques, which often incorporate unobservable inputs which are inherently subjective and require significant judgment. Fair value estimates requiring significant judgments are determined using various inputs developed by management with the appropriate skills, understanding and knowledge of the underlying asset or liability to ensure the development of fair value estimates is reasonable. Typical pricing sources used in estimating fair values include, but are not limited to, active markets with high trading volume, third-party pricing services, external appraisals, valuation models and commercial and residential evaluation reports. In certain cases, our assessments, with respect to assumptions market participants would make, may be inherently difficult to determine, and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. See Note P, Estimated Fair Values, and Note B, Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding fair value.\nIncome taxes. Management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. In estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of various tax positions considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments. Accrued income taxes payable represents an estimate of the net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon various estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nWe evaluate our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based upon the current estimate of net income, the favorable impact of various credits, statutory tax rates expected for the year and the amount of tax liability. We file tax returns in relevant jurisdictions and settle our return liabilities.\nChanges in estimated income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income, interpretations of tax laws, the complexities of multi-state income tax reporting, the status of examinations conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation or guidance as well as income tax accounting pronouncements. See Note O, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.\nCURRENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTable 2 details ASUs issued by the FASB adopted in 2019. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 2\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nBancShares conducts its banking operations through its wholly owned subsidiary FCB, a state-chartered bank organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina.\nBancShares' earnings and cash flows are primarily derived from our commercial and retail banking activities. We gather deposits from retail and commercial customers as well as secure funding through various non-deposit sources. We invest the liquidity generated from these funding sources in interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities and overnight investments. We also invest in bank premises, hardware, software, furniture and equipment used to conduct our commercial and retail banking business. We provide treasury services products, cardholder and merchant services, wealth management services and various other products and services typically offered by commercial banks. The fees generated from these products and services are a primary source of noninterest income and an essential component of our total revenue.\nOur strong financial position enables us to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions to enhance organizational value by providing opportunities to grow capital and increase earnings. These transactions allow us to strengthen our presence in existing markets as well as expand our footprint into new markets.\nThe interest rate environment, specifically the decline in short-term rates and flattening of the yield curve in 2019, has presented significant challenges to the efforts of commercial banks to generate earnings and shareholder value. While our balance sheet is asset sensitive overall, we seek to reduce volatility and minimize the risk to earnings from interest rate movements in either direction. Additionally, our initiatives focus on growth of noninterest income sources, management of noninterest expenses, optimization of our branch network and further enhancements to our technology and delivery channels.\nIn lending, we continue to focus our activities within our core competencies of retail, small business, medical, commercial and commercial real estate lending to build a diversified portfolio. Our low to moderate risk appetite continues to govern all lending activities.\nWe also pursue noninterest income through enhanced credit card offerings and wealth management and merchant services. We have recently redesigned our credit card programs to offer more competitive products, intended to both increase the number of accounts and frequency of card usage. Enhancements include more comprehensive reward programs and improved card benefits. In wealth management, we have broadened our products and services to better align with the specialized needs and desires of those customers. Services include holistic financial planning, business owner advisory services and enhanced private banking offerings.\nOur goals are to increase efficiencies and control costs while effectively executing an operating model that best serves our customers' needs. We seek the appropriate footprint and staffing levels to take advantage of the revenue opportunities in each of our markets. Management is pursuing opportunities to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability through expense control, while continuing enterprise sustainability projects to improve the operating environment. Such initiatives include the automation of certain manual processes, elimination of duplicated and outdated systems, enhancements to existing technology, implementation of new digital technologies, and actively managing personnel expenses and discretionary spending. We routinely review vendor agreements and larger third party contracts for cost savings.\nRecent Economic and Industry Developments\nVarious external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors. Based on the latest real gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) information available, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' revised estimate of third quarter 2019 GDP growth was 2.1%, up from 2.0% GDP growth in the second quarter 2019. The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter reflected a smaller decrease in private inventory investment and upturns in exports and residential fixed investment. These were partially offset by decelerations in personal consumption expenditures, federal government spending, and state and local government spending, and a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% in December 2018 to 3.5% in December 2019. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, nonfarm payroll employment growth in 2019 was 2.1 million, compared to 2.7 million in 2018.\nDuring the latter half of 2019, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to a target range of 1.50% to 1.75%. The FOMC cited the implications of global economic developments, muted inflation pressures as well as weakened business investment and exports for its actions. The FOMC also indicated that the U.S. labor market remains strong and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. In its most recent meeting, the FOMC decided to leave the federal funds rate target range unchanged. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rates, the FOMC indicated it will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2.0% inflation.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's latest estimate for sales of new single-family homes in November 2019 was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000, up 16.9% from the November 2018 estimate of 615,000. Purchases of existing homes in 2019 are also up 2.7% from a year ago.\nSimilar to the economic environment, the performance trends in the banking industry are mixed, as shown in the latest national banking results from the third quarter of 2019. FDIC-insured institutions reported a 7.3% decrease in net income compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily a result of nonrecurring events at three large institutions resulting in higher noninterest expense and realized losses on securities. Loan-loss provisions increased by 16.9% while noninterest expense rose by 5.7% from a year earlier. Banking industry average net interest margin ( NIM\u201d) was 3.35% in the third quarter of 2019, down from 3.45% in the same quarter a year ago as average funding costs outpaced average asset yields. Total loans increased by 4.6% over the past twelve months primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial loans.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $457.4 million, or $41.05 per share, compared to $400.3 million, or $33.53 per share, during 2018. The return on average assets was 1.23% during 2019, compared to 1.15% during 2018. The return on average shareholders' equity was 12.88% and 11.69% for the respective periods. The $57.1 million, or 14.3% increase in net income was primarily the result of the following:\nIncome Statement Highlights\n \u2022 Net interest income for the year ended 2019 increased $102.5 million, or by 8.5%, compared to the year ended 2018. The taxable-equivalent net interest margin was 3.77% for the year ended 2019, an increase of 8 basis points from the year ended 2018. These increases were driven by loan growth and increases in both loan and investment yields, partially offset by higher deposit costs. \n \u2022 BancShares recorded net provision expense for loan and lease losses of $31.4 million in 2019, compared to $28.5 million in 2018. Provision expense remained relatively stable due to strong credit quality, partially offset by loan growth. The net charge-off to average non-PCI loans ratio was 0.12% for the year, up 1 basis point from 2018. \n \u2022 Noninterest income for the year ended 2019 totaled $415.9 million, an increase of $15.7 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year. This was supported by our fee-income producing lines of business led by mortgage, cardholder and wealth services. Additionally, marketable equity securities gains and realized gains on investment securities available for sale increased $28.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, offset by $26.6 million in debt extinguishment gains in 2018 which did not recur in 2019. \n \u2022 Noninterest expense was $1.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.08 billion for the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to personnel, furniture and equipment and merger-related expenses. \n \u2022 Income tax expense was $134.7 million and $103.3 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 22.7% and 20.5%. The rate increase was primarily due to the 2018 recognition of a tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Act.  Balance Sheet Highlights\n \u2022 Loan growth was strong during 2019, as loans increased by $3.36 billion, or by 13.2% to $28.88 billion, primarily driven by originated portfolio growth and net loans acquired from Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra. Excluding current year acquired loans of $2.00 billion, total loans increased by $1.36 billion, or 5.3%. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.88% at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, BancShares' nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loans and OREO, increased $34.4 million to $168.3 million or 0.58% of total loans from $133.9 million or 0.52% of total loans at December 31, 2018. Although nonperforming assets have increased, credit quality continues to be strong and ratios remain at historically low levels. \n \u2022 Deposit growth continued in 2019, up $3.76 billion, or by 12.3% to $34.43 billion, primarily due to organic growth as well as the addition of deposit balances from the Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra acquisitions. Excluding current year acquired deposits of $2.27 billion, total deposits increased by $1.49 billion, or 4.8%.  Capital Highlights\n \u2022 In 2019, we returned $468.6 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 998,910 shares of Class A common stock for $450.8 million and cash dividends of $17.7 million. \n \u2022 Common shareholders' equity increased to $3.59 billion on December 31, 2019, compared to $3.49 billion on December 31, 2018 as earnings exceeded share repurchases and dividends during the year. \n \u2022 Under Basel III capital requirements, BancShares remained well-capitalized at December 31, 2019, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.12%, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and common Tier 1 ratio of 10.86% and leverage capital ratio of 8.81%. \nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nFCB has evaluated the financial statement significance for all business combinations completed during 2019 and 2018.

The carrying value of loans acquired in these transactions was approximately $573.7 million at December 31, 2019. Nine of the fourteen FDIC-assisted transactions included shared-loss agreements which, for their terms, protect us from a substantial portion of the credit and asset quality risk we would otherwise incur.\nAt December 31, 2019, shared-loss protection remains for a single acquired bank related to single family residential loans of $44.8 million. Cumulative losses for all fourteen acquisitions incurred through December 31, 2019, totaled $1.20 billion. Cumulative amounts reimbursed by the FDIC through December 31, 2019, totaled $674.5 million. The shared-loss agreements for two FDIC-assisted transactions include provisions related to payments owed to the FDIC at the termination of the agreements if actual cumulative losses on covered assets are lower than originally estimated by the FDIC at the time of acquisition ( clawback liability\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the estimated clawback liability was $112.4 million and $105.6 million, respectively. The clawback liability payment dates are March 2020 and March 2021.\nTable 3 provides changes in the FDIC clawback liability for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 3\nFDIC CLAWBACK LIABILITY\n\nTable 4\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS\n\n(1)Loans and leases include PCI and non-PCI loans, nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale. Interest income on loans and leases includes accretion income and loan fees. Loan fees were $9.7 million, $8.8 million, and $9.7 million for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Yields related to loans, leases and securities exempt from both federal and state income taxes, federal income taxes only, or state income taxes only are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming statutory federal income tax rates of 21.0% for 2019 and 2018, and 35.0% for 2017, as well as state income tax rates of 3.9%, 3.4%, and 3.1% for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustment was $3.6 million, $3.4 million, and $4.5 million, for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n(2)The rate/volume variance is allocated proportionally between the changes in volume and rate.\nTable 4\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS (continued)\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Margin and Income (Taxable Equivalent Basis)\nThe year-to-date taxable-equivalent net interest margin for 2019 was 3.77%, compared to 3.69% during 2018. The margin increase was primarily due to improved yields on loans and investments. This increase was partially offset by higher deposit costs. During 2019, yields on loans, investment securities and overnight investments increased 19 basis points to 4.58%, 19 basis points to 2.33% and 32 basis points to 2.03%, respectively.\nNet interest income was $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $102.7 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2018. Interest income increased $158.4 million primarily due to increased average loans, coupled with increased yields on loans and investments. Interest expense increased by $55.8 million primarily due to an increase in rates paid on deposit accounts.\nInterest income from loans and leases was $1.22 billion during 2019, an increase of $144.1 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased average loans in the commercial, business and residential loan portfolios as well as increased yields, primarily on commercial and business loans and equity lines.\nInterest income earned on investment securities was $161.5 million and $151.5 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $10.0 million increase was primarily due to a 19 basis point improvement in investment yields due to changes in portfolio mix and higher yield on short duration U.S. Treasury securities.\nInterest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $76.3 million in 2019, an increase of $53.8 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rates paid on money market and time deposits. Interest expense on borrowings was $16.4 million in 2019, an increase of $2.0 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and an increase in average borrowings.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $2.02 billion, or by 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Growth in average interest-earning assets during 2019 was primarily due to organic loan growth and loans acquired from Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp, partially offset by a reduction in investments. The year-to-date taxable-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets in 2019 improved 24 basis points to 4.04%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased time deposits and deposits from acquisitions. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 26 basis points to 0.45% in 2019 compared to 0.19% in 2018.\nWhile the full year margin increased, the Bank experienced margin compression throughout 2019, as variable rate loans and new loan production both priced lower following three decreases in the federal funds rate, coupled with higher deposit funding costs. While net interest income is expected to continue increasing in 2020, management expects net interest margin to face continued market rate pressures and initially decrease at a slower pace than the second half of 2019 before stabilizing for the remainder of 2020.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nProvision expense on non-PCI loans and leases was $33.0 million during 2019, compared to $29.2 million and $29.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases were $30.0 million, $26.5 million and $22.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs on non-PCI loans and leases represented 0.12% of average non-PCI loans and leases during 2019, compared to 0.11% and 0.10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe PCI loan portfolio net provision credit was $1.6 million during 2019, compared to net provision credits of $0.8 million and $3.4 million during the same periods of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2020, BancShares adopted a new accounting standard for estimating credit losses, CECL. The day-one impact to the allowance for credit losses is not expected to be significant. Refer to Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, as well as further information about the adoption of CECL, under the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d section.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 5\nNONINTEREST INCOME\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total noninterest income was $415.9 million, compared to $400.1 million for 2018, an increase of $15.7 million, or 3.9%. The change was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Marketable equity securities gains increased income by $28.2 million due to favorable movements in the stock market throughout 2019. \n \u2022 Realized gains on investment securities available for sale increased $6.8 million due primarily to gains recognized on sales of mortgage-backed securities. \n \u2022 Mortgage income increased $4.7 million primarily due to favorable mortgage interest rate movements and higher sales volumes. \n \u2022 Cardholder services income increased by $3.6 million due to an increase in sales volume and cost savings achieved by converting credit card processing services. \n \u2022 The gain on extinguishment of debt of $26.6 million due to the early termination of FHLB advances in 2018 did not recur in 2019. \nNoninterest Expense\nTable 6\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total noninterest expense was $1.10 billion, compared to $1.08 billion for 2018, an increase of $26.8 million, or 2.5%. The change was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 Personnel expense, which includes salaries, wages and employee benefits, increased by $25.7 million, primarily driven by merit increases, increased headcount primarily driven by acquired bank personnel, increased payroll incentives and commissions and higher retirement benefit costs. \n \u2022 Merger-related expenses increased by $10.7 million primarily due to the 2019 acquisitions of Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra. \n \u2022 Equipment expense increased by $9.4 million primarily due to increased depreciation from hardware and software additions. \n \u2022 FDIC insurance expense decreased $8.2 million primarily due to the discontinuation of the Deposit Insurance Fund surcharge on large banks during 2018. \n \u2022 Collections and foreclosure-related expense decreased by $4.6 million primarily due to reductions in the write-downs of bank-owned properties. \nIncome Taxes\nFor 2019, income tax expense was $134.7 million compared to $103.3 million during 2018 and $219.9 million during 2017, reflecting effective tax rates of 22.7%, 20.5% and 40.5% during the respective periods. The effective tax rate increase in 2019 was primarily due to the 2018 recognition of a tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nINTEREST-EARNING ASSETS\nInterest-earning assets include overnight investments, investment securities and loans and leases, all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset. Higher risk investments typically carry a higher interest rate, but expose us to higher levels of market and/or credit risk. We strive to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets, while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum.\nInterest-earning assets averaged $34.87 billion in 2019, compared to $32.85 billion in 2018. The increase of $2.02 billion, or 6.1%, was primarily the result of strong originated loan growth and loans acquired in the Biscayne Bancshares and First South Bancorp acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities.\nInvestment Securities\nThe primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities that have minimal liquidity risk and low to moderate interest rate risk and credit risk. Other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity, serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with BancShares' objectives. Additionally, purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a long-term earnings optimization strategy. Changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance. Generally, when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand, we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio or into overnight investments. Conversely, when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and short-term borrowings, we allow any overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, and Note C, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding investment securities.\nThe carrying value of all investment securities was $7.17 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $338.6 million when compared to $6.83 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in the portfolio was primarily attributable to purchases totaling $4.95 billion and securities from acquisitions of $285.9 million, partially offset by maturities and paydowns of $2.69 billion and sales of $2.37 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2019, investment securities available for sale had a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $7.5 million, compared to a net pre-tax unrealized loss of $50.0 million as of December 31, 2018. After evaluating the investment securities with unrealized losses, management concluded that no other than temporary impairment existed as of December 31, 2019. Investment securities classified as available for sale reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.\nOn November 1, 2019, as part of the adoption of ASU 2019-04, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.08 billion were transferred from investment securities held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. At the time of the transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.15 billion. The transfer resulted in a reclassification of unrealized losses of $72.5 million, or $55.8 million net of tax, previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d). FCB still has the intent and ability to hold the remainder of the held to maturity portfolio to maturity.\nOn May 1, 2018, mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $2.49 billion were transferred from investment securities available for sale to the held to maturity portfolio. At the time of transfer, the mortgage-backed securities had a fair value of $2.38 billion and a weighted average contractual maturity of 13 years. The unrealized loss on these securities at the date of transfer was $109.5 million or $84.3 million net of tax, and was reported as a component of AOCI. This unrealized loss was accreted over the remaining expected life of the securities as an adjustment of yield and is partially offset by the amortization of the corresponding discount on the transferred securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $19.9 million, or $15.3 million net of tax, of the unrealized loss has been accreted from AOCI into interest income.\nTable 7 presents the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2019 segregated by major category.\nTable 7\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nAt December 31, 2019, mortgage-backed securities represented 78.7% of the total fair value of investment securities, compared to government agency securities (9.5%), U.S. Treasury (5.7%), corporate bonds (2.8%), state, county and municipal securities (1.6%), marketable equity securities (1.1%) and other investments (0.4%). Overnight investments are with the Federal Reserve Bank and other financial institutions.\nTable 8 presents the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2019 segregated by major category with ranges of contractual maturities, average contractual maturities and taxable equivalent yields.\nTable 8\nINVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\n(1) Government agency, residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying loans.\nLoans and Leases\nOur accounting methods for loans and leases depend on whether they are originated or purchased, and if purchased, whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCI loans consist of loans which were originated by us or purchased from other institutions that did not reflect credit deterioration at the time of purchase. PCI loans are purchased loans which reflect credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.\nLoans and leases were $28.88 billion at December 31, 2019, a net increase of $3.36 billion, or 13.2%, since December 31, 2018. Excluding current year acquired loans of $2.00 billion, total loans increased by $1.36 billion, or 5.3%. Non-PCI loans and leases were $28.32 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $24.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in non-PCI loans was driven by $1.50 billion of organic growth, primarily in the commercial, business and residential mortgage portfolios as well as the addition of $812.3 million, $139.7 million and $953.7 million in non-PCI loans from the Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp and Entegra acquisitions, respectively. PCI loans were $558.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $606.6 million at December 31, 2018. The $47.9 million PCI portfolio decline over this period was a result of $149.2 million loan run-off, offset by newly acquired PCI loans totaling $101.3 million.\nNon-PCI loans and leases represented 98.1% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2019, compared to 97.6% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018.\nTable 9 provides the composition of net loans and leases for the past five years.\nTable 9\nLOANS AND LEASES\n\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nThe ALLL was $225.1 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $223.7 million and $221.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of total loans was 0.78% at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.88% and 0.94% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, the ALLL allocated to non-PCI loans and leases was $217.6 million, or 0.77% of non-PCI loans and leases, compared to $214.6 million, or 0.86%, at December 31, 2018, and $211.9 million, or 0.93%, at December 31, 2017.\nThe ALLL as a percentage of non-PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 decreased primarily due to changes in portfolio mix and sustained credit quality, coupled with impact of loan growth from recent acquisitions with no recorded allowance. This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves. Credit quality indicators such as nonaccrual assets and delinquency showed small increases but remain at historically low levels.\nThe ALLL allocated to PCI loans totaled $7.5 million, or 1.35% of PCI loans, at December 31, 2019 compared to $9.1 million, or 1.51%, at December 31, 2018, and $10.0 million, or 1.31%, at December 31, 2017.\nManagement considers the ALLL adequate to absorb estimated inherent losses related to loans and leases outstanding at December 31, 2019. During January 2020, BancShares adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changed the methodology, accounting policies, and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, as well as further information about the adoption of CECL, under the \"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\" section.\nTable 10 provides details of the ALLL and provision components by loan class for the past five years.\nTable 10\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES\n\nTable 11 provides trends of the ALLL ratios for the past five years.\nTable 11\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES RATIOS\n\nTable 12 details the allocation of the ALLL among the various loan types. See Note E, Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding the ALLL.\nTable 12\nALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES\n\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and OREO resulting from both non-PCI and PCI loans. Non-PCI loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible. When non-PCI loans are placed on nonaccrual, all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued. Non-PCI loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Accretion of income for PCI loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows. PCI loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows.\nOREO includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold. Net book values of OREO are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if write-downs are required. The level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral, with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review. Changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset. The asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur. Valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information.\nSince OREO is carried at the lower of cost or market value, less estimated selling costs, book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined. Decisions regarding write-downs are based on factors that include appraisals, previous offers received on the property, market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market.\nTable 13 provides details on nonperforming assets and other risk elements.\nTable 13\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\n\nFor the year ended 2019, nonperforming assets increased by $34.4 million, or 25.7%, compared to December 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets decreased by $10.4 million, or 7.2%, between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans.\nTotal nonperforming assets and our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans leases and other real estate owned increased slightly but remain at historically low levels.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings ( TDR\u201d)\nA loan is considered a TDR when both of the following occur: (1) a modification to a borrower's debt agreement is made and (2) a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted. TDR concessions could include short term deferrals of interest, modifications of payment terms, or, in certain limited instances, forgiveness of principal or interest. PCI loans are aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics and each pool is accounted for as a single unit. For pooled PCI loans, a subsequent modification that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR is not reported or accounted for as a TDR as pooled PCI loans are excluded from the scope of TDR accounting. Excluding pooled PCI loans, PCI loans are classified as TDRs if a modification is made subsequent to acquisition. We further classify TDRs as performing and nonperforming. Performing TDRs accrue interest at the time of restructure and continue to perform based on the restructured terms. Nonperforming TDRs do not accrue interest and are included with other nonperforming assets within nonaccrual loans and leases. See Note A, Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting policies for TDRs.\nAt December 31, 2019, accruing non-PCI TDRs were $111.7 million, an increase of $2.7 million from $109.0 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, nonaccruing non-PCI TDRs were $42.3 million, an increase of $13.4 million from $28.9 million at December 31, 2018. Both increases were primarily due to modifications within the residential mortgage, commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial portfolios. PCI TDRs continue to decline as a result of loan pay downs and pay offs.\nTable 14 provides further details on performing and nonperforming TDRs for the last five years.\nTable 14\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS\n\nINTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\nInterest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securities sold under customer repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, subordinated debentures, and other borrowings. Interest-bearing liabilities were $22.83 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.15 billion from December 31, 2018, primarily resulting from growth in interest-bearing deposits of $2.71 billion, higher FHLB borrowings of $378.6 million and higher other borrowings of $134.4 million. Offsetting these increases was a decline in securities sold under customer repurchase agreements of $101.0 million. Current year acquisitions contributed to $1.83 billion, $167.0 million and $27.1 million in interest-bearing deposits, FHLB borrowings and subordinated debentures, respectively, at December 31, 2019.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.40 billion, or by 7.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to growth in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $1.37 billion.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2019, total deposits were $34.43 billion, an increase of $3.76 billion, or 12.3%, since 2018. The Biscayne Bancshares, First South Bancorp, and Entegra acquisitions contributed total deposit balances of $780.0 million, $166.8 million and $1.33 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Excluding acquired deposits, demand deposits increased $597.9 million, money market deposits increased $348.8 million, and time deposits increased $329.9 million during 2019.\nTable 15 provides deposit balances as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 15\nDEPOSITS\n\nDue to our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, core deposit retention remains a key business objective. We believe that traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers but, as economic conditions improve, we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn and invested elsewhere. Our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost.\nTable 16 provides the expected maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 16\nMATURITIES OF TIME DEPOSITS OF $100,000 OR MORE\n\nBorrowings\nAt December 31, 2019, total borrowings were $1.33 billion compared to $892.2 million at December 31, 2018. The $434.7 million increase was primarily due to an increase in FHLB borrowings of $378.6 million and an increase in other borrowings of $134.4 million primarily related to issuance of a term loan and revolving line of credit in 2019.\nTable 17\nBORROWINGS\n\nBancShares owns five special purpose entities - SCB Capital Trust I, FCB/SC Capital Trust II, FCB/NC Capital Trust III, CCBI Capital Trust I, and Macon Capital Trust I (the Trusts\u201d), which mature in 2036, 2034, 2034, 2036, and 2034, respectively. Subordinated debentures included junior subordinated debentures representing obligations to the Trusts, which may be redeemed at par in whole or in part at any time. BancShares has guaranteed all obligations of the Trusts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, FCB redeemed, in whole, all obligations related to CCBI Capital Trust I totaling $4.1 million.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nTable 18 identifies significant obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 representing required and potential cash outflows. See Note T, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information regarding total commitments. Loans commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.\nTable 18\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\nWe are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors and shareholders. We continually monitor the capital levels and ratios for BancShares and FCB to ensure they exceed the minimum requirements imposed by regulatory authorities and to ensure they are appropriate, given growth projections, risk profile and potential changes in the regulatory environment. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 28, 2020, the Board authorized share repurchases of up to 500,000 of BancShares' Class A common stock for the period February 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. This authority will supersede all previously approved authorities.\nDuring 2019, BancShares repurchased a total of 998,910 shares of Class A common stock, or 9.4% of outstanding Class A shares as of December 31, 2018, for $450.8 million at an average cost per share of $451.33. During 2018, BancShares repurchased a total of 382,000 shares of Class A common stock, or 3.5% of outstanding Class A shares of as of December 31, 2017, for $165.3 million at an average cost per share of $432.78. All share repurchases were executed under previously approved authorities. Subsequent to year-end through February 14, 2020, BancShares repurchased an additional 120,990 shares of Class A common stock for $63.8 million at an average cost per share of $527.27\nDuring 2019, the share repurchases included 100,000 shares of Class A common stock purchased from Ella Anna Holding, as trustee of her revocable trust. Mrs. Holding is the widow of BancShares' former Executive Vice Chairman, Frank B. Holding, and the mother of Frank B. Holding, Jr. and Hope H. Bryant, BancShares' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman, respectively. Pursuant to the existing share repurchase authorization, the Board's independent Audit Committee reviewed and approved the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares held by Mrs. Holding on or before April 30, 2020, pursuant to BancShares' related person transaction policy.\nTable 19 provides information on capital adequacy for BancShares and FCB as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 19\nANALYSIS OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\nBancShares and FCB are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines ( Basel III\u201d) aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. Basel III became effective for BancShares on January 1, 2015. Under Basel III, requirements include a common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50%, Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00%, total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00% and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBasel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer in addition to the regulatory minimum capital requirements which was phased in annually over four years beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625%. At January 1, 2018, the capital conservation buffer was 1.875%. As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer was fully phased in at 2.50%.\nBancShares and FCB both remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. BancShares and FCB had capital conservation buffers of 4.12% and 4.46%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. These buffers exceeded the 2.50% requirement resulting in no limit on distributions.\nAt December 31, 2019, BancShares and FCB had $128.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $32.5 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. At December 31, 2018, BancShares and FCB had $118.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively, of trust preferred capital securities and $20.0 million of qualifying subordinated debentures included in Tier 2 capital. Under current regulatory guidelines, when subordinated debentures are within five years of scheduled maturity date, issuers must discount the amount included in Tier 2 capital by 20% for each year until the debt matures. Once the debt is within one year of its scheduled maturity date, no amount of the debt is allowed to be included in Tier 2 capital.", "item_7_tables": "Table 22: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>
