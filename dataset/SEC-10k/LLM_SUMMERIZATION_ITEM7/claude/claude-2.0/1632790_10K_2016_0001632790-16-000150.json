Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou should read the following MD&A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see above Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nAll amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of Energizer. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"expectation,\" \"anticipate,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"belief,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market and economic conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market trends in the categories in which we compete;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the success of new products and the ability to continually develop and market new products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to attract, retain and improve distribution with key customers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to continue planned advertising and other promotional spending;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to timely execute strategic initiatives, including restructurings, and international go-to-market changes in a manner that will positively impact our financial condition and results of operations and does not disrupt our business operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of strategic initiatives, including restructurings, on our relationships with employees, customers and vendors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to maintain and improve market share in the categories in which we operate despite heightened competitive pressure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to improve operations and realize cost savings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls, as well as offsetting hedges, including the impact of the United Kingdom's referendum vote and announced intention to exit the European Union at some future date;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of raw materials and other commodity costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs and reputational damage associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to acquire and integrate businesses, and to realize the projected results of acquisitions, including our ability to integrate the auto care acquisition successfully and to achieve the anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other anticipated benefits;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of advertising and product liability claims and other litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>compliance with debt covenants and maintenance of credit ratings as well as the impact of interest and principal repayment of our existing and any future debt; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of legislative or regulatory determinations or changes by federal, state and local, and foreign authorities, including taxing authorities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial could affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. The list of factors above is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Additional risks and uncertainties include those described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Report, as updated from time to time in the Company's public filings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period and assist investors in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our four geographic segments including allocations for shared IT and finance functions. General corporate and other expenses, Global marketing expenses, Research and development (R&D) expenses, Amortization of intangible assets, interest expense and charges related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructuring, the acquisition fair value inventory step up (inventory step up), acquisition and integration have all been excluded from segment profit.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Taxes, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS. These measures exclude the impact of the costs related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructurings, acquisition and integration, cost of early debt retirement, inventory step up and adjustments to prior year tax accruals.\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue, segment profit or other margins that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of our go-to-market initiatives, the change in our Venezuela results from the deconsolidation of those operations, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\nInternational Go-to-market initiatives. To compete more effectively as an independent company, we increased our use of exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers, and decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries, consistent with our international go-to-market strategy. In order to capture the impact of these international go-to-market changes and exits, we have separately identified the impact of these changes, which represents the year over year change in those markets since the date of exit. The impact from these changes was fully realized during the third quarter 2016.\nChange in Venezuela Results. As previously announced, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results do not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. As a result of the deconsolidation, we have taken the year over year change in Venezuela results and separately identified the impact in our change in sales and segment profit.\nImpact of acquisition. On July 1, 2016, Energizer completed its auto care acquisition. This includes the impact the auto care acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs or the one time inventory fair value step up costs associated with the auto care acquisition.\nImpact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to spin-off, restructuring, inventory step up, and acquisition and integration.\nAcquisition\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products, for a total purchase price of $340.0 plus working capital adjustments of $4.0, net of acquired cash. The Company financed the acquisition with $300.0 of cash on hand and $44.0 of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility (Revolving Facility). The Company initially utilized a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility to complete the transaction. Later in July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand. The Company incurred an additional $1.2 of interest expense in July related to this outstanding bridge loan. The Company did not incur incremental U.S. taxes from utilizing foreign cash for this transaction.\nWith the auto care acquisition, Energizer's brands now include Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL and Eagle One. The acquisition will allow the Company to expand its portfolio, increase presence at existing customers, and utilize its scale and global supply chain to drive efficiencies.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs, $1.2 of interest expense associated with the bridge loan and $8.1 of additional costs of products sold related to the inventory fair market value step up on the acquisition date. Total acquisition and integration related costs associated with the auto care acquisition are expected to be in the range of $25 to $30. We expect to incur the remaining costs during fiscal year 2017.\nThe Separation\nOn July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from Edgewell via a tax free spin-off. To effect the separation, Edgewell, undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities. As a result of these transactions, Energizer now holds the Household Products' product group and Edgewell holds the Personal Care product group. As a result of the Spin-off, Energizer now operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol \"ENR.\"\nIn conjunction with the Spin-off, Edgewell distributed 62,193,281 shares of Energizer common stock to its shareholders. Under the terms of the Spin-off, Edgewell common stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 16, 2015, the record date for the distribution, received one share in Energizer for each share of Edgewell common stock they held. Edgewell completed the distribution of Energizer common stock to its shareholders on July 1, 2015, the distribution date. The transaction was structured to be tax-free to its U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEnergizer's first three fiscal quarters of 2015 as well as all of 2014 are based on carve out financial data. Net sales, Gross profit, Advertising & promotion (A&P) and R&D spending are directly attributable to our business. However, certain SG&A, Interest expense, including the cost of early debt retirement, and Spin-off and Restructuring related charges are allocated from Edgewell and not necessarily representative of Energizer's stand-alone results or expected future results of Energizer as an independent company.\nOverview\nGeneral\nEnergizer, through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the world's largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. Energizer manufactures, markets and/or licenses one of the most extensive product portfolios of household batteries, specialty batteries and portable lights. Energizer is the beneficiary of over 100 years of expertise in the battery and portable lighting products industries. Its brand names, Energizer and Eveready, have worldwide recognition for innovation, quality and dependability, and are marketed and sold around the world.\nEnergizer has a long history of innovation within our categories. Since our commercialization of the first dry-cell battery in 1893 and the first flashlight in 1899, we have been committed to developing and marketing new products to meet evolving consumer needs and consistently advancing battery technology as the universe of devices powered by batteries has evolved. Over the past 100+ years we have developed or brought to market:\n\u2022 the first flashlight;\n\u2022 the first mercury-free alkaline battery;\n\u2022 the first mercury-free hearing aid battery;\n\u2022 Energizer Ultimate Lithium, the world's longest-lasting AA and AAA battery for high-tech devices; and\n\u2022 Energizer EcoAdvanced, the world's first high performance AA battery made with 4% recycled batteries.\nToday, Energizer offers batteries using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In addition, Energizer has an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a breadth of consumer needs. We distribute, market, and/or license lighting products including headlights, lanterns, kid's lights and area lights. In addition to the Energizer and Eveready brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case, Dolphin, and WeatherReady sub-brands.\nOn July 1, 2016, Energizer expanded its portfolio of brands with the acquisition of a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. Energizer's portfolio of innovative products now includes automotive fragrance and appearance products marketed under the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL, and Eagle One brands.\nThrough our global supply chain, global manufacturing footprint and seasoned commercial organization, we seek to meet diverse customer demands within each of the markets we serve. Energizer distributes its portfolio of batteries and lighting products through a global sales force and global distributor model. We sell our products in multiple retail and business-to-business channels, including: mass merchandisers, club, electronics, food, home improvement, dollar store, auto, drug, hardware, convenience, sporting goods, hobby/craft, e-commerce, office, industrial, medical and catalog.\nIn recent years, we have also focused on reducing our costs and improving our cash flow from operations. Our restructuring efforts and working capital initiative have resulted in substantial cost reductions and improved cash flows. These initiatives, coupled with our strong product margins over recent years, have significantly contributed to our results of operations and working capital position.\nWe use the Energizer name and logo as our trademark as well as those of our subsidiaries. Product names appearing throughout are trademarks of Energizer. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.\nEnergizer manages its business in four geographic reportable segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d), and Asia Pacific. Our four geographic segments have distinct characteristics that help Energizer deliver its strategic objectives.\nNorth America. The North America segment, including the United States and Canada, accounts for approximately 54% of global sales and 64% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales in the U.S. represent a significant majority of sales in the North America segment.\nLatin America. The Latin America segment, including Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America, accounts for approximately 7% of global sales and 5% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales are distributed across the modern and traditional classes of trade. While carbon zinc battery sales continue to represent a sizable portion of the overall market volume, consumption of higher priced alkaline batteries continues to grow. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength allows us to compete effectively by focusing on alkaline and carbon zinc product solutions under a premium brand and a price brand.\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 as a result of deconsolidating their Venezuelan subsidiaries, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Energizer was allocated $65.2 of this one-time charge. The Venezuela deconsolidation charge was reported on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Venezuela net sales and segment profit recognized prior to the deconsolidation, through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, are $8.5 and $2.5, respectively. Included within Energizer's fiscal year 2014 results for Venezuela are net sales of $25.8 and segment profit of $13.1. See Financial Results\u201d for further discussion.\nEMEA. The EMEA segment accounts for approximately 22% of global sales and 13% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Premium and performance alkaline, as well as rechargeable battery penetration is high across many European markets, while carbon zinc represents the majority of the category volume in our Middle East and Africa markets. The Energizer and Eveready brands allow us to compete effectively across this diverse set of markets offering consumers and retailers a portfolio of products under a premium brand and a price brand. The demand for private label batteries remains high in certain European markets, primarily Germany, France and Spain.\nAsia Pacific. The Asia Pacific segment accounts for approximately 17% of global sales and 18% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength provides critical mass and category leadership in certain Asia Pacific markets as we are able to offer retailers and consumers a full portfolio of products both under a premium brand and a price brand. The competitive environment in certain markets has been elevated throughout the current fiscal year due to increased private label activity driven by certain discount retailers.\nFinancial Results\nNet earnings for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $127.7, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $4.0, or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share, and net earnings of $157.3, or $2.53 per diluted share, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEarnings/(loss) before income taxes, net earnings/(loss) and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) for the time periods presented were impacted by certain items related to the Spin-off transaction, cost of early debt retirement, restructuring and realignment costs, acquisition and integration costs, acquisition inventory step up costs, Venezuela deconsolidation and adjustments to prior year tax accruals as described in the tables below. The impact of these items on reported earnings/(loss) before income taxes, reported net earnings/(loss) and reported EPS are provided below as a reconciliation to arrive at respective non-GAAP measures. See disclosure under Non-GAAP Financial Measures above.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For The Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Earnings/(Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted EPS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported -

The increase was driven by the impact of the auto care acquisition on July 1, 2016 which added $32.3, or 2.0%, as well as the increase in organic sales of $60.4, or 3.7%. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency of $66.9, or 4.1%, $8.5, or 0.5%, due to the change in Venezuela results as a result of the deconsolidation and $14.7, or 0.9%, related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors).

The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $60.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 was 43.6% compared to 46.3% in the prior year. Excluding the impact from the one-time accounting adjustment ($8.1) related to the fair market value step up of the auto care acquisition inventory and spin and integration charges ($2.8 in fiscal 2016 and $3.9 in fiscal 2015), gross margin percentage was 44.3% or 230 basis points below prior year. This change was driven by a 180 basis point impact due to an unfavorable movement in currencies, increased costs related to planned as well as accelerated discrete productivity initiatives and increased costs in support of product innovation.\nGross profit dollars were $756.2 in fiscal 2015 versus $850.4 in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the decline in net sales mentioned earlier and unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $99.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2015 was 46.3% which was flat against the prior year. Excluding the impacts of currencies of approximately $99, change in Venezuela results of $13.5 and international go-to-market changes of\napproximately $4, the gross margin rate increased 330 basis points from continued cost reductions and modest commodity cost favorability.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSG&A expenses were $352.6 in fiscal 2016, or 21.6% of net sales as compared to $426.3, or 26.1% of net sales for fiscal 2015 and $391.3, or 21.3% of net sales for fiscal 2014. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2016 was separation charges of $10.0 related to the execution of the Spin-off transaction as well as $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs related to the auto care acquisition. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2015 was approximately $107 of special charges. Separation charges of $97.6 were included in this amount and primarily related to the execution of the spin-off transaction. Also included were approximately $9 related to integration, restructuring initiatives and transitional expenses related to the separation. Similarly, fiscal year 2014 included $5.9 of charges directly associated with our restructuring initiatives that were recorded within SG&A. In addition, fiscal 2014 also included $21.3 of pretax separation related charges. Excluding the impacts of these items, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 20.4% in fiscal 2016 as compared to 20.0% in fiscal 2015 and 19.8% in fiscal 2014.\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion\nA&P was $102.4, down $29.9 as compared to fiscal 2015. A&P as a percent of net sales was 6.3% for fiscal 2016 and was 8.1% and 6.6% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower level of A&P spending as a percent of net sales in fiscal years 2016 versus 2015 was due to higher prior year spending related to the EcoAdvanced product launch. The higher level of A&P spending as a percentage of net sales in fiscal years 2015 versus 2014 was due to increased support behind our brands and the launch of EcoAdvanced, which occurred in the second fiscal quarter of 2015. A&P expense may vary from year to year due to new product launches, strategic brand support initiatives, the overall competitive environment, as well as the type of A&P spending.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expense was $26.6 in fiscal 2016, $24.9 in fiscal 2015 and $25.3 in fiscal 2014. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was 1.6% in fiscal 2016, 1.5% in fiscal 2015 and 1.4% in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal year 2016 was due to the auto care acquisition and planned spending in support of product innovation. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to cost reductions as a result of our 2013 restructuring project.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $54.3, a decrease of $23.6 as compared to fiscal 2015. The current period expense is related to the outstanding term loan and senior note at September 30, 2016, $1.2 of expense from the bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition, increased debt outstanding on the credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the impact of the interest rate swap during the year. Included within fiscal 2015 interest expense were debt breakage fees of $26.7, which were allocated to Energizer in the third fiscal quarter as a result of the April notice of prepayment to the holders of Edgewell's outstanding notes. Excluding the debt breakage fees, interest was $51.2, down $1.5 in comparison to fiscal 2014. This was due primarily to lower interest costs resulting from lower average interest rates on debt outstanding. Interest expense for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 and all of fiscal 2014 was based on an allocation from Edgewell.\nOther Financing Income, Net\nOther financing, net was income of $0.3 in fiscal 2016 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income which were almost fully offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures and an impairment charge on an available for sale security of $2.0. Other financing, net was income of $18.4 in fiscal 2015 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains, interest income and net revaluation gains on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures. In fiscal 2014, Other financing, net was expense of $0.7 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.\nIncome Taxes\nFor fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate was 22.9%, which was favorably impacted by certain return to provision adjustments related to prior year provision estimates and certain spin related adjustments of $11.4. In addition, the rate was favorably impacted by costs related to integration, separation and restructuring charges as a majority of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 29.8%.\nFor fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate was 455.1%. This rate was largely impacted by the Venezuela deconsolidation charge of $65.2, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Partially offsetting this expense were pre-tax losses in high tax rate jurisdictions driven by spin costs of $137.2, interest payments as a result of the early debt retirement of $26.7 and restructuring charges of $13.0. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 27.0%.\nFor fiscal 2014, the effective tax rate was 26.9%, which was favorably impacted by costs related to the separation and the 2013 restructuring project. Both of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of these items, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was 27.5%. This rate was more favorable versus the prior year due to the mix of countries from which earnings were derived as foreign earnings increased in lower tax rate countries, most significantly Singapore.\nEnergizer's effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates.\nVenezuela Deconsolidation Charge\nVenezuelan exchange control regulations have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and have restricted our Venezuelan operations' ability to pay dividends and settle intercompany obligations. The severe currency controls imposed by the Venezuelan government have significantly limited Energizer's ability to realize the benefits from earnings of Energizer's Venezuelan operations and access the resulting liquidity provided by those earnings. Energizer expects that this condition will continue for the foreseeable future. This lack of exchangeability has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries for accounting purposes. We deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results will not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. Instead, we will record revenue for sales of inventory to our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements to the extent cash is received. Further, dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as other income upon receipt of the cash. Included within the results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, for Venezuela are net sales of $8.5 and segment profit of $2.5. See further discussion in \"Segment Results\" below.\nAs a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries at March 31, 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 in the second quarter of 2015, of which $65.2 was allocated to Energizer based on the Venezuelan operations being distributed as part of Energizer. This charge included:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>foreign currency translation losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which $16.2 was allocated to Energizer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' cash balance, of which $44.6 was allocated to Energizer, (at the 6.30 per U.S. dollar rate)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' other net assets, of which $4.4 was allocated to Energizer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpin Costs\nThe Company incurred costs associated with the evaluation, planning and execution of the spin transaction.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $16.2 in spin costs including $10.0 recorded in SG&A, $0.4 recorded in cost of products sold and $5.8 recorded in spin restructuring. Included in spin restructuring were contract termination costs related to the exit of a corporate office building as we right-sized our headquarters' footprint. The contract termination costs were $3.7 based on the estimated fair value of the future cash flows associated with this operating lease.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded spin costs of $163.9, of which $97.6 was recorded in SG&A, $0.5 was recorded in cost of products sold, $39.1 was recorded in spin restructuring and $26.7 of cost of early debt retirement was recorded in interest expense. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded spin costs of $21.3 all of which was recorded in SG&A.\nOn a project to date basis, the total costs incurred and allocated to Energizer for the spin-off were $201.4, inclusive of the costs of early debt retirement recorded in fiscal 2015. Energizer expects remaining spin costs, if any, to be immaterial.\n2013 Restructuring\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Energizer recorded $2.5 in pre-tax restructuring charges related to the 2013 restructuring project as compared to $9.6 and $43.5 in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restructuring charges were reflected on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. In addition, pre-tax costs of $3.1 and $1.0 associated with certain inventory obsolescence charges were recorded within Cost of products sold and $0.3 and $5.9 associated with information technology enablement activities were recorded within SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These inventory obsolescence and information technology costs are considered part of the total project costs incurred for the 2013 restructuring project.\nThe 2013 Restructuring Project is complete and the full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings exceeded $218. The primary impacts of savings were reflected in improved gross margin and lower overhead expenses. Savings related to the 2013 restructuring project were fully realized as of June 30, 2015.\nSegment Results\nOperations for Energizer are managed via four geographic segments - North America (U.S. and Canada), Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with most restructuring initiatives, business realignment activities, R&D, amortization of intangible assets and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of substantially all restructuring and realignment costs from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.\nEnergizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis. This structure is the basis for Energizer's reportable operating segment information, as included in the tables in Note 20, Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales -

For fiscal 2015, general corporate expenses were $66.0, an increase of $3.5 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to transitional costs incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter. For fiscal 2014, general corporate expenses were $62.5.\nGlobal marketing expenses were $19.1 in fiscal 2016, $24.8 in fiscal 2015, and $20.7 in fiscal 2014. The current year expense represents savings and efficiencies realized from managing global marketing activities using a center led approach to support our brands. The prior year periods were based on an allocation from Edgewell using a carve-out methodology. Fiscal 2015 was slightly higher due to increased support of the EcoAdvanced launch.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEnergizer's primary future cash needs will be centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation, Energizer may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit Energizer's access to capital markets, or making acquisitions using its equity as currency, potentially requiring Energizer to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d for a further discussion.\nCash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2016, Energizer had $287.3 of cash and cash equivalents, 96.2% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.\nOn June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five-year $250.0 senior secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Facility) and a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility (Term Loan) that became effective on June 30, 2015. Also on June 1, 2015, Energizer completed the issuance and sale of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (Senior Notes), with proceeds placed in escrow and released June 30, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company financed the auto care acquisition with a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility. On July 8, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing credit agreement to increase capacity on the Revolving Facility to $350.0. This additional capacity is available to be utilized for working capital and other general corporate purposes. There were no other changes to the terms of the Revolving Facility. In the month of July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin based on total Company leverage. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $52.5 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and had $6.7 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $290.8 remains available as of September 30, 2016.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreements governing the Company's debt agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these credit agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was, and expects to remain, in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements.\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016, $161.8 in fiscal 2015, and $219.9 in fiscal 2014.\nCash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016 as compared to $161.8 in the prior fiscal year. The increase of $32.1 was the result of higher net earnings in fiscal 2016, higher accounts payable due to the timing of payments and the benefit of lower inventory levels driven by increased sales volume and the benefits of initiatives that reduced days in inventory. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accruals, primarily related to the payment of spin related costs and accrued A&P expenses.\nThe decrease in cash flow of $58.1 from operating activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by lower net earnings resulting from the negative impact of currencies and cash expenditures related to the separation, most notably spent in the third fiscal quarter. The cash expenditures related to the separation were partially offset by improvements in working capital of $64.2 versus fiscal 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $371.2, $38.8, and $22.8 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The primary driver of the change in net cash used by investing activities versus the prior years was due to the cash utilized for the auto care acquisition in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures were $28.7, $40.4, and $28.4 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to IT spending associated with the separation occurring in 2015. These capital expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations. See Note 20, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment.\nInvesting cash outflows of approximately $30 to $35 are anticipated in fiscal 2017 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments. Total capital expenditures are expected to be financed with funds generated from operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities was $45.4 in 2016, net cash from financing was $309.2 in fiscal year 2015 and net cash used by financing activities was $185.5 in fiscal years 2014. For fiscal 2016, cash flow used by financing activities consists of the following:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase on debt with maturities of 90 days or less of $58.9 representing the increase in notes payable and our Revolving Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividends paid of $62.7 during the fiscal 2016 (see below);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt issuance costs of $1.6 primarily representing the fees paid as part of the July 1, 2016 bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Purchase of treasury stock representing the cash paid for stock repurchases under the current authorization during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 (see below); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net taxes paid of $5.2 representing the liquidation of RSEAs upon vesting.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor fiscal 2015, cash flow from financing activities consists of the following:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net cash proceeds of $999.0 resulted from the June 1, 2015 debt issuance consisting of a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility and the June 30, 2015 issuance of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Debt issuance costs of $12.1 representing the fees paid and capitalized as part of the June 1, 2015 debt issuance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the first quarter principal payment on the Term Loan;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Payments on debt with maturities of 90 days or less representing the pay down of notes payable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividends paid of $15.5 during fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015 (see below); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net transfers to Parent and affiliates represents the cash flow impact of Energizer's net dividend to Edgewell.

The unpaid dividends were associated with unvested restricted shares and were recorded in other liabilities.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 14, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.275 per share of common stock, payable on December 15, 2016, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2016.\nShare Repurchases\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 832,971 shares for $32.6, at an average price of $39.06 per share, under this authorization. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a current liability of $0.8 for a portion of these repurchases with the cash payment occurring in the first three days of fiscal 2017. No share repurchases were made during fiscal year 2015. Future share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of Energizer's contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 is shown below:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>996.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>976.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations and other (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,516.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The above table is based upon the debt balance and LIBOR rate as of September 30, 2016.

These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party\u201d (PRP) and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund\u201d sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.\nAccrued environmental costs at September 30, 2016 were $4.7, of which approximately $1 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2017. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses continue to increase, although due to optimization efforts, the expenditures are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, combined earnings or competitive position at this time. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management's estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to allocations from Edgewell for pre-spin periods, accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, share-based compensation, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer's significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer's accounting policies.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Energizer and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Energizer has no material equity method investments or variable interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to the spin-off on July 1, 2015, our financial statements were prepared on a combined standalone basis derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Edgewell and reflect the historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Energizer in accordance with GAAP. Account allocations of shared functions to Energizer were based on the allocations to the Household Products segment within Edgewell's financial statements. Shared functions between Edgewell's Household Products and Personal Care segments and Edgewell itself include product warehousing and distribution, various transaction processing functions, and in some countries, a combined sales force and management. Edgewell has historically applied a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations by Edgewell are estimates, and do not fully represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.\nThe Financial Statements are presented as if Energizer had been carved out of Edgewell for all periods prior to the spin-off. All significant transactions within Energizer were eliminated. The assets and liabilities in the carve-out financial statements were reflected on a historical cost basis, as immediately prior to the distribution all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Edgewell and were transferred to Energizer at carry-over basis.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate Expense Allocations - These Consolidated Financial Statements include expense allocations for the periods prior to the spin-off including (1) certain product warehousing and distribution; (2) various transaction process functions; (3) a consolidated sales force and management for certain countries; (4) certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Edgewell and not recorded at the business division level, including, but not limited to, finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, facilities, and compliance; (5) employee benefits and compensation; (6) share-based compensation; (7) financing costs; (8) the effects of restructurings and the Venezuela deconsolidation; and (9) cost of early debt retirement. These expenses were allocated to Energizer on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a basis of global net sales, cost of sales, operating income, headcount or other measures of Energizer and Edgewell. Certain debt obligations of Edgewell have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Energizer prior to the spin-off, because Energizer was not a party to the obligation between Edgewell and the debt holders. Financing costs related to such debt obligations have been allocated to Energizer based on the extent to which Energizer participated in Edgewell's corporate financing activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes the assumptions regarding allocated expenses, reasonably reflect the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by Energizer during the periods prior to the spin-off. Nevertheless, the allocations may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by Energizer and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been an independent standalone company. It is not practicable to estimate actual costs that would have been incurred had Energizer been a standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Energizer had been a standalone company would depend on\nmultiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenue Recognition - Energizer's revenue is from the sale of its products. Revenue is recognized when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discounts is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms are final and returns or exchanges are not permitted unless a special exception is made. Reserves are established and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnergizer offers a variety of programs, such as consumer coupons and similar consumer rebate programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Promotions which reduce the ultimate consumer sale prices are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time the promotional offer is made, generally using estimated redemption and participation levels. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pension Plans - The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for pension benefits are dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds that coincide with the cash flows of its plans' estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which represent the Company's most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer yield curve in determining the discount rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company's annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2016, a one percentage point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company's pre-tax pension expense by $4.6. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension obligations by $57.7 at September 30, 2016.\nAs allowed under GAAP, the Company's U.S. qualified pension plan uses Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years so it reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Share-Based Payments - The Company grants restricted stock equivalents, which generally vest over two to four years. Stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the full restriction period of the award.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHowever, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nThe recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are likely more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we tested goodwill for impairment. There were no indications of impairment of goodwill noted during this testing. In addition, we completed impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in our various product categories. No impairment was indicated as a result of this testing.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income Taxes - Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe regularly repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, these non-U.S. subsidiaries are in tax jurisdictions with effective tax rates that do not result in materially higher U.S. tax provisions related to the repatriated earnings. No provision is made for additional taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates that are intended and planned to be indefinitely invested in foreign affiliates. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 8, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet and results in each tax paying jurisdiction having either a noncurrent deferred tax asset or a noncurrent deferred tax liability. The netting of different jurisdictions' noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities is still prohibited.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company had a long term deferred tax asset balance of $63.7 and a long term deferred tax liability balance of $16.1. The Company applied this guidance retrospectively and the reclassification resulted in a long term deferred tax asset balance as of September 30, 2015 of $163.1, an increase of $49.3 to the previously reported balance. Additionally, the long term deferred tax liability increased $1.2, resulting in a balance of $8.8, as of September 30, 2015. The current portion of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability had previously been reported in Other current assets and Other current liabilities, respectively.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and FASB ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. These ASUs require most debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability rather than as an asset; however debt issuance costs relating to revolving credit facilities will remain in other assets. We adopted this standard for the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively to September 30, 2015. See Note 14, Debt. The balance for unamortized debt issuance costs that was reclassified to Debt and from Other assets was $10.7 at September 30, 2015.\nDuring the fiscal 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This guidance requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts recognized as part of a business combination in the period the adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. There was no impact on the financial statements upon adoption.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU requires tax expense to be recognized from the sale of intra-entity assets, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs, even though the effects of the transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Under the current guidance, the tax effects of transfers would have been deferred until the transferred asset was sold or otherwise recovered through use. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first interim period of a fiscal year. Upon adoption, any deferred charge established upon the intra-company transfer would be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred charge of $51.2. The Company expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. This update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact the revised guidance will have on our current classification on the Statement of Cash Flow.\nOn March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation. This new ASU simplifies the accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company currently expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU aligns the measurement of leases under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn July 22, 2015, the FASB issued a new ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), which aligns the measurement of inventory under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards. Under the new guidance, an entity that measures inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). This ASU removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair values are measured using the net asset value per share (NAV) in the fair value hierarchy. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. As a result of this ASU, Energizer's pension plan assets that are valued using their NAV will no longer be disclosed in the fair value hierarchy disclosures of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nOn April 15, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and other - internal-use software (Subtopic 350-40), which provides criteria to review cloud computing arrangements to determine whether the arrangement contains a software license or is solely a service contract. If the arrangement is determined to be a software license, fees paid to the vendor would be within the scope of internal-use software guidance. If not, the fees paid would be expensed as incurred. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. The Company's current accounting for cloud computing arrangements is consistent with this guidance.\nOn August 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-17, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The Company's first reporting date with the new standard will be December 31, 2016. We will evaluate the effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as applicable.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-09, Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries and across capital markets. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of the ASU. The update will now be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou should read the following MD&A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see above Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nAll amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains both historical and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of Energizer. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"expectation,\" \"anticipate,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"belief,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"forecast,\" \"outlook,\" or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:\n \u2022 market and economic conditions; \n \u2022 market trends in the categories in which we compete; \n \u2022 the success of new products and the ability to continually develop and market new products; \n \u2022 our ability to attract, retain and improve distribution with key customers; \n \u2022 our ability to continue planned advertising and other promotional spending; \n \u2022 our ability to timely execute strategic initiatives, including restructurings, and international go-to-market changes in a manner that will positively impact our financial condition and results of operations and does not disrupt our business operations; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic initiatives, including restructurings, on our relationships with employees, customers and vendors; \n \u2022 our ability to maintain and improve market share in the categories in which we operate despite heightened competitive pressure; \n \u2022 our ability to improve operations and realize cost savings; \n \u2022 the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls, as well as offsetting hedges, including the impact of the United Kingdom's referendum vote and announced intention to exit the European Union at some future date; \n \u2022 the impact of raw materials and other commodity costs; \n \u2022 costs and reputational damage associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches; \n \u2022 our ability to acquire and integrate businesses, and to realize the projected results of acquisitions, including our ability to integrate the auto care acquisition successfully and to achieve the anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other anticipated benefits; \n \u2022 the impact of advertising and product liability claims and other litigation; \n \u2022 compliance with debt covenants and maintenance of credit ratings as well as the impact of interest and principal repayment of our existing and any future debt; and \n \u2022 the impact of legislative or regulatory determinations or changes by federal, state and local, and foreign authorities, including taxing authorities. \nIn addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial could affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. The list of factors above is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Additional risks and uncertainties include those described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Report, as updated from time to time in the Company's public filings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period and assist investors in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our four geographic segments including allocations for shared IT and finance functions. General corporate and other expenses, Global marketing expenses, Research and development (R&D) expenses, Amortization of intangible assets, interest expense and charges related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructuring, the acquisition fair value inventory step up (inventory step up), acquisition and integration have all been excluded from segment profit.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Taxes, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS. These measures exclude the impact of the costs related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructurings, acquisition and integration, cost of early debt retirement, inventory step up and adjustments to prior year tax accruals.\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue, segment profit or other margins that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of our go-to-market initiatives, the change in our Venezuela results from the deconsolidation of those operations, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\nInternational Go-to-market initiatives. To compete more effectively as an independent company, we increased our use of exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers, and decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries, consistent with our international go-to-market strategy. In order to capture the impact of these international go-to-market changes and exits, we have separately identified the impact of these changes, which represents the year over year change in those markets since the date of exit. The impact from these changes was fully realized during the third quarter 2016.\nChange in Venezuela Results. As previously announced, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results do not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. As a result of the deconsolidation, we have taken the year over year change in Venezuela results and separately identified the impact in our change in sales and segment profit.\nImpact of acquisition. On July 1, 2016, Energizer completed its auto care acquisition. This includes the impact the auto care acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs or the one time inventory fair value step up costs associated with the auto care acquisition.\nImpact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to spin-off, restructuring, inventory step up, and acquisition and integration.\nAcquisition\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products, for a total purchase price of $340.0 plus working capital adjustments of $4.0, net of acquired cash. The Company financed the acquisition with $300.0 of cash on hand and $44.0 of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility (Revolving Facility). The Company initially utilized a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility to complete the transaction. Later in July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand. The Company incurred an additional $1.2 of interest expense in July related to this outstanding bridge loan. The Company did not incur incremental U.S. taxes from utilizing foreign cash for this transaction.\nWith the auto care acquisition, Energizer's brands now include Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL and Eagle One. The acquisition will allow the Company to expand its portfolio, increase presence at existing customers, and utilize its scale and global supply chain to drive efficiencies.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs, $1.2 of interest expense associated with the bridge loan and $8.1 of additional costs of products sold related to the inventory fair market value step up on the acquisition date. Total acquisition and integration related costs associated with the auto care acquisition are expected to be in the range of $25 to $30. We expect to incur the remaining costs during fiscal year 2017.\nThe Separation\nOn July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from Edgewell via a tax free spin-off. To effect the separation, Edgewell, undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities. As a result of these transactions, Energizer now holds the Household Products' product group and Edgewell holds the Personal Care product group. As a result of the Spin-off, Energizer now operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol \"ENR.\"\nIn conjunction with the Spin-off, Edgewell distributed 62,193,281 shares of Energizer common stock to its shareholders. Under the terms of the Spin-off, Edgewell common stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 16, 2015, the record date for the distribution, received one share in Energizer for each share of Edgewell common stock they held. Edgewell completed the distribution of Energizer common stock to its shareholders on July 1, 2015, the distribution date. The transaction was structured to be tax-free to its U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEnergizer's first three fiscal quarters of 2015 as well as all of 2014 are based on carve out financial data. Net sales, Gross profit, Advertising & promotion (A&P) and R&D spending are directly attributable to our business. However, certain SG&A, Interest expense, including the cost of early debt retirement, and Spin-off and Restructuring related charges are allocated from Edgewell and not necessarily representative of Energizer's stand-alone results or expected future results of Energizer as an independent company.\nOverview\nGeneral\nEnergizer, through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the world's largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products.

These initiatives, coupled with our strong product margins over recent years, have significantly contributed to our results of operations and working capital position.\nWe use the Energizer name and logo as our trademark as well as those of our subsidiaries. Product names appearing throughout are trademarks of Energizer. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.\nEnergizer manages its business in four geographic reportable segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d), and Asia Pacific. Our four geographic segments have distinct characteristics that help Energizer deliver its strategic objectives.\nNorth America. The North America segment, including the United States and Canada, accounts for approximately 54% of global sales and 64% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales in the U.S. represent a significant majority of sales in the North America segment.\nLatin America. The Latin America segment, including Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America, accounts for approximately 7% of global sales and 5% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales are distributed across the modern and traditional classes of trade. While carbon zinc battery sales continue to represent a sizable portion of the overall market volume, consumption of higher priced alkaline batteries continues to grow. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength allows us to compete effectively by focusing on alkaline and carbon zinc product solutions under a premium brand and a price brand.\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 as a result of deconsolidating their Venezuelan subsidiaries, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Energizer was allocated $65.2 of this one-time charge. The Venezuela deconsolidation charge was reported on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Venezuela net sales and segment profit recognized prior to the deconsolidation, through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, are $8.5 and $2.5, respectively. Included within Energizer's fiscal year 2014 results for Venezuela are net sales of $25.8 and segment profit of $13.1. See Financial Results\u201d for further discussion.\nEMEA. The EMEA segment accounts for approximately 22% of global sales and 13% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Premium and performance alkaline, as well as rechargeable battery penetration is high across many European markets, while carbon zinc represents the majority of the category volume in our Middle East and Africa markets. The Energizer and Eveready brands allow us to compete effectively across this diverse set of markets offering consumers and retailers a portfolio of products under a premium brand and a price brand. The demand for private label batteries remains high in certain European markets, primarily Germany, France and Spain.\nAsia Pacific. The Asia Pacific segment accounts for approximately 17% of global sales and 18% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength provides critical mass and category leadership in certain Asia Pacific markets as we are able to offer retailers and consumers a full portfolio of products both under a premium brand and a price brand. The competitive environment in certain markets has been elevated throughout the current fiscal year due to increased private label activity driven by certain discount retailers.\nFinancial Results\nNet earnings for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $127.7, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $4.0, or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share, and net earnings of $157.3, or $2.53 per diluted share, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEarnings/(loss) before income taxes, net earnings/(loss) and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) for the time periods presented were impacted by certain items related to the Spin-off transaction, cost of early debt retirement, restructuring and realignment costs, acquisition and integration costs, acquisition inventory step up costs, Venezuela deconsolidation and adjustments to prior year tax accruals as described in the tables below. The impact of these items on reported earnings/(loss) before income taxes, reported net earnings/(loss) and reported EPS are provided below as a reconciliation to arrive at respective non-GAAP measures.

The increase was driven by the impact of the auto care acquisition on July 1, 2016 which added $32.3, or 2.0%, as well as the increase in organic sales of $60.4, or 3.7%. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency of $66.9, or 4.1%, $8.5, or 0.5%, due to the change in Venezuela results as a result of the deconsolidation and $14.7, or 0.9%, related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Organic net sales increased 3.7% primarily due to:\n \u2022 Net distribution and space gain which accounted for 2.3% of the total organic increase; \n \u2022 Pricing actions and the timing of holiday shipments; \n \u2022 Partially offset by heightened competitive activity in certain Asia developed markets. \nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 decreased 11.3%, inclusive of a $109.7, or 5.9%, due to the unfavorable impact of currency movements, $17.3, or 0.9%, due to change in Venezuela results as a result of the deconsolidation and $16.4, or 0.9%, related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of these unfavorable items, organic sales decreased $65.4, or 3.6%, primarily due to:\n \u2022 The timing of holiday shipments and temporary prior year shelf gains that were not repeated in the current fiscal year which account for 4.7% of the total organic net sales decline; \n \u2022 Partially offset by space and distribution gains, primarily in Western Europe, which accounted for 1.1%. \nFor further discussion regarding net sales in each of our geographic segments, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, please see the section titled Segment Results\u201d provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit dollars were $712.4 in fiscal 2016 versus $756.2 in fiscal 2015. The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $60.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 was 43.6% compared to 46.3% in the prior year. Excluding the impact from the one-time accounting adjustment ($8.1) related to the fair market value step up of the auto care acquisition inventory and spin and integration charges ($2.8 in fiscal 2016 and $3.9 in fiscal 2015), gross margin percentage was 44.3% or 230 basis points below prior year. This change was driven by a 180 basis point impact due to an unfavorable movement in currencies, increased costs related to planned as well as accelerated discrete productivity initiatives and increased costs in support of product innovation.\nGross profit dollars were $756.2 in fiscal 2015 versus $850.4 in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the decline in net sales mentioned earlier and unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $99.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2015 was 46.3% which was flat against the prior year. Excluding the impacts of currencies of approximately $99, change in Venezuela results of $13.5 and international go-to-market changes of\napproximately $4, the gross margin rate increased 330 basis points from continued cost reductions and modest commodity cost favorability.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSG&A expenses were $352.6 in fiscal 2016, or 21.6% of net sales as compared to $426.3, or 26.1% of net sales for fiscal 2015 and $391.3, or 21.3% of net sales for fiscal 2014. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2016 was separation charges of $10.0 related to the execution of the Spin-off transaction as well as $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs related to the auto care acquisition. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2015 was approximately $107 of special charges. Separation charges of $97.6 were included in this amount and primarily related to the execution of the spin-off transaction. Also included were approximately $9 related to integration, restructuring initiatives and transitional expenses related to the separation. Similarly, fiscal year 2014 included $5.9 of charges directly associated with our restructuring initiatives that were recorded within SG&A. In addition, fiscal 2014 also included $21.3 of pretax separation related charges. Excluding the impacts of these items, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 20.4% in fiscal 2016 as compared to 20.0% in fiscal 2015 and 19.8% in fiscal 2014.\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion\nA&P was $102.4, down $29.9 as compared to fiscal 2015. A&P as a percent of net sales was 6.3% for fiscal 2016 and was 8.1% and 6.6% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower level of A&P spending as a percent of net sales in fiscal years 2016 versus 2015 was due to higher prior year spending related to the EcoAdvanced product launch. The higher level of A&P spending as a percentage of net sales in fiscal years 2015 versus 2014 was due to increased support behind our brands and the launch of EcoAdvanced, which occurred in the second fiscal quarter of 2015. A&P expense may vary from year to year due to new product launches, strategic brand support initiatives, the overall competitive environment, as well as the type of A&P spending.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expense was $26.6 in fiscal 2016, $24.9 in fiscal 2015 and $25.3 in fiscal 2014. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was 1.6% in fiscal 2016, 1.5% in fiscal 2015 and 1.4% in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal year 2016 was due to the auto care acquisition and planned spending in support of product innovation. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to cost reductions as a result of our 2013 restructuring project.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $54.3, a decrease of $23.6 as compared to fiscal 2015. The current period expense is related to the outstanding term loan and senior note at September 30, 2016, $1.2 of expense from the bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition, increased debt outstanding on the credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the impact of the interest rate swap during the year. Included within fiscal 2015 interest expense were debt breakage fees of $26.7, which were allocated to Energizer in the third fiscal quarter as a result of the April notice of prepayment to the holders of Edgewell's outstanding notes. Excluding the debt breakage fees, interest was $51.2, down $1.5 in comparison to fiscal 2014. This was due primarily to lower interest costs resulting from lower average interest rates on debt outstanding. Interest expense for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 and all of fiscal 2014 was based on an allocation from Edgewell.\nOther Financing Income, Net\nOther financing, net was income of $0.3 in fiscal 2016 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income which were almost fully offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures and an impairment charge on an available for sale security of $2.0. Other financing, net was income of $18.4 in fiscal 2015 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains, interest income and net revaluation gains on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures. In fiscal 2014, Other financing, net was expense of $0.7 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.\nIncome Taxes\nFor fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate was 22.9%, which was favorably impacted by certain return to provision adjustments related to prior year provision estimates and certain spin related adjustments of $11.4. In addition, the rate was favorably impacted by costs related to integration, separation and restructuring charges as a majority of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 29.8%.\nFor fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate was 455.1%. This rate was largely impacted by the Venezuela deconsolidation charge of $65.2, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Partially offsetting this expense were pre-tax losses in high tax rate jurisdictions driven by spin costs of $137.2, interest payments as a result of the early debt retirement of $26.7 and restructuring charges of $13.0. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 27.0%.\nFor fiscal 2014, the effective tax rate was 26.9%, which was favorably impacted by costs related to the separation and the 2013 restructuring project. Both of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of these items, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was 27.5%. This rate was more favorable versus the prior year due to the mix of countries from which earnings were derived as foreign earnings increased in lower tax rate countries, most significantly Singapore.\nEnergizer's effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates.\nVenezuela Deconsolidation Charge\nVenezuelan exchange control regulations have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and have restricted our Venezuelan operations' ability to pay dividends and settle intercompany obligations. The severe currency controls imposed by the Venezuelan government have significantly limited Energizer's ability to realize the benefits from earnings of Energizer's Venezuelan operations and access the resulting liquidity provided by those earnings. Energizer expects that this condition will continue for the foreseeable future. This lack of exchangeability has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries for accounting purposes. We deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results will not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. Instead, we will record revenue for sales of inventory to our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements to the extent cash is received. Further, dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as other income upon receipt of the cash. Included within the results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, for Venezuela are net sales of $8.5 and segment profit of $2.5. See further discussion in \"Segment Results\" below.\nAs a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries at March 31, 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 in the second quarter of 2015, of which $65.2 was allocated to Energizer based on the Venezuelan operations being distributed as part of Energizer. This charge included:\n \u2022 foreign currency translation losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which $16.2 was allocated to Energizer \n \u2022 the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' cash balance, of which $44.6 was allocated to Energizer, (at the 6.30 per U.S. dollar rate) \n \u2022 the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' other net assets, of which $4.4 was allocated to Energizer \nSpin Costs\nThe Company incurred costs associated with the evaluation, planning and execution of the spin transaction.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $16.2 in spin costs including $10.0 recorded in SG&A, $0.4 recorded in cost of products sold and $5.8 recorded in spin restructuring. Included in spin restructuring were contract termination costs related to the exit of a corporate office building as we right-sized our headquarters' footprint. The contract termination costs were $3.7 based on the estimated fair value of the future cash flows associated with this operating lease.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded spin costs of $163.9, of which $97.6 was recorded in SG&A, $0.5 was recorded in cost of products sold, $39.1 was recorded in spin restructuring and $26.7 of cost of early debt retirement was recorded in interest expense. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded spin costs of $21.3 all of which was recorded in SG&A.\nOn a project to date basis, the total costs incurred and allocated to Energizer for the spin-off were $201.4, inclusive of the costs of early debt retirement recorded in fiscal 2015. Energizer expects remaining spin costs, if any, to be immaterial.\n2013 Restructuring\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Energizer recorded $2.5 in pre-tax restructuring charges related to the 2013 restructuring project as compared to $9.6 and $43.5 in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restructuring charges were reflected on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. In addition, pre-tax costs of $3.1 and $1.0 associated with certain inventory obsolescence charges were recorded within Cost of products sold and $0.3 and $5.9 associated with information technology enablement activities were recorded within SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These inventory obsolescence and information technology costs are considered part of the total project costs incurred for the 2013 restructuring project.\nThe 2013 Restructuring Project is complete and the full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings exceeded $218. The primary impacts of savings were reflected in improved gross margin and lower overhead expenses. Savings related to the 2013 restructuring project were fully realized as of June 30, 2015.\nSegment Results\nOperations for Energizer are managed via four geographic segments - North America (U.S. and Canada), Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with most restructuring initiatives, business realignment activities, R&D, amortization of intangible assets and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of substantially all restructuring and realignment costs from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.\nEnergizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis. This structure is the basis for Energizer's reportable operating segment information, as included in the tables in Note 20, Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2016.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales -

These increases were substantially offset by a $66.9 decrease due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $8.5 change in Venezuela results (as a result of deconsolidation) and $14.7 related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America net sales improved 7.2% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 0.6% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The auto care acquisition improved net sales by 3.3%. Excluding the impact of currency movement and the acquisition, organic net sales increased 4.5%. This increase was due to net distribution and space gains and the timing of holiday shipments. \n \u2022 Latin America net sales declined 11.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 17.1% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The deconsolidation of Venezuela accounted for a 6.8% year-over-year decline, the auto care acquisition improved net sales by 1.4%, and the go-to-market impacts had a negative impact of 1.6%. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, Venezuela, the acquisition and the go-to-market changes, organic net sales increased 12.5% driven by positive volume contributions, including the launch of EcoAdvanced in certain markets, distribution gains and pricing actions taken across multiple markets. \n \u2022 EMEA net sales declined 4.5% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 7.4% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The go-to-market impacts associated with market exits and distributors negatively impacted net sales by 0.9%. The auto care acquisition improved net sales by 0.6%. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, go-to-market changes, and the acquisition, organic net sales improved 3.2% driven by positive volume contribution from distribution gains in certain Western and Eastern European markets, pricing actions in certain markets and the continued launch of EcoAdvanced in additional markets. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific net sales declined 8.7% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 4.4% decline due to unfavorable currency movements, a 3.0% decline associated with the go-to-market changes, and a 0.3% increase due to the auto care acquisition. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, go-to-market changes and the acquisition, organic net sales decreased 1.6% driven by continued competitive pressures in certain Asia developed markets slightly offset by distribution gains and positive volume contributions in select markets. \nNet sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 decreased 11.3%, including a decrease of $109.7 due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $17.3 change in Venezuela results (as a result of Edgewell's previously announced deconsolidation and $16.4 related to the initial impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic sales decreased $65.4, or 3.6%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America net sales declined 8.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 0.9% decline due to unfavorable impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales declined 7.7% due primarily to the timing of holiday and promotional shipments and temporary fiscal 2014 shelf gains that were not repeated in fiscal 2015, partially offset by increased shipments related to the EcoAdvanced new product launch during the second fiscal quarter. \n \u2022 Latin America net sales declined 22.8% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 9.7% decline due to unfavorable  currency movements. The deconsolidation of Venezuela accounted for a 10.7% year-over-year decline while the go-to-market impacts had a negative impact of 2.7%. Excluding the impact of currency movements, Venezuela and the go-to-market changes, organic net sales increased 0.3% as pricing gains across several markets were partially offset by volume declines due to the timing of holiday shipments and continued category declines.\n \u2022 EMEA net sales declined 11.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 14.2% decrease due to unfavorable currency movements. The go-to-market impacts associated with market exits and distributors positively contributed to net sales by 0.3% due to pipeline fills associated with distributor changes. Excluding the impact of currency movements go-to-market changes, organic net sales improved 2.3% due to volume increases associated with new distribution, the continued roll out of EcoAdvanced and increased space gains in Western Europe. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific net sales declined 12.9% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 7.5% decline due to unfavorable currency movements and a 3.8% decline associated with the go-to-market changes. Excluding the impact of currency movements and go-to-market changes, organic net sales decreased 1.6% due to phasing of shipments and heightened competitive pressures in two of our major markets, Australia and Korea. \nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Chg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Profit -

These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $9.5, or 2.4%, from the auto care acquisition impact, a $1.7 increase related to the impact of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors), and organic segment profit increase of 8.8%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America segment profit was $247.6, an increase of $13.0, or 5.5%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive \nof the negative $3.6 impact of currency movements and $6.9 increase due to the auto care acquisition. Excluding the impact of currency movements and the acquisition, segment profit increased $9.7, or 4.1%, driven by strong top-line performance, favorable commodity costs and lower A&P spend due to the prior year launch of EcoAdvanced. These items were partially offset by increased costs related to planned as well as accelerated discrete productivity initiatives and increased costs in support of product innovation.\n \u2022 Latin America segment profit was $18.9, a decrease of $1.8, or 8.7%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative $13.8 impact of currency movements. The change in Venezuela (as a result of the deconsolidation) accounted for $2.5, or 12.1%, decrease in segment profit. The go-to-market changes positively contributed $2.5, or 12.1%, to segment profit as the loss of sales was more than offset by a reduction in overhead costs and a $0.9 increase in segment profit is attributable to the auto care acquisition. Excluding these items, organic segment profit increased $11.1, or 53.6%. This increase was driven by an improvement in organic sales driven by positive volume contributions, including the launch of EcoAdvanced in certain markets, distribution gains and pricing actions taken across multiple markets. These increases were partially offset by higher overhead spending due primarily to inflationary increases. \n \u2022 EMEA segment profit was $51.6, a decrease of $6.7, or 11.5%, versus the prior fiscal year. Excluding $19.3 of unfavorable currency impacts, negative impact from go-to-market changes of $1.0 and positive contribution from the auto care acquisition of $1.2, organic segment profit increased $12.4, or 21.3%, due to positive volume contribution from distribution gains in certain Western and Eastern European markets, the continued launch of EcoAdvanced in additional markets and a reduction in A&P and overhead spending. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific segment profit was $70.1, a decrease of $7.8, or 10.0%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements of $9.9, an increase from go-to-market changes of $0.2 and growth due to the auto care acquisition of $0.5. Excluding the impact of these items, segment profit increased $1.4, or 1.8%, driven by distribution gains and positive volume contributions in select markets as well as lower A&P and overhead spending. \nTotal segment profit in fiscal 2015 was $391.5, a decrease of 12.8% versus the prior fiscal year, including a decrease of $66.9, or 14.9%, due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $10.6 decrease due to the change in Venezuela results (due to the previously announced deconsolidation) and a $2.9 increase related to the initial impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of these items, organic segment profit increased 3.9%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America segment profit was $234.6, a decrease of $29.3, or 11.1%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the  negative $4.8 impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, segment profit decreased $24.5, or 9.3%, due to the gross profit impact of the net sales shortfall mentioned above as well as increased A&P spending driven by the launch of EcoAdvanced. These items were partially offset by savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project.\n \u2022 Latin America segment profit was $20.7, a decrease of $5.7, or 21.6%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements. The change in Venezuela (as a result of the deconsolidation) accounted for $10.6, or 40.2%, decrease in segment profit. The go-to-market changes positively contributed $2.0, or 7.6%, to segment profit as the loss of sales was more than offset by the reduction in overhead costs. Excluding these items, segment profit increased $12.1, or 45.8%, due to a reduction in spending and favorable product costs as a result of the savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project. \n \u2022 EMEA segment profit was $58.3, a decrease of $3.1, or 5.0%, versus the prior fiscal year. Excluding $33.7 of unfavorable currency impacts and positive go-to-market changes of $1.8, organic segment profit increased $28.8, or 47.0%, due primarily to savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project and favorability due to manufacturing footprint changes. These savings enhanced the profitability of the sales increase mentioned above. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific segment profit was $77.9, a decrease of $19.2, or 19.8%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements of $19.2 and a decrease from the go-to-market changes of $0.9. Excluding the impact of these items, segment profit increased $0.9, or 0.9%, as topline shortfalls were more than offset by lower A&P spending and savings from the 2013 restructuring project. \nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL CORPORATE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General corporate and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> % of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor fiscal 2016, general corporate expenses were $80.8, an increase of $14.8 as compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to higher compensation related costs and increased investments as compared to our allocated costs from carve out methodology used in the prior year. For fiscal 2015, general corporate expenses were $66.0, an increase of $3.5 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to transitional costs incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter. For fiscal 2014, general corporate expenses were $62.5.\nGlobal marketing expenses were $19.1 in fiscal 2016, $24.8 in fiscal 2015, and $20.7 in fiscal 2014. The current year expense represents savings and efficiencies realized from managing global marketing activities using a center led approach to support our brands. The prior year periods were based on an allocation from Edgewell using a carve-out methodology. Fiscal 2015 was slightly higher due to increased support of the EcoAdvanced launch.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEnergizer's primary future cash needs will be centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation, Energizer may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit Energizer's access to capital markets, or making acquisitions using its equity as currency, potentially requiring Energizer to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d for a further discussion.\nCash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2016, Energizer had $287.3 of cash and cash equivalents, 96.2% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.\nOn June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five-year $250.0 senior secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Facility) and a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility (Term Loan) that became effective on June 30, 2015. Also on June 1, 2015, Energizer completed the issuance and sale of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (Senior Notes), with proceeds placed in escrow and released June 30, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company financed the auto care acquisition with a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility. On July 8, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing credit agreement to increase capacity on the Revolving Facility to $350.0. This additional capacity is available to be utilized for working capital and other general corporate purposes. There were no other changes to the terms of the Revolving Facility. In the month of July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin based on total Company leverage. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $52.5 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and had $6.7 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $290.8 remains available as of September 30, 2016.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreements governing the Company's debt agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these credit agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was, and expects to remain, in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements.\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016, $161.8 in fiscal 2015, and $219.9 in fiscal 2014.\nCash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016 as compared to $161.8 in the prior fiscal year. The increase of $32.1 was the result of higher net earnings in fiscal 2016, higher accounts payable due to the timing of payments and the benefit of lower inventory levels driven by increased sales volume and the benefits of initiatives that reduced days in inventory. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accruals, primarily related to the payment of spin related costs and accrued A&P expenses.\nThe decrease in cash flow of $58.1 from operating activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by lower net earnings resulting from the negative impact of currencies and cash expenditures related to the separation, most notably spent in the third fiscal quarter. The cash expenditures related to the separation were partially offset by improvements in working capital of $64.2 versus fiscal 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $371.2, $38.8, and $22.8 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The primary driver of the change in net cash used by investing activities versus the prior years was due to the cash utilized for the auto care acquisition in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures were $28.7, $40.4, and $28.4 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to IT spending associated with the separation occurring in 2015. These capital expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations. See Note 20, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment.\nInvesting cash outflows of approximately $30 to $35 are anticipated in fiscal 2017 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments. Total capital expenditures are expected to be financed with funds generated from operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities was $45.4 in 2016, net cash from financing was $309.2 in fiscal year 2015 and net cash used by financing activities was $185.5 in fiscal years 2014. For fiscal 2016, cash flow used by financing activities consists of the following:\n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan; \n \u2022 Increase on debt with maturities of 90 days or less of $58.9 representing the increase in notes payable and our Revolving Facility; \n \u2022 Dividends paid of $62.7 during the fiscal 2016 (see below); \n \u2022 Debt issuance costs of $1.6 primarily representing the fees paid as part of the July 1, 2016 bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition; \n \u2022 Purchase of treasury stock representing the cash paid for stock repurchases under the current authorization during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 (see below); and \n \u2022 Net taxes paid of $5.2 representing the liquidation of RSEAs upon vesting. \nFor fiscal 2015, cash flow from financing activities consists of the following:\n \u2022 Net cash proceeds of $999.0 resulted from the June 1, 2015 debt issuance consisting of a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility and the June 30, 2015 issuance of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025; \n \u2022 Debt issuance costs of $12.1 representing the fees paid and capitalized as part of the June 1, 2015 debt issuance; \n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the first quarter principal payment on the Term Loan; \n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities of 90 days or less representing the pay down of notes payable; \n \u2022 Dividends paid of $15.5 during fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015 (see below); and \n \u2022 Net transfers to Parent and affiliates represents the cash flow impact of Energizer's net dividend to Edgewell. The net transfers for fiscal 2015 was the result of the transfer of proceeds of the term loan and senior notes to Edgewell in connection with the contribution of certain assets including cash by Edgewell to Energizer in connection with the separation. \nNet cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 of $185.5 represents the cash flow impact of Energizer's net activity with Edgewell during that period.\nDividends\nTotal dividends declared to shareholders were $63.7 of which $62.7 were paid. The unpaid dividends were associated with unvested restricted shares and were recorded in other liabilities.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 14, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.275 per share of common stock, payable on December 15, 2016, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2016.\nShare Repurchases\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 832,971 shares for $32.6, at an average price of $39.06 per share, under this authorization. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a current liability of $0.8 for a portion of these repurchases with the cash payment occurring in the first three days of fiscal 2017. No share repurchases were made during fiscal year 2015. Future share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of Energizer's contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 is shown below:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including current maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>996.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>976.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension plans (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations and other (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,516.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,139.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The above table is based upon the debt balance and LIBOR rate as of September 30, 2016. Energizer entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one major financial institution that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $200 of Energizer's variable rate debt through June 2022 at an interest rate of 2.22%. \n (2) Globally, total pension contributions for the Company in the next year are estimated to be $5.8. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2017 are not currently estimable. \n (3) Included in the table above are $8.3 of fixed costs related to third party logistics contracts. \nEnergizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party\u201d (PRP) and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund\u201d sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.\nAccrued environmental costs at September 30, 2016 were $4.7, of which approximately $1 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2017. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses continue to increase, although due to optimization efforts, the expenditures are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, combined earnings or competitive position at this time. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management's estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to allocations from Edgewell for pre-spin periods, accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, share-based compensation, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer's significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer's accounting policies.\n \u2022 Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Energizer and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Energizer has no material equity method investments or variable interests. \nPrior to the spin-off on July 1, 2015, our financial statements were prepared on a combined standalone basis derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Edgewell and reflect the historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Energizer in accordance with GAAP. Account allocations of shared functions to Energizer were based on the allocations to the Household Products segment within Edgewell's financial statements. Shared functions between Edgewell's Household Products and Personal Care segments and Edgewell itself include product warehousing and distribution, various transaction processing functions, and in some countries, a combined sales force and management. Edgewell has historically applied a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations by Edgewell are estimates, and do not fully represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.\nThe Financial Statements are presented as if Energizer had been carved out of Edgewell for all periods prior to the spin-off. All significant transactions within Energizer were eliminated. The assets and liabilities in the carve-out financial statements were reflected on a historical cost basis, as immediately prior to the distribution all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Edgewell and were transferred to Energizer at carry-over basis.\n \u2022 Corporate Expense Allocations - These Consolidated Financial Statements include expense allocations for the periods prior to the spin-off including (1) certain product warehousing and distribution; (2) various transaction process functions; (3) a consolidated sales force and management for certain countries; (4) certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Edgewell and not recorded at the business division level, including, but not limited to, finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, facilities, and compliance; (5) employee benefits and compensation; (6) share-based compensation; (7) financing costs; (8) the effects of restructurings and the Venezuela deconsolidation; and (9) cost of early debt retirement. These expenses were allocated to Energizer on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a basis of global net sales, cost of sales, operating income, headcount or other measures of Energizer and Edgewell. Certain debt obligations of Edgewell have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Energizer prior to the spin-off, because Energizer was not a party to the obligation between Edgewell and the debt holders. Financing costs related to such debt obligations have been allocated to Energizer based on the extent to which Energizer participated in Edgewell's corporate financing activities. \nManagement believes the assumptions regarding allocated expenses, reasonably reflect the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by Energizer during the periods prior to the spin-off. Nevertheless, the allocations may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by Energizer and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been an independent standalone company. It is not practicable to estimate actual costs that would have been incurred had Energizer been a standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Energizer had been a standalone company would depend on\nmultiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition - Energizer's revenue is from the sale of its products. Revenue is recognized when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discounts is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms are final and returns or exchanges are not permitted unless a special exception is made. Reserves are established and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. \nEnergizer offers a variety of programs, such as consumer coupons and similar consumer rebate programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Promotions which reduce the ultimate consumer sale prices are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time the promotional offer is made, generally using estimated redemption and participation levels. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\n \u2022 Pension Plans - The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for pension benefits are dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds that coincide with the cash flows of its plans' estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which represent the Company's most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer yield curve in determining the discount rates. \nOf the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company's annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2016, a one percentage point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company's pre-tax pension expense by $4.6. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension obligations by $57.7 at September 30, 2016.\nAs allowed under GAAP, the Company's U.S. qualified pension plan uses Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years so it reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.\n \u2022 Share-Based Payments - The Company grants restricted stock equivalents, which generally vest over two to four years. Stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the full restriction period of the award. \n \u2022 Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims. \nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHowever, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nThe recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are likely more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we tested goodwill for impairment. There were no indications of impairment of goodwill noted during this testing. In addition, we completed impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in our various product categories. No impairment was indicated as a result of this testing.\n \u2022 Income Taxes - Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. \nWe regularly repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, these non-U.S. subsidiaries are in tax jurisdictions with effective tax rates that do not result in materially higher U.S. tax provisions related to the repatriated earnings. No provision is made for additional taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates that are intended and planned to be indefinitely invested in foreign affiliates. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 8, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet and results in each tax paying jurisdiction having either a noncurrent deferred tax asset or a noncurrent deferred tax liability. The netting of different jurisdictions' noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities is still prohibited.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company had a long term deferred tax asset balance of $63.7 and a long term deferred tax liability balance of $16.1. The Company applied this guidance retrospectively and the reclassification resulted in a long term deferred tax asset balance as of September 30, 2015 of $163.1, an increase of $49.3 to the previously reported balance. Additionally, the long term deferred tax liability increased $1.2, resulting in a balance of $8.8, as of September 30, 2015. The current portion of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability had previously been reported in Other current assets and Other current liabilities, respectively.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and FASB ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. These ASUs require most debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability rather than as an asset; however debt issuance costs relating to revolving credit facilities will remain in other assets. We adopted this standard for the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively to September 30, 2015. See Note 14, Debt. The balance for unamortized debt issuance costs that was reclassified to Debt and from Other assets was $10.7 at September 30, 2015.\nDuring the fiscal 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This guidance requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts recognized as part of a business combination in the period the adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. There was no impact on the financial statements upon adoption.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU requires tax expense to be recognized from the sale of intra-entity assets, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs, even though the effects of the transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Under the current guidance, the tax effects of transfers would have been deferred until the transferred asset was sold or otherwise recovered through use. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first interim period of a fiscal year. Upon adoption, any deferred charge established upon the intra-company transfer would be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred charge of $51.2. The Company expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. This update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact the revised guidance will have on our current classification on the Statement of Cash Flow.\nOn March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation. This new ASU simplifies the accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company currently expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU aligns the measurement of leases under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn July 22, 2015, the FASB issued a new ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), which aligns the measurement of inventory under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards. Under the new guidance, an entity that measures inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). This ASU removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair values are measured using the net asset value per share (NAV) in the fair value hierarchy. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. As a result of this ASU, Energizer's pension plan assets that are valued using their NAV will no longer be disclosed in the fair value hierarchy disclosures of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nOn April 15, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and other - internal-use software (Subtopic 350-40), which provides criteria to review cloud computing arrangements to determine whether the arrangement contains a software license or is solely a service contract. If the arrangement is determined to be a software license, fees paid to the vendor would be within the scope of internal-use software guidance. If not, the fees paid would be expensed as incurred. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. The Company's current accounting for cloud computing arrangements is consistent with this guidance.\nOn August 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-17, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The Company's first reporting date with the new standard will be December 31, 2016. We will evaluate the effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as applicable.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-09, Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries and across capital markets. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of the ASU. The update will now be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources.

We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:\n \u2022 market and economic conditions; \n \u2022 market trends in the categories in which we compete; \n \u2022 the success of new products and the ability to continually develop and market new products; \n \u2022 our ability to attract, retain and improve distribution with key customers; \n \u2022 our ability to continue planned advertising and other promotional spending; \n \u2022 our ability to timely execute strategic initiatives, including restructurings, and international go-to-market changes in a manner that will positively impact our financial condition and results of operations and does not disrupt our business operations; \n \u2022 the impact of strategic initiatives, including restructurings, on our relationships with employees, customers and vendors; \n \u2022 our ability to maintain and improve market share in the categories in which we operate despite heightened competitive pressure; \n \u2022 our ability to improve operations and realize cost savings; \n \u2022 the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls, as well as offsetting hedges, including the impact of the United Kingdom's referendum vote and announced intention to exit the European Union at some future date; \n \u2022 the impact of raw materials and other commodity costs; \n \u2022 costs and reputational damage associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches; \n \u2022 our ability to acquire and integrate businesses, and to realize the projected results of acquisitions, including our ability to integrate the auto care acquisition successfully and to achieve the anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other anticipated benefits; \n \u2022 the impact of advertising and product liability claims and other litigation; \n \u2022 compliance with debt covenants and maintenance of credit ratings as well as the impact of interest and principal repayment of our existing and any future debt; and \n \u2022 the impact of legislative or regulatory determinations or changes by federal, state and local, and foreign authorities, including taxing authorities. \nIn addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial could affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. The list of factors above is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Additional risks and uncertainties include those described in the sections entitled Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Report, as updated from time to time in the Company's public filings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period and assist investors in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:\nSegment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our four geographic segments including allocations for shared IT and finance functions. General corporate and other expenses, Global marketing expenses, Research and development (R&D) expenses, Amortization of intangible assets, interest expense and charges related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructuring, the acquisition fair value inventory step up (inventory step up), acquisition and integration have all been excluded from segment profit.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Taxes, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS. These measures exclude the impact of the costs related to the Venezuela deconsolidation, spin-off, restructurings, acquisition and integration, cost of early debt retirement, inventory step up and adjustments to prior year tax accruals.\nOrganic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue, segment profit or other margins that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of our go-to-market initiatives, the change in our Venezuela results from the deconsolidation of those operations, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:\nInternational Go-to-market initiatives. To compete more effectively as an independent company, we increased our use of exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers, and decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries, consistent with our international go-to-market strategy. In order to capture the impact of these international go-to-market changes and exits, we have separately identified the impact of these changes, which represents the year over year change in those markets since the date of exit. The impact from these changes was fully realized during the third quarter 2016.\nChange in Venezuela Results. As previously announced, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results do not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. As a result of the deconsolidation, we have taken the year over year change in Venezuela results and separately identified the impact in our change in sales and segment profit.\nImpact of acquisition. On July 1, 2016, Energizer completed its auto care acquisition. This includes the impact the auto care acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs or the one time inventory fair value step up costs associated with the auto care acquisition.\nImpact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to spin-off, restructuring, inventory step up, and acquisition and integration.\nAcquisition\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products, for a total purchase price of $340.0 plus working capital adjustments of $4.0, net of acquired cash. The Company financed the acquisition with $300.0 of cash on hand and $44.0 of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility (Revolving Facility). The Company initially utilized a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility to complete the transaction. Later in July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand. The Company incurred an additional $1.2 of interest expense in July related to this outstanding bridge loan. The Company did not incur incremental U.S. taxes from utilizing foreign cash for this transaction.\nWith the auto care acquisition, Energizer's brands now include Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL and Eagle One. The acquisition will allow the Company to expand its portfolio, increase presence at existing customers, and utilize its scale and global supply chain to drive efficiencies.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs, $1.2 of interest expense associated with the bridge loan and $8.1 of additional costs of products sold related to the inventory fair market value step up on the acquisition date. Total acquisition and integration related costs associated with the auto care acquisition are expected to be in the range of $25 to $30. We expect to incur the remaining costs during fiscal year 2017.\nThe Separation\nOn July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from Edgewell via a tax free spin-off. To effect the separation, Edgewell, undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities. As a result of these transactions, Energizer now holds the Household Products' product group and Edgewell holds the Personal Care product group. As a result of the Spin-off, Energizer now operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange trading under the symbol \"ENR.\"\nIn conjunction with the Spin-off, Edgewell distributed 62,193,281 shares of Energizer common stock to its shareholders. Under the terms of the Spin-off, Edgewell common stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 16, 2015, the record date for the distribution, received one share in Energizer for each share of Edgewell common stock they held. Edgewell completed the distribution of Energizer common stock to its shareholders on July 1, 2015, the distribution date. The transaction was structured to be tax-free to its U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEnergizer's first three fiscal quarters of 2015 as well as all of 2014 are based on carve out financial data. Net sales, Gross profit, Advertising & promotion (A&P) and R&D spending are directly attributable to our business. However, certain SG&A, Interest expense, including the cost of early debt retirement, and Spin-off and Restructuring related charges are allocated from Edgewell and not necessarily representative of Energizer's stand-alone results or expected future results of Energizer as an independent company.\nOverview\nGeneral\nEnergizer, through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the world's largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. Energizer manufactures, markets and/or licenses one of the most extensive product portfolios of household batteries, specialty batteries and portable lights. Energizer is the beneficiary of over 100 years of expertise in the battery and portable lighting products industries. Its brand names, Energizer and Eveready, have worldwide recognition for innovation, quality and dependability, and are marketed and sold around the world.\nEnergizer has a long history of innovation within our categories. Since our commercialization of the first dry-cell battery in 1893 and the first flashlight in 1899, we have been committed to developing and marketing new products to meet evolving consumer needs and consistently advancing battery technology as the universe of devices powered by batteries has evolved. Over the past 100+ years we have developed or brought to market:\n\u2022 the first flashlight;\n\u2022 the first mercury-free alkaline battery;\n\u2022 the first mercury-free hearing aid battery;\n\u2022 Energizer Ultimate Lithium, the world's longest-lasting AA and AAA battery for high-tech devices; and\n\u2022 Energizer EcoAdvanced, the world's first high performance AA battery made with 4% recycled batteries.\nToday, Energizer offers batteries using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In addition, Energizer has an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a breadth of consumer needs. We distribute, market, and/or license lighting products including headlights, lanterns, kid's lights and area lights. In addition to the Energizer and Eveready brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case, Dolphin, and WeatherReady sub-brands.\nOn July 1, 2016, Energizer expanded its portfolio of brands with the acquisition of a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. Energizer's portfolio of innovative products now includes automotive fragrance and appearance products marketed under the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama & Co., LEXOL, and Eagle One brands.\nThrough our global supply chain, global manufacturing footprint and seasoned commercial organization, we seek to meet diverse customer demands within each of the markets we serve. Energizer distributes its portfolio of batteries and lighting products through a global sales force and global distributor model. We sell our products in multiple retail and business-to-business channels, including: mass merchandisers, club, electronics, food, home improvement, dollar store, auto, drug, hardware, convenience, sporting goods, hobby/craft, e-commerce, office, industrial, medical and catalog.\nIn recent years, we have also focused on reducing our costs and improving our cash flow from operations. Our restructuring efforts and working capital initiative have resulted in substantial cost reductions and improved cash flows. These initiatives, coupled with our strong product margins over recent years, have significantly contributed to our results of operations and working capital position.\nWe use the Energizer name and logo as our trademark as well as those of our subsidiaries. Product names appearing throughout are trademarks of Energizer. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.\nEnergizer manages its business in four geographic reportable segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d), and Asia Pacific. Our four geographic segments have distinct characteristics that help Energizer deliver its strategic objectives.\nNorth America. The North America segment, including the United States and Canada, accounts for approximately 54% of global sales and 64% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales in the U.S. represent a significant majority of sales in the North America segment.\nLatin America. The Latin America segment, including Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America, accounts for approximately 7% of global sales and 5% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Sales are distributed across the modern and traditional classes of trade. While carbon zinc battery sales continue to represent a sizable portion of the overall market volume, consumption of higher priced alkaline batteries continues to grow. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength allows us to compete effectively by focusing on alkaline and carbon zinc product solutions under a premium brand and a price brand.\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 as a result of deconsolidating their Venezuelan subsidiaries, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Energizer was allocated $65.2 of this one-time charge. The Venezuela deconsolidation charge was reported on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Venezuela net sales and segment profit recognized prior to the deconsolidation, through the second quarter of fiscal 2015, are $8.5 and $2.5, respectively. Included within Energizer's fiscal year 2014 results for Venezuela are net sales of $25.8 and segment profit of $13.1. See Financial Results\u201d for further discussion.\nEMEA. The EMEA segment accounts for approximately 22% of global sales and 13% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. Premium and performance alkaline, as well as rechargeable battery penetration is high across many European markets, while carbon zinc represents the majority of the category volume in our Middle East and Africa markets. The Energizer and Eveready brands allow us to compete effectively across this diverse set of markets offering consumers and retailers a portfolio of products under a premium brand and a price brand. The demand for private label batteries remains high in certain European markets, primarily Germany, France and Spain.\nAsia Pacific. The Asia Pacific segment accounts for approximately 17% of global sales and 18% of segment profit in fiscal year 2016. The Energizer and Eveready dual brand strength provides critical mass and category leadership in certain Asia Pacific markets as we are able to offer retailers and consumers a full portfolio of products both under a premium brand and a price brand. The competitive environment in certain markets has been elevated throughout the current fiscal year due to increased private label activity driven by certain discount retailers.\nFinancial Results\nNet earnings for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was $127.7, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $4.0, or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share, and net earnings of $157.3, or $2.53 per diluted share, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nEarnings/(loss) before income taxes, net earnings/(loss) and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) for the time periods presented were impacted by certain items related to the Spin-off transaction, cost of early debt retirement, restructuring and realignment costs, acquisition and integration costs, acquisition inventory step up costs, Venezuela deconsolidation and adjustments to prior year tax accruals as described in the tables below. The impact of these items on reported earnings/(loss) before income taxes, reported net earnings/(loss) and reported EPS are provided below as a reconciliation to arrive at respective non-GAAP measures. See disclosure under Non-GAAP Financial Measures above.\n\n(1) Includes pre-tax costs of $10.0, $97.6 and $21.3 recorded in SG&A for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $0.4 and $0.5 recorded in cost of products sold for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n(2) Included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n(3) Includes pre-tax costs of $2.4, $3.1, and $1.0 for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, recorded within Cost of products sold and $0.3 and $5.9 for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, recorded in SG&A on the Combined Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n(4) Includes pre-tax costs of $10.0 recorded in SG&A and $1.2 recorded in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 and $0.3 recorded in Cost of products sold and $1.3 recorded in SG&A for the year ended September 30, 2015.\n(5) Included in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.\n(6) The effective tax rate for the Adjusted - Non-GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted EPS was 29.8%, 27.0%, and 27.5% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, respectively, as calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the costs were incurred.\n(7) Basic and diluted earnings per common share and the average number of common shares outstanding were retrospectively restated for fiscal years 2014 for the number of Energizer shares outstanding immediately following the July 1, 2015 Spin-off. For twelve months ended September 30, 2015, adjusted earnings per share is calculated utilizing the diluted weighted average shares as the Company has Adjusted - Non GAAP net earnings rather than a loss.\nOperating Results\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 increased 0.2%. The increase was driven by the impact of the auto care acquisition on July 1, 2016 which added $32.3, or 2.0%, as well as the increase in organic sales of $60.4, or 3.7%. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency of $66.9, or 4.1%, $8.5, or 0.5%, due to the change in Venezuela results as a result of the deconsolidation and $14.7, or 0.9%, related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Organic net sales increased 3.7% primarily due to:\n \u2022 Net distribution and space gain which accounted for 2.3% of the total organic increase; \n \u2022 Pricing actions and the timing of holiday shipments; \n \u2022 Partially offset by heightened competitive activity in certain Asia developed markets. \nNet sales for the year ended September 30, 2015 decreased 11.3%, inclusive of a $109.7, or 5.9%, due to the unfavorable impact of currency movements, $17.3, or 0.9%, due to change in Venezuela results as a result of the deconsolidation and $16.4, or 0.9%, related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of these unfavorable items, organic sales decreased $65.4, or 3.6%, primarily due to:\n \u2022 The timing of holiday shipments and temporary prior year shelf gains that were not repeated in the current fiscal year which account for 4.7% of the total organic net sales decline; \n \u2022 Partially offset by space and distribution gains, primarily in Western Europe, which accounted for 1.1%. \nFor further discussion regarding net sales in each of our geographic segments, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, please see the section titled Segment Results\u201d provided below.\nGross Profit\nGross profit dollars were $712.4 in fiscal 2016 versus $756.2 in fiscal 2015. The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $60.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 was 43.6% compared to 46.3% in the prior year. Excluding the impact from the one-time accounting adjustment ($8.1) related to the fair market value step up of the auto care acquisition inventory and spin and integration charges ($2.8 in fiscal 2016 and $3.9 in fiscal 2015), gross margin percentage was 44.3% or 230 basis points below prior year. This change was driven by a 180 basis point impact due to an unfavorable movement in currencies, increased costs related to planned as well as accelerated discrete productivity initiatives and increased costs in support of product innovation.\nGross profit dollars were $756.2 in fiscal 2015 versus $850.4 in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the decline in net sales mentioned earlier and unfavorable foreign currency movements of approximately $99.\nGross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2015 was 46.3% which was flat against the prior year. Excluding the impacts of currencies of approximately $99, change in Venezuela results of $13.5 and international go-to-market changes of\napproximately $4, the gross margin rate increased 330 basis points from continued cost reductions and modest commodity cost favorability.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSG&A expenses were $352.6 in fiscal 2016, or 21.6% of net sales as compared to $426.3, or 26.1% of net sales for fiscal 2015 and $391.3, or 21.3% of net sales for fiscal 2014. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2016 was separation charges of $10.0 related to the execution of the Spin-off transaction as well as $10.0 of acquisition and integration costs related to the auto care acquisition. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2015 was approximately $107 of special charges. Separation charges of $97.6 were included in this amount and primarily related to the execution of the spin-off transaction. Also included were approximately $9 related to integration, restructuring initiatives and transitional expenses related to the separation. Similarly, fiscal year 2014 included $5.9 of charges directly associated with our restructuring initiatives that were recorded within SG&A. In addition, fiscal 2014 also included $21.3 of pretax separation related charges. Excluding the impacts of these items, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 20.4% in fiscal 2016 as compared to 20.0% in fiscal 2015 and 19.8% in fiscal 2014.\nAdvertising and Sales Promotion\nA&P was $102.4, down $29.9 as compared to fiscal 2015. A&P as a percent of net sales was 6.3% for fiscal 2016 and was 8.1% and 6.6% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower level of A&P spending as a percent of net sales in fiscal years 2016 versus 2015 was due to higher prior year spending related to the EcoAdvanced product launch. The higher level of A&P spending as a percentage of net sales in fiscal years 2015 versus 2014 was due to increased support behind our brands and the launch of EcoAdvanced, which occurred in the second fiscal quarter of 2015. A&P expense may vary from year to year due to new product launches, strategic brand support initiatives, the overall competitive environment, as well as the type of A&P spending.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expense was $26.6 in fiscal 2016, $24.9 in fiscal 2015 and $25.3 in fiscal 2014. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was 1.6% in fiscal 2016, 1.5% in fiscal 2015 and 1.4% in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal year 2016 was due to the auto care acquisition and planned spending in support of product innovation. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to cost reductions as a result of our 2013 restructuring project.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2016 was $54.3, a decrease of $23.6 as compared to fiscal 2015. The current period expense is related to the outstanding term loan and senior note at September 30, 2016, $1.2 of expense from the bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition, increased debt outstanding on the credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as the impact of the interest rate swap during the year. Included within fiscal 2015 interest expense were debt breakage fees of $26.7, which were allocated to Energizer in the third fiscal quarter as a result of the April notice of prepayment to the holders of Edgewell's outstanding notes. Excluding the debt breakage fees, interest was $51.2, down $1.5 in comparison to fiscal 2014. This was due primarily to lower interest costs resulting from lower average interest rates on debt outstanding. Interest expense for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 and all of fiscal 2014 was based on an allocation from Edgewell.\nOther Financing Income, Net\nOther financing, net was income of $0.3 in fiscal 2016 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income which were almost fully offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures and an impairment charge on an available for sale security of $2.0. Other financing, net was income of $18.4 in fiscal 2015 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains, interest income and net revaluation gains on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures. In fiscal 2014, Other financing, net was expense of $0.7 reflecting the net impact of hedging contract gains and interest income offset by revaluation losses on nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.\nIncome Taxes\nFor fiscal 2016, the effective tax rate was 22.9%, which was favorably impacted by certain return to provision adjustments related to prior year provision estimates and certain spin related adjustments of $11.4. In addition, the rate was favorably impacted by costs related to integration, separation and restructuring charges as a majority of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 29.8%.\nFor fiscal 2015, the effective tax rate was 455.1%. This rate was largely impacted by the Venezuela deconsolidation charge of $65.2, which had no accompanying tax benefit. Partially offsetting this expense were pre-tax losses in high tax rate jurisdictions driven by spin costs of $137.2, interest payments as a result of the early debt retirement of $26.7 and restructuring charges of $13.0. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was 27.0%.\nFor fiscal 2014, the effective tax rate was 26.9%, which was favorably impacted by costs related to the separation and the 2013 restructuring project. Both of these charges were primarily incurred in the U.S., which resulted in a higher tax benefit as compared to our overall global effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of these items, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was 27.5%. This rate was more favorable versus the prior year due to the mix of countries from which earnings were derived as foreign earnings increased in lower tax rate countries, most significantly Singapore.\nEnergizer's effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates.\nVenezuela Deconsolidation Charge\nVenezuelan exchange control regulations have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and have restricted our Venezuelan operations' ability to pay dividends and settle intercompany obligations. The severe currency controls imposed by the Venezuelan government have significantly limited Energizer's ability to realize the benefits from earnings of Energizer's Venezuelan operations and access the resulting liquidity provided by those earnings. Energizer expects that this condition will continue for the foreseeable future. This lack of exchangeability has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries for accounting purposes. We deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries on March 31, 2015 and began accounting for our investment in our Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, our financial results will not include the operating results of our Venezuelan operations. Instead, we will record revenue for sales of inventory to our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements to the extent cash is received. Further, dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as other income upon receipt of the cash. Included within the results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, for Venezuela are net sales of $8.5 and segment profit of $2.5. See further discussion in \"Segment Results\" below.\nAs a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan subsidiaries at March 31, 2015, Edgewell recorded a one-time charge of $144.5 in the second quarter of 2015, of which $65.2 was allocated to Energizer based on the Venezuelan operations being distributed as part of Energizer. This charge included:\n \u2022 foreign currency translation losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, of which $16.2 was allocated to Energizer \n \u2022 the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' cash balance, of which $44.6 was allocated to Energizer, (at the 6.30 per U.S. dollar rate) \n \u2022 the write-off of Edgewell's Venezuelan operations' other net assets, of which $4.4 was allocated to Energizer \nSpin Costs\nThe Company incurred costs associated with the evaluation, planning and execution of the spin transaction.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $16.2 in spin costs including $10.0 recorded in SG&A, $0.4 recorded in cost of products sold and $5.8 recorded in spin restructuring. Included in spin restructuring were contract termination costs related to the exit of a corporate office building as we right-sized our headquarters' footprint. The contract termination costs were $3.7 based on the estimated fair value of the future cash flows associated with this operating lease.\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded spin costs of $163.9, of which $97.6 was recorded in SG&A, $0.5 was recorded in cost of products sold, $39.1 was recorded in spin restructuring and $26.7 of cost of early debt retirement was recorded in interest expense. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded spin costs of $21.3 all of which was recorded in SG&A.\nOn a project to date basis, the total costs incurred and allocated to Energizer for the spin-off were $201.4, inclusive of the costs of early debt retirement recorded in fiscal 2015. Energizer expects remaining spin costs, if any, to be immaterial.\n2013 Restructuring\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Energizer recorded $2.5 in pre-tax restructuring charges related to the 2013 restructuring project as compared to $9.6 and $43.5 in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Restructuring charges were reflected on a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. In addition, pre-tax costs of $3.1 and $1.0 associated with certain inventory obsolescence charges were recorded within Cost of products sold and $0.3 and $5.9 associated with information technology enablement activities were recorded within SG&A on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These inventory obsolescence and information technology costs are considered part of the total project costs incurred for the 2013 restructuring project.\nThe 2013 Restructuring Project is complete and the full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings exceeded $218. The primary impacts of savings were reflected in improved gross margin and lower overhead expenses. Savings related to the 2013 restructuring project were fully realized as of June 30, 2015.\nSegment Results\nOperations for Energizer are managed via four geographic segments - North America (U.S. and Canada), Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with most restructuring initiatives, business realignment activities, R&D, amortization of intangible assets and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of substantially all restructuring and realignment costs from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.\nEnergizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis. This structure is the basis for Energizer's reportable operating segment information, as included in the tables in Note 20, Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2016.\n\nTotal net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 increased 0.2%, including organic sales increase of $60.4, or 3.7%, and sales related to the auto care acquisition of $32.3, or 2.0%. These increases were substantially offset by a $66.9 decrease due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $8.5 change in Venezuela results (as a result of deconsolidation) and $14.7 related to the impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America net sales improved 7.2% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 0.6% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The auto care acquisition improved net sales by 3.3%. Excluding the impact of currency movement and the acquisition, organic net sales increased 4.5%. This increase was due to net distribution and space gains and the timing of holiday shipments. \n \u2022 Latin America net sales declined 11.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 17.1% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The deconsolidation of Venezuela accounted for a 6.8% year-over-year decline, the auto care acquisition improved net sales by 1.4%, and the go-to-market impacts had a negative impact of 1.6%. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, Venezuela, the acquisition and the go-to-market changes, organic net sales increased 12.5% driven by positive volume contributions, including the launch of EcoAdvanced in certain markets, distribution gains and pricing actions taken across multiple markets. \n \u2022 EMEA net sales declined 4.5% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 7.4% decline due to unfavorable currency movements. The go-to-market impacts associated with market exits and distributors negatively impacted net sales by 0.9%. The auto care acquisition improved net sales by 0.6%. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, go-to-market changes, and the acquisition, organic net sales improved 3.2% driven by positive volume contribution from distribution gains in certain Western and Eastern European markets, pricing actions in certain markets and the continued launch of EcoAdvanced in additional markets. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific net sales declined 8.7% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 4.4% decline due to unfavorable currency movements, a 3.0% decline associated with the go-to-market changes, and a 0.3% increase due to the auto care acquisition. Excluding the impacts of currency movements, go-to-market changes and the acquisition, organic net sales decreased 1.6% driven by continued competitive pressures in certain Asia developed markets slightly offset by distribution gains and positive volume contributions in select markets. \nNet sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 decreased 11.3%, including a decrease of $109.7 due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $17.3 change in Venezuela results (as a result of Edgewell's previously announced deconsolidation and $16.4 related to the initial impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic sales decreased $65.4, or 3.6%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America net sales declined 8.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 0.9% decline due to unfavorable impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales declined 7.7% due primarily to the timing of holiday and promotional shipments and temporary fiscal 2014 shelf gains that were not repeated in fiscal 2015, partially offset by increased shipments related to the EcoAdvanced new product launch during the second fiscal quarter. \n \u2022 Latin America net sales declined 22.8% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 9.7% decline due to unfavorable  currency movements. The deconsolidation of Venezuela accounted for a 10.7% year-over-year decline while the go-to-market impacts had a negative impact of 2.7%. Excluding the impact of currency movements, Venezuela and the go-to-market changes, organic net sales increased 0.3% as pricing gains across several markets were partially offset by volume declines due to the timing of holiday shipments and continued category declines.\n \u2022 EMEA net sales declined 11.6% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 14.2% decrease due to unfavorable currency movements. The go-to-market impacts associated with market exits and distributors positively contributed to net sales by 0.3% due to pipeline fills associated with distributor changes. Excluding the impact of currency movements go-to-market changes, organic net sales improved 2.3% due to volume increases associated with new distribution, the continued roll out of EcoAdvanced and increased space gains in Western Europe. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific net sales declined 12.9% versus the prior fiscal year, inclusive of a 7.5% decline due to unfavorable currency movements and a 3.8% decline associated with the go-to-market changes. Excluding the impact of currency movements and go-to-market changes, organic net sales decreased 1.6% due to phasing of shipments and heightened competitive pressures in two of our major markets, Australia and Korea. \n\nRefer to Note 20, Segments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation from segment profit to earnings before income taxes.\nTotal segment profit in fiscal 2016 was $388.2, a decrease of 0.8% versus the prior fiscal year, including a decrease of $46.6, or 11.8%, due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates and a $2.5 decrease due to the change in Venezuela results (due to the deconsolidation). These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $9.5, or 2.4%, from the auto care acquisition impact, a $1.7 increase related to the impact of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors), and organic segment profit increase of 8.8%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America segment profit was $247.6, an increase of $13.0, or 5.5%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive \nof the negative $3.6 impact of currency movements and $6.9 increase due to the auto care acquisition. Excluding the impact of currency movements and the acquisition, segment profit increased $9.7, or 4.1%, driven by strong top-line performance, favorable commodity costs and lower A&P spend due to the prior year launch of EcoAdvanced. These items were partially offset by increased costs related to planned as well as accelerated discrete productivity initiatives and increased costs in support of product innovation.\n \u2022 Latin America segment profit was $18.9, a decrease of $1.8, or 8.7%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative $13.8 impact of currency movements. The change in Venezuela (as a result of the deconsolidation) accounted for $2.5, or 12.1%, decrease in segment profit. The go-to-market changes positively contributed $2.5, or 12.1%, to segment profit as the loss of sales was more than offset by a reduction in overhead costs and a $0.9 increase in segment profit is attributable to the auto care acquisition. Excluding these items, organic segment profit increased $11.1, or 53.6%. This increase was driven by an improvement in organic sales driven by positive volume contributions, including the launch of EcoAdvanced in certain markets, distribution gains and pricing actions taken across multiple markets. These increases were partially offset by higher overhead spending due primarily to inflationary increases. \n \u2022 EMEA segment profit was $51.6, a decrease of $6.7, or 11.5%, versus the prior fiscal year. Excluding $19.3 of unfavorable currency impacts, negative impact from go-to-market changes of $1.0 and positive contribution from the auto care acquisition of $1.2, organic segment profit increased $12.4, or 21.3%, due to positive volume contribution from distribution gains in certain Western and Eastern European markets, the continued launch of EcoAdvanced in additional markets and a reduction in A&P and overhead spending. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific segment profit was $70.1, a decrease of $7.8, or 10.0%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements of $9.9, an increase from go-to-market changes of $0.2 and growth due to the auto care acquisition of $0.5. Excluding the impact of these items, segment profit increased $1.4, or 1.8%, driven by distribution gains and positive volume contributions in select markets as well as lower A&P and overhead spending. \nTotal segment profit in fiscal 2015 was $391.5, a decrease of 12.8% versus the prior fiscal year, including a decrease of $66.9, or 14.9%, due to unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates, a $10.6 decrease due to the change in Venezuela results (due to the previously announced deconsolidation) and a $2.9 increase related to the initial impacts of the international go-to-market changes (including exits and shift to distributors). Excluding the impact of these items, organic segment profit increased 3.9%. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 North America segment profit was $234.6, a decrease of $29.3, or 11.1%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the  negative $4.8 impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of currency movements, segment profit decreased $24.5, or 9.3%, due to the gross profit impact of the net sales shortfall mentioned above as well as increased A&P spending driven by the launch of EcoAdvanced. These items were partially offset by savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project.\n \u2022 Latin America segment profit was $20.7, a decrease of $5.7, or 21.6%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements. The change in Venezuela (as a result of the deconsolidation) accounted for $10.6, or 40.2%, decrease in segment profit. The go-to-market changes positively contributed $2.0, or 7.6%, to segment profit as the loss of sales was more than offset by the reduction in overhead costs. Excluding these items, segment profit increased $12.1, or 45.8%, due to a reduction in spending and favorable product costs as a result of the savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project. \n \u2022 EMEA segment profit was $58.3, a decrease of $3.1, or 5.0%, versus the prior fiscal year. Excluding $33.7 of unfavorable currency impacts and positive go-to-market changes of $1.8, organic segment profit increased $28.8, or 47.0%, due primarily to savings realized from the 2013 restructuring project and favorability due to manufacturing footprint changes. These savings enhanced the profitability of the sales increase mentioned above. \n \u2022 Asia Pacific segment profit was $77.9, a decrease of $19.2, or 19.8%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the negative impact of currency movements of $19.2 and a decrease from the go-to-market changes of $0.9. Excluding the impact of these items, segment profit increased $0.9, or 0.9%, as topline shortfalls were more than offset by lower A&P spending and savings from the 2013 restructuring project. \n\nFor fiscal 2016, general corporate expenses were $80.8, an increase of $14.8 as compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to higher compensation related costs and increased investments as compared to our allocated costs from carve out methodology used in the prior year. For fiscal 2015, general corporate expenses were $66.0, an increase of $3.5 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to transitional costs incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter. For fiscal 2014, general corporate expenses were $62.5.\nGlobal marketing expenses were $19.1 in fiscal 2016, $24.8 in fiscal 2015, and $20.7 in fiscal 2014. The current year expense represents savings and efficiencies realized from managing global marketing activities using a center led approach to support our brands. The prior year periods were based on an allocation from Edgewell using a carve-out methodology. Fiscal 2015 was slightly higher due to increased support of the EcoAdvanced launch.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEnergizer's primary future cash needs will be centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. Moreover, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation, Energizer may not be able to engage in certain strategic or capital-raising transactions following the separation, such as issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, which may limit Energizer's access to capital markets, or making acquisitions using its equity as currency, potentially requiring Energizer to issue more debt than would otherwise be optimal. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors\u201d for a further discussion.\nCash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2016, Energizer had $287.3 of cash and cash equivalents, 96.2% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.\nOn June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five-year $250.0 senior secured revolving credit facility (Revolving Facility) and a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility (Term Loan) that became effective on June 30, 2015. Also on June 1, 2015, Energizer completed the issuance and sale of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (Senior Notes), with proceeds placed in escrow and released June 30, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, the Company financed the auto care acquisition with a $200.0 bridge loan and $144.0 of borrowings on our Revolving Facility. On July 8, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing credit agreement to increase capacity on the Revolving Facility to $350.0. This additional capacity is available to be utilized for working capital and other general corporate purposes. There were no other changes to the terms of the Revolving Facility. In the month of July, the bridge loan and $100.0 of our Revolving Facility borrowings were paid down utilizing cash on hand.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus the applicable margin based on total Company leverage. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $52.5 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and had $6.7 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $290.8 remains available as of September 30, 2016.\nDebt Covenants\nThe credit agreements governing the Company's debt agreements contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these credit agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was, and expects to remain, in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements.\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016, $161.8 in fiscal 2015, and $219.9 in fiscal 2014.\nCash flow from operating activities was $193.9 in fiscal 2016 as compared to $161.8 in the prior fiscal year. The increase of $32.1 was the result of higher net earnings in fiscal 2016, higher accounts payable due to the timing of payments and the benefit of lower inventory levels driven by increased sales volume and the benefits of initiatives that reduced days in inventory. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accruals, primarily related to the payment of spin related costs and accrued A&P expenses.\nThe decrease in cash flow of $58.1 from operating activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by lower net earnings resulting from the negative impact of currencies and cash expenditures related to the separation, most notably spent in the third fiscal quarter. The cash expenditures related to the separation were partially offset by improvements in working capital of $64.2 versus fiscal 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $371.2, $38.8, and $22.8 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The primary driver of the change in net cash used by investing activities versus the prior years was due to the cash utilized for the auto care acquisition in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures were $28.7, $40.4, and $28.4 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to IT spending associated with the separation occurring in 2015. These capital expenditures were funded by cash flow from operations. See Note 20, Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures by segment.\nInvesting cash outflows of approximately $30 to $35 are anticipated in fiscal 2017 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments. Total capital expenditures are expected to be financed with funds generated from operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities was $45.4 in 2016, net cash from financing was $309.2 in fiscal year 2015 and net cash used by financing activities was $185.5 in fiscal years 2014. For fiscal 2016, cash flow used by financing activities consists of the following:\n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan; \n \u2022 Increase on debt with maturities of 90 days or less of $58.9 representing the increase in notes payable and our Revolving Facility; \n \u2022 Dividends paid of $62.7 during the fiscal 2016 (see below); \n \u2022 Debt issuance costs of $1.6 primarily representing the fees paid as part of the July 1, 2016 bridge loan associated with the auto care acquisition; \n \u2022 Purchase of treasury stock representing the cash paid for stock repurchases under the current authorization during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 (see below); and \n \u2022 Net taxes paid of $5.2 representing the liquidation of RSEAs upon vesting. \nFor fiscal 2015, cash flow from financing activities consists of the following:\n \u2022 Net cash proceeds of $999.0 resulted from the June 1, 2015 debt issuance consisting of a seven-year $400.0 senior secured term loan B facility and the June 30, 2015 issuance of $600.0 of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2025; \n \u2022 Debt issuance costs of $12.1 representing the fees paid and capitalized as part of the June 1, 2015 debt issuance; \n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities greater than 90 days representing the first quarter principal payment on the Term Loan; \n \u2022 Payments on debt with maturities of 90 days or less representing the pay down of notes payable; \n \u2022 Dividends paid of $15.5 during fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015 (see below); and \n \u2022 Net transfers to Parent and affiliates represents the cash flow impact of Energizer's net dividend to Edgewell. The net transfers for fiscal 2015 was the result of the transfer of proceeds of the term loan and senior notes to Edgewell in connection with the contribution of certain assets including cash by Edgewell to Energizer in connection with the separation. \nNet cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 of $185.5 represents the cash flow impact of Energizer's net activity with Edgewell during that period.\nDividends\nTotal dividends declared to shareholders were $63.7 of which $62.7 were paid. The unpaid dividends were associated with unvested restricted shares and were recorded in other liabilities.\nSubsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 14, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.275 per share of common stock, payable on December 15, 2016, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2016.\nShare Repurchases\nOn July 1, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 832,971 shares for $32.6, at an average price of $39.06 per share, under this authorization. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a current liability of $0.8 for a portion of these repurchases with the cash payment occurring in the first three days of fiscal 2017. No share repurchases were made during fiscal year 2015. Future share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of Energizer's contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 is shown below:\n\n (1) The above table is based upon the debt balance and LIBOR rate as of September 30, 2016. Energizer entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one major financial institution that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $200 of Energizer's variable rate debt through June 2022 at an interest rate of 2.22%. \n (2) Globally, total pension contributions for the Company in the next year are estimated to be $5.8. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2017 are not currently estimable. \n (3) Included in the table above are $8.3 of fixed costs related to third party logistics contracts. \nEnergizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party\u201d (PRP) and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund\u201d sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.\nAccrued environmental costs at September 30, 2016 were $4.7, of which approximately $1 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2017. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses continue to increase, although due to optimization efforts, the expenditures are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, combined earnings or competitive position at this time. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount\ncannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management's estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to allocations from Edgewell for pre-spin periods, accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, share-based compensation, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nThe Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer's significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer's accounting policies.\n \u2022 Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Energizer and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Energizer has no material equity method investments or variable interests. \nPrior to the spin-off on July 1, 2015, our financial statements were prepared on a combined standalone basis derived from the financial statements and accounting records of Edgewell and reflect the historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Energizer in accordance with GAAP. Account allocations of shared functions to Energizer were based on the allocations to the Household Products segment within Edgewell's financial statements. Shared functions between Edgewell's Household Products and Personal Care segments and Edgewell itself include product warehousing and distribution, various transaction processing functions, and in some countries, a combined sales force and management. Edgewell has historically applied a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments. Such allocations by Edgewell are estimates, and do not fully represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.\nThe Financial Statements are presented as if Energizer had been carved out of Edgewell for all periods prior to the spin-off. All significant transactions within Energizer were eliminated. The assets and liabilities in the carve-out financial statements were reflected on a historical cost basis, as immediately prior to the distribution all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by Edgewell and were transferred to Energizer at carry-over basis.\n \u2022 Corporate Expense Allocations - These Consolidated Financial Statements include expense allocations for the periods prior to the spin-off including (1) certain product warehousing and distribution; (2) various transaction process functions; (3) a consolidated sales force and management for certain countries; (4) certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Edgewell and not recorded at the business division level, including, but not limited to, finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, facilities, and compliance; (5) employee benefits and compensation; (6) share-based compensation; (7) financing costs; (8) the effects of restructurings and the Venezuela deconsolidation; and (9) cost of early debt retirement. These expenses were allocated to Energizer on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a basis of global net sales, cost of sales, operating income, headcount or other measures of Energizer and Edgewell. Certain debt obligations of Edgewell have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Energizer prior to the spin-off, because Energizer was not a party to the obligation between Edgewell and the debt holders. Financing costs related to such debt obligations have been allocated to Energizer based on the extent to which Energizer participated in Edgewell's corporate financing activities. \nManagement believes the assumptions regarding allocated expenses, reasonably reflect the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by Energizer during the periods prior to the spin-off. Nevertheless, the allocations may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by Energizer and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows had we been an independent standalone company. It is not practicable to estimate actual costs that would have been incurred had Energizer been a standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Energizer had been a standalone company would depend on\nmultiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition - Energizer's revenue is from the sale of its products. Revenue is recognized when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discounts is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms are final and returns or exchanges are not permitted unless a special exception is made. Reserves are established and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. \nEnergizer offers a variety of programs, such as consumer coupons and similar consumer rebate programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Promotions which reduce the ultimate consumer sale prices are recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time the promotional offer is made, generally using estimated redemption and participation levels. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.\n \u2022 Pension Plans - The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for pension benefits are dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds that coincide with the cash flows of its plans' estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which represent the Company's most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer yield curve in determining the discount rates. \nOf the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company's annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2016, a one percentage point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company's pre-tax pension expense by $4.6. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension obligations by $57.7 at September 30, 2016.\nAs allowed under GAAP, the Company's U.S. qualified pension plan uses Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years so it reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.\n \u2022 Share-Based Payments - The Company grants restricted stock equivalents, which generally vest over two to four years. Stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the full restriction period of the award. \n \u2022 Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims. \nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nHowever, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.\nThe recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are likely more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we tested goodwill for impairment. There were no indications of impairment of goodwill noted during this testing. In addition, we completed impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in our various product categories. No impairment was indicated as a result of this testing.\n \u2022 Income Taxes - Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. \nWe regularly repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, these non-U.S. subsidiaries are in tax jurisdictions with effective tax rates that do not result in materially higher U.S. tax provisions related to the repatriated earnings. No provision is made for additional taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates that are intended and planned to be indefinitely invested in foreign affiliates. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 8, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet and results in each tax paying jurisdiction having either a noncurrent deferred tax asset or a noncurrent deferred tax liability. The netting of different jurisdictions' noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities is still prohibited.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company had a long term deferred tax asset balance of $63.7 and a long term deferred tax liability balance of $16.1. The Company applied this guidance retrospectively and the reclassification resulted in a long term deferred tax asset balance as of September 30, 2015 of $163.1, an increase of $49.3 to the previously reported balance. Additionally, the long term deferred tax liability increased $1.2, resulting in a balance of $8.8, as of September 30, 2015. The current portion of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability had previously been reported in Other current assets and Other current liabilities, respectively.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and FASB ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. These ASUs require most debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability rather than as an asset; however debt issuance costs relating to revolving credit facilities will remain in other assets. We adopted this standard for the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively to September 30, 2015. See Note 14, Debt. The balance for unamortized debt issuance costs that was reclassified to Debt and from Other assets was $10.7 at September 30, 2015.\nDuring the fiscal 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This guidance requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts recognized as part of a business combination in the period the adjustments are determined, rather than retrospectively adjusting previously reported amounts. There was no impact on the financial statements upon adoption.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU requires tax expense to be recognized from the sale of intra-entity assets, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs, even though the effects of the transaction are eliminated in consolidation. Under the current guidance, the tax effects of transfers would have been deferred until the transferred asset was sold or otherwise recovered through use. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first interim period of a fiscal year. Upon adoption, any deferred charge established upon the intra-company transfer would be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a deferred charge of $51.2. The Company expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOn August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statements of cash flows. This update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact the revised guidance will have on our current classification on the Statement of Cash Flow.\nOn March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation. This new ASU simplifies the accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company currently expects to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\nOn February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU aligns the measurement of leases under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn July 22, 2015, the FASB issued a new ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330), which aligns the measurement of inventory under GAAP more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards. Under the new guidance, an entity that measures inventory using the first-in, first-out or average cost should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable\nvalue. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.\nOn May 1, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). This ASU removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair values are measured using the net asset value per share (NAV) in the fair value hierarchy. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. As a result of this ASU, Energizer's pension plan assets that are valued using their NAV will no longer be disclosed in the fair value hierarchy disclosures of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements.\nOn April 15, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and other - internal-use software (Subtopic 350-40), which provides criteria to review cloud computing arrangements to determine whether the arrangement contains a software license or is solely a service contract. If the arrangement is determined to be a software license, fees paid to the vendor would be within the scope of internal-use software guidance. If not, the fees paid would be expensed as incurred. The update will be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2016. The Company's current accounting for cloud computing arrangements is consistent with this guidance.\nOn August 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-17, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to assess the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The standard is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The Company's first reporting date with the new standard will be December 31, 2016. We will evaluate the effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as applicable.\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued a new ASU 2014-09, Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries and across capital markets. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of the ASU. The update will now be effective for Energizer beginning October 1, 2018. Energizer is in the process of evaluating the impact the revised guidance will have on its financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For The Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Earnings/(Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted EPS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported -
